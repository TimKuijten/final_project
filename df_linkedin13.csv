Early on in their journey, an aspect they felt was important was measuring how colleagues feel about the changes being implemented as a result of the transformation. They use the Kubler-Ross change curve as a guide.Using the Change Journey Navigator insights tool, they are able to establish the impact of the changes by monitoring how the communication is landing with colleagues and thereby understand where to focus attention to improve clarity and increase engagement.An important end result is to have everyone across the company feeling they are part of the change, empowered to re-imagine their roles to better serve their customers, their suppliers and each other.Click for more info on the event:https://lnkd.in/eG8mNgr7For more information on Change Journey Navigator go to:https://lnkd.in/e8muSMGT",25 minutes ago

Michael Watson,4,,1 repost,"In February 2021, Spotify announced a policy that allowed their employees to work from anywhere. Spotify's results at the 18-month juncture are summarized in the World Economic Forum video (link is below).A few highlights of the impact of this change include:Staff turnover dropped by 15%. This is probably the result of employees having access to a desirable level of flexibility.Between 2019 and 2021, women in leadership increased from 25% to 42%. In surveys, women have indicated less interest in coming into an office to work and greater interest in balancing their personal life and work responsibilities. The work from anywhere policy meets those needs.Black and Hispanic staff grew from 12.7% to 18%. Another advantage of this policy is that it enables Spotify to recruit employees from anywhere in the country, without the requirement of moving to a central location. If everything is equal, an organization that allows you to take a new job while remaining near family and friends is more attractive than a job offer that requires you to move. This policy makes recruiting and retaining diverse staff easier.This new policy does not appear to have affected Spotify's subscriber growth. At the end of January, Spotify became the first music streaming service to surpass 200 million paid subscribers.Spotify has demonstrated what is possible when you offer policies that meet the needs of employees.https://buff.ly/3Lo823V#leaders#leadership#managers#management",44 minutes ago

It is a pretty simple shell script, but the greater point is that the organization has offered this type of recovery tool at all.In the past, most government organizations have taken a hands-off approach to assisting victims, other than investigations of criminal activity. This new approach is welcome, I think, because the market hasn't produced accepted options for recovery tools. Of course, you can engage, and probably should engage, your cyber insurance and incident response providers when help is needed.

I've seen this in action, and it is AWESOME. We are in beta now, and the blind and low-visioned community, through Be My Eyes, will help shape this great leap forward for world-wide accessibility.Users can send images via our app to an AI-powered Virtual Volunteer, which will answer any question about that image and provide instantaneous visual assistance for a wide variety of tasks. What sets the Virtual Volunteer tool apart from other image-to-text technology available today is superior recognition and context, a deeper level of understanding, and a conversational ability not yet seen in the digital assistant field.

Because of this, 2/3 of Black women change their hair for a job interview. The pressure is even higher for young professionals, as nearly half (44%) of Black women under 34 feel pressured to have a headshot with straight hair.Bias and discrimination against natural hairstyles in the workplace remains a systemic problem, with a disproportionate impact on Black women. No one should be denied access to employment opportunities or professional advancement because of their hair. That‚Äôs why Dove co-founded the CROWN Coalition to help make race-based hair discrimination illegal through the CROWN Act. We‚Äôve made great progress, but there‚Äôs still work to be done.I‚Äôm excited to announce that Dove is partnering with LinkedIn‚Äìthe world‚Äôs largest professional network‚Äìin support of the CROWN Act, to create more inclusive and equitable spaces for Black hair at work. Dove will continue to drive awareness for the CROWN Act, encourage petition signatures, and advocate for legislation to end hair discrimination nationwide, and together with LinkedIn, take a series of actions to help end race-based hair discrimination in the workplace:Provide free access to 10 LinkedIn Learning courses focused on creating a more equitable work environment, with a goal to educate 1 million hiring managers and professionals by the end of 2023.Illuminate the real and measurable adverse impact hair discrimination continues to have on Black women in the workplace through the CROWN 2023 Workplace Research StudyAmplify the real stories and voices of Black women to help redefine what society deems ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù for the workplaceTogether, we are reinforcing and celebrating that#BlackHairIsProfessional.Join us in taking action.

Apenas consigo unas pr√°cticas mal pagadas y sin ning√∫n tipo de beneficio. Hago las maletas y me voy a Argentina.2014: me echan de mi primer trabajo en agencia, no supero el periodo de prueba, es primer trabajo desde que estoy en Buenos Aires (bueno, mi primer trabajo, a secas). Me cost√≥ encontrarlo 6 meses.2015: doy el salto a otra agencia, esta vez con un gran cliente (enorme, m√°s bien), pero me pagan una miseria. Paso un a√±o dur√≠simo a nivel econ√≥mico, aunque aprendo una barbaridad. Me adapto al pa√≠s, comienzo a hacer amigos.2016: doy el salto a una multinacional, esta vez con un sueldo digno. Me ascienden antes de cumplir el a√±o y me convierto en l√≠der de √°rea. Doy un salto a nivel econ√≥mico y de responsabilidad. Ya estoy plenamente adaptado.2018: rechazo una gran oferta para ser l√≠der regional de otra multinacional. Decido volver a Europa. Me despido de grandes amigos, es duro. Me voy directo a Escocia. Empiezo en un trabajo random de subtitulado de videojuegos. Me pagan poco y es inestable. Me cuesta encontrar otro trabajo, pero lo logro y termino en otra agencia.2019: el trabajo no es lo que esperaba y me voy de Glasgow. Viajo a Espa√±a, comienzo en el mundo freelance. Intento montar una agencia con otros profesionales, pero no sale bien.2020: sigo como freelance, pero ahora contratan mis servicios grandes marcas. Lo hago todo a la sombra, sin firmar nada, sin crear mi marca personal.2022: despierto del letargo. Comienzo a desarrollar mi marca, mi m√©todo, y empiezo a formar a otras personas con todo lo que he aprendido como copy y como profesional. Consigo el tan ansiado equilibrio dinero-trabajo-tiempo libre.2023: contin√∫o con mi estrategia. Gane, pierda, tenga pereza o haga fr√≠o. En 9 meses doblo mi cantidad de seguidores y consigo 2 MM de impresiones. Lanzo mi newsletter y comparto contenido a diario. Sigo aprendiendo, ense√±ando y conectando.

Let√≠cia Tainara Souza,6,3 comments,,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, hist√≥rico de tend√™ncias e evolu√ß√µes, aqui v√£o algumas das tend√™ncias de marketing para 2023:ü§≥üèª Marketing de influ√™ncia: o marketing de influ√™ncia chegou pra ficar e continuar√° a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conte√∫do para alcan√ßar p√∫blicos espec√≠ficos (√ì a base da Virginia a√≠, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).üéÅ Personaliza√ß√£o: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experi√™ncia personalizada e relevante, e as empresas est√£o investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estrat√©gias para atender a essa demanda.üìº V√≠deo marketing: o v√≠deo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produ√ß√£o de v√≠deo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Ent√£o investe nisso. A era dos est√°ticos morreu).üîä Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas est√£o come√ßando a adotar estrat√©gias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personaliza√ß√£o tamb√©m).üì© Marketing de conte√∫do: este continuar√° a desempenhando um papel importante na constru√ß√£o de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisar√£o investir em conte√∫do de alta qualidade e em estrat√©gias de distribui√ß√£o para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.üéØ Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experi√™ncia perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estrat√©gias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor est√° em todos os canais e √© inteligente pensar em estrat√©gias adaptadas em cada um deles.üé≤ Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas est√£o cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estrat√©gias de an√°lise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).ü§ñB√îNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estrat√©gias e materiais publicit√°rios tamb√©m √© algo que n√£o tem volta - e que bom! Se voc√™ √© um profissional da √°rea, sugiro come√ßar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estrat√©gias e tomadas de decis√£o. Pois como diz a famosa m√∫sica de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por a√≠, ""hoje √© um novo dia, de um novo tempo que come√ßou. Todos os nossos sonhos, ser√£o verdade e o futuro j√° come√ßou"".#marketing#tecnologia#amazon#empresas#salesforce#marketingsensorial#marketing2023#marketingderelacionamento",2 hours ago

Rick Watson,71,49 comments,3 reposts,"5 Scary Things I Learned While Shopping Amazon Buy With PrimeI've been surprised so many people talking about Buy With Prime, but few of them actually have even ever looked at it, much less purchased from a seller with it.  I decided to remedy that.To make it easy on Amazon, and perhaps prove a point, I decided to throw them a softball.  Let's purchase from their case study accounts.  Here's what I learned.  In the comments, I have the full report and a link to signup to my newsletter which will release it this morning.  (So signup to get future content like this!)Note when I say all their sellers  I mean all their case study sellers.1 - All their sellers are using FBA vs their white-label MCF shipping.This means the packaging is bad, undifferentiated, and worse than any typical premium D2C experience.2 - All their sellers are using Shopify.If you wonder why Amazon needs to sign a deal with Shopify, look no further.  In the sweet-spot of D2C small and medium businesses that Buy With Prime could help, anecdotally I find like 90% of these people are using Shopify.So yeah, Amazon must get a deal done.3 - Buyers need to agree to Amazon's privacy policyThis is not just about fast delivery, then.  (Which was fantastic!) This is about data-sharing.I doubt this would even work in Europe.4 - I never got a branded e-mail from a Shopify store.When I was contacted during the purchase experience, they were all from either Amazon itself, or ""Amazon Pay"" (to be honest, I am not sure why there is a difference the consumer should see).Only one brand in all my purchases sent me a single email before I got the item, and it was to tell me they had created an account for me, and to reset my password for it.Thanks for nothing?5 - Returns were hard.  Like super-hard.Both Amazon customer service and the D2C brands I purchased from could barely find these orders in their database, much less tell me how to return them successfully.I did not feel like I had an ""A to Z Guarantee.""Suffice to say, if I were a buyer of a brand, there is zero advantage to buying with Buy With Prime for the same item that could be on Amazon.  In fact, if the item is already on Amazon, Buy With Prime on a D2C website adds significant friction.If the item is not on Amazon, then you lose the ease of your typical D2C experience.üëáüëáWant more?
