Nit Patel,8,,,"Exciting news in the world of autonomous vehicles!  Did you know that there are six levels of autonomy for self-driving cars? ü§î‚úî Level 0: No automationThe driver is in full control of the vehicle, with no assistance from any automated systems.‚úîLevel 1: Driver assistanceThis level of automation provides some driver assistance, such as cruise control, lane departure warnings, and automatic braking. However, the driver is still responsible for controlling the vehicle.‚úîLevel 2: Partial automationAt this level, the vehicle can assist with both steering and acceleration/deceleration, but the driver must still be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle at any time. Examples of Level 2 automation include Tesla's Autopilot and GM's Super Cruise.‚úîLevel 3: Conditional automationIn Level 3, the vehicle can take full control in certain situations, such as on the highway. However, the driver must still be ready to take control when prompted by the system. Currently, there are no Level 3 vehicles available for sale to the public.‚úîLevel 4: High automationAt this level, the vehicle is capable of performing all driving tasks under certain conditions and does not require any human input. However, Level 4 vehicles are still limited to certain environments or scenarios, such as a self-driving taxi in a designated area or a delivery vehicle on a specific route.‚úîLevel 5: Full automationLevel 5 is the highest level of automation, where the vehicle is capable of performing all driving tasks under any conditions, without any human input. This level of automation would allow for completely autonomous transportation without the need for a human driver.With advancements in technology, we're getting closer and closer to Level 5 autonomy.

Musk emphasized the importance of integrating solar energy into homes and buildings, and the company is planning to offer a complete solar energy package that includes solar panels, battery storage, and electric car charging.In addition, Tesla is working on developing a fleet of autonomous ""robotaxis"", which Musk believes could eventually replace traditional ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. This is an ambitious goal, but Tesla has already made significant progress in autonomous driving technology with its Autopilot feature.His ambition is to be building 20m cars a year and his way of integrating the design of factories and cars together is a novel way forward.If you would like to check out the vision for your business get in touch for a complimentary initial review.#Tesla#MasterPlan3#sustainableenergy#electriccars#autonomousdriving#solarpowerhttps://lnkd.in/eVzjHZjw",2 days ago

From Siri to Tesla Autopilot, Grammarly to Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant to ChatGPT, we're living in a world where AI technology is rapidly evolving and becoming more integrated into our daily lives.As we speak, the conversation around AI is heating up across several industries, including digital marketing, design, writing, psychology, education, and tech. And why shouldn't it? The possibilities of AI are endless and can transform the way we work and live.AI technologies have already started to change the way we create content. For example, have you heard of Descript? It's a tool that can transcribe and analyse audio and video content, making editing a breeze. And let's not forget about Canva, which uses machine learning to make personalized design recommendations and is beta-testing Magic Write in their platform. And for those of us in the video editing space, Wav2Lip generates realistic lip-syncing audio for our videos.But AI's impact doesn't stop there. Runway ML can generate or manipulate images, video, and sound using cutting-edge machine learning models.Now, I know some of you might be worried about the rise of AI and its implications for humanity. However, I want to reassure you that we're not in a Terminator 2-style takeover situation just yet. We must weigh the pros and pitfalls of this new frontier and approach it with caution.So, what do you think about the future of AI and its impact on creativity, information, and humanity as a whole?

Charan A,3,,,"Tesla - Dealing with Data! ü§îTesla is primarily known as an electric vehicle and energy company. However, it is also heavily involved in the collection and analysis of data, which plays a crucial role in the development and operation of its products.Tesla's vehicles are equipped with a wide array of sensors that constantly collect data on everything from speed and acceleration to battery usage and internal temperature. This data is then processed and analyzed by Tesla's advanced algorithms, which use machine learning and artificial intelligence to make real-time adjustments to the vehicle's performance and optimize its efficiency.In addition to collecting data from its vehicles, Tesla is also involved in the development of autonomous driving technology, which relies heavily on the collection and analysis of data. Tesla's Autopilot system, for example, uses a combination of cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors to collect data on the vehicle's surroundings, which is then processed and analyzed to make decisions about acceleration, braking, and steering.Beyond its vehicles, Tesla is also involved in the development of energy storage systems, such as its Powerwall and Powerpack products. These systems are designed to collect and store data on energy usage patterns, which can then be used to optimize energy consumption and reduce costs.data collection and analysis play a crucial role in its operations and the development of its products.#data",2 days ago

Christophe Delaurens,0,,,"R√©parer une Tesla co√ªte une fortune?√âvidemment si on regarde une statistique brute, on croit atteindre une v√©rit√© incontestable.Le probl√®me, c¬¥est qu¬¥on peut ainsi raconter n¬¥importe quoi.Par exemple, on compare un mod√®le √©lectrique avec des mod√®les thermiques qui n¬¥ont pas de version √©lectrique. Bilan, en effet, en cas d¬¥accident, la prise en compte de l¬¥impact de la batterie peut avoir un effet inflationniste. Mais c¬¥est normal.Cependant, le co√ªt de la r√©paration n¬¥est pas un probl√®me puisqu'il est pris en charge par les assurances.Donc ce qu¬¥il faut regarder, c¬¥est l¬¥impact de ces r√©parations sur le prix de l¬¥assurance. Et l√† c'est une autre histoire.Pour au moins 3 raisons:1) les teslas sont les voitures les plus s√ªres du monde en cas d¬¥accident. On le voit lors des crash tests.  Elles √©vitent les dommages corporels. Notamment gr√¢ce aux batteries qui renforcent la structure.2) les teslas ont une excellente tenue de route gr√¢ce aussi aux batteries et au centre de gravit√© plus bas, donc moins d¬¥accidents3) les teslas ont aussi moins d'accidents que les autres marques, parce que leur syst√®me de s√©curit√© est tr√®s efficace. Gr√¢ce au logiciel de surveillance qui utilise les fonctionnalit√©s de l¬¥autopilote, la voiture est capable toute seule de prendre en charge des situations d¬¥urgence, de changer seule de trajectoire, d¬¥acc√©l√©rer ou de ralentir violemment pour √©viter l¬¥accident et sans doute pour en r√©duire les cons√©quences.En plus, les voitures √©lectriques sont plus fiables.Toutes ces fonctionnalit√©s font qu¬¥une tesla est sans doute plus ch√®re √† r√©parer mais moins ch√®re √† assurer,  mais est ce plus important qu¬¥√©viter la mort des conducteurs.

Tech On Wheels,1,,,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States has launched an investigation into Tesla‚Äôs Model Y SUV after two complaints were made regarding the steering wheels coming off while driving. The probe will cover an estimated 120,000 vehicles from the 2023 model year. The NHTSA stated that both incidents happened while the SUVs had low mileage, and in both cases, the Model Ys were delivered with a missing bolt that holds the wheel to the steering column.

To activate Autopilot, pull down on the right stalk on the steering wheel twice.When Autopilot is engaged, your vehicle will automatically maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and stay within its lane. However, it is important to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and pay attention to the road. Autopilot is not a substitute for attentive driving.Charging Your VehicleTo charge your Tesla Model 3, simply plug it into a Tesla Supercharger or a Tesla Wall Connector. You can also charge your vehicle using a standard 120V/240V household outlet, although this method will take longer.When your vehicle is charging, you can monitor its progress using the Tesla mobile app. You can also schedule#tesla",6 days ago

Benny Huang,38,,1 repost,"Recently, I've taken more time to think about the reasons why I began my journey into coding. A lot of it has to do with my interest in technology, but it was also because of my time working at Tesla. I worked on the Autopilot team as a Data Labeler, where my day-to-day work consisted of contributing labeled images that would be used to train the Autopilot system.It was my first time experiencing how amazing technology can be when it's powered by machine-learning algorithms. I was fascinated by the idea of creating intelligent systems that can analyze and interpret data in order to make accurate predictions and decisions. Seeing the Autopilot system in action, and knowing that my labeled images contributed to its development, was a truly rewarding experience. It sparked my interest in machine learning and inspired me to pursue further knowledge in this field.So toward the end of 2021, I decided to apply to Hack Reactor, where I learned how to create full-stack applications and understand the basic fundamentals of programming.But now...I'm interested in starting my journey to learn machine learning and would love some guidance from those who are already experienced in the field.

Adam Qureshi,1,,,"AUTOPILOT 4.0. BETTER. FASTER. AI. Maybe?Based on Tesla's past hardware improvements, it's likely that Autopilot hardware 4.0 will feature a significant boost in processing power and memory to enable more advanced autonomous driving capabilities. This could be achieved through the use of a new, more powerful processor or a combination of multiple processors working in parallel.Tesla may also upgrade the cameras and sensors used for Autopilot to improve object detection and tracking, as well as to enhance the system's ability to perceive the environment in greater detail. Additionally, it's possible that Tesla may incorporate lidar sensors into Autopilot hardware 4.0, which could provide a more accurate and comprehensive view of the vehicle's surroundings.Another area where Tesla could make improvements is in the use of machine learning algorithms. Autopilot 4.0 could potentially feature more advanced and sophisticated algorithms that can learn from driving data and improve the system's ability to predict and react to different driving scenarios.Overall, Autopilot hardware 4.0 is likely to represent a significant improvement over previous versions, enabling more advanced autonomous driving capabilities and providing a more seamless and intuitive driving experience. However, it's important to note that autonomous driving technology is still in the early stages of development, and it may be some time before fully self-driving vehicles become a reality.#tesla#ai",1 week ago

Rajesh Gopinath Kumar,0,,,"Tesla currently offers several optional features that customers can purchase for their vehicles, such as autopilot, full self-driving capability, and premium connectivity. While these features can provide significant benefits to some customers, they may not be necessary or desirable for all.Enabling ""pay per use"" for these features could potentially expand Tesla's testing base, as more customers would be willing to try them out without committing to purchasing them outright. This could provide valuable data and feedback for Tesla to improve and refine these features.However, there are some potential challenges and drawbacks to implementing a ""pay per use"" model for Tesla's features. For example, it could be difficult to accurately measure usage and bill customers accordingly. It could also lead to confusion and dissatisfaction if customers are not fully aware of the costs and limitations of using these features on a pay-per-use basis.Additionally, implementing this model could be seen as a departure from Tesla's current approach of offering these features as optional upgrades at a fixed price. It may also be seen as a cash grab or a way to nickel-and-dime customers, which could damage Tesla's reputation and customer loyalty.W#datahile there are potential benefits to implementing a pay-per-use model for Tesla's features, it would require careful consideration and planning to ensure that it is implemented in a fair and transparent way that benefits both Tesla and its customers.",1 week ago

Joe Olivares,3,1 comment,,"As someone in the insurance industry and a proud owner of a Tesla, I found the recently shared stats on FSD Beta's safety quite interesting. It's impressive that the system experienced an airbag-deployed crash about every 3.2 million miles in the last 12 months, making it about five times safer than the most recently available US average of 600,000 miles per police-reported crash.However, it's important to note that FSD Beta specifically works for inner-city streets, which involve many edge cases and unpredictable driving behaviors from other vehicles. As such, its safety stats are not as impressive as Autopilot's recent results, which recorded one crash for every 6.26 million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot.Despite the controversy surrounding FSD Beta, its adoption is increasing at a steady pace.

Matthias Heller,73,6 comments,1 repost,"Does Tesla have a competitive advantage against other car companies through its active learning pipeline?Tesla's Autopilot uses active learning to improve the system based on what their customer's cars see on the road. By using active learning, the Autopilot system can continually improve its decision-making capabilities and become more accurate over time. Why do I think this could be a competitive advantage:üöó Tesla has roughly 750,000 cars with 8 surround cameras that likely drive about an hour per day on average.üíæ That's about 170 million hours of video per month across the eight cameras on each vehicle.üìà They collect valuable metainformation including the disagreement between ML models and driver (called shadowing)Many other companies don't have access to such a data pool because their production cars are not connected to the ML pipeline and have limited compute for ML. Some companies only have between 20-1000 data collection vehicles. That's not all:‚õè  Tesla can mine interesting data points from the fleetüíª  Tesla can use the customers' car as storage and compute‚òÅ ¬†Tesla can update their Autopilot over the airFrom my experience, the successful deployment of ML models in production relies heavily on the availability of representative training data; Tesla appears to have an advantage in obtaining such data.What do you think?

Philip Bateman,4,,,"""Full self driving will never happen"" - ""Teslaare <_____>"" - ""It's decades away"" - insert additional comments from armchair LinkedIn user with no stake in the game or expertise in the domain ad nauseum.  So anyway, at 1 hour 38 minutes in the 2023 Tesla investor day they get stuck into things =Crash wise, the US average is half a million miles per incident, Tesla are averaging 3.2 million per incident using the Full Self Driving beta.They currently have 14,000 GPUs (graphics processing units) split between 4,000 for auto-labelling everything the fleet are seeing (car drives down street, sees object, needs to know what that object is, gives it a label based on visual recognition software, eg tree, sign post, cat), and 10,000 for training the cars on that data.Each day they are looking at 500,000 videos in the training bank, which is 1.44billion visual frames of information, and they have a completely virtualised world with vehicles and weather patterns, running in the background that the cars are driving themselves around in.As the cars aren't actually 'cars' in the traditional sense, they are mobile computers acting as nodes in a network, that blends the back-end infrastructure of servers, AI, mapping and analytics with their rolling intelligence, they can do things such as the image that shows you 'predictive air suspension'.This is where the fleet of vehicles act as a hive mind, with an individual cars inertial sensors detecting rough road, the autopilot computers GPS and localiser figures out where the vehicle is in the world, then the navigation server anonymously aggregates this data and creates a real time map.As your vehicle is approaching rough road, the on board computers automatically adjust the suspension stiffness to account for it, and then go back to standard settings. More so, because they can ship software updates to cars (and do, regularly) over the air, they first installed this on thousands of vehicles, and let it run in software only mode, meaning it sent back to the servers each time it would or wouldn't have adjusted the suspension, for tens of thousands of miles of real world driving, before they turned it actively on.You'll notice the first slide is two robots working on a third. These walk around now, and are using hand tools. And they are controlled by the same software that runs the cars.Because the cars aren't cars. And the robots aren't robots. They are nodes in a massive network. Like you and I, are as we walk around with our phones, plugged into this evolving digital world.Cool huh?#tesla#autonomy#fullselfdriving#ai#software#automotive",1 week ago

Stephen Savage,31,2 comments,3 reposts,"Have you been looking for Meta's advantage + campaign equivalent on TikTok?Well, it may finally be here.TikTok has recently rolled out a brand new campaign type called Smart Performance campaigns (SPC campaigns for short). It's my belief that this is in direct response to Meta's widespread rollout of Advantage + shopping campaigns that have revolutionized the way that media buyers are advertising on Meta.So what are SPC campaigns and why do you need to be testing them?SPC campaigns are TikToks first end-to-end automation solution that leverages machine learning to optimize for best performance and marketing goals. This campaign type gives advertisers the least amount of control over their campaigns/audiences and hands the wheel over to the TikTok algorithm (similar to Tesla's new autopilot mode).How do these new features translate in-engine?Through initial test, we have seen some SPC campaigns outperform our control group ROAS by a margin of 112%, but we have also seen them be outperformed by control groups as well.Why are some SPC campaigns scaling accounts to efficiencies we have been unable to reach prior and others being less efficient than our BAU campaigns?The simple answer seems to be Spark ads. We know spark ads outperform in-feed ads in general, but see this margin heightened when used in SPC campaigns.Are SPC campaigns going to make TikTok a more competitive platform since it's eliminating learning barriers for new advertisers?Maybe, but one barrier will always stand, separating the top 1%  of advertisers from the rest.

Mehul Sachdeva,6,,,"Human Oversight in an era of#businessautomation- How are we challenging the way#autonomyaffects success and growth while also preaching cultural#inclusivityand personal identity?As technology continues to advance at an exponential rate, the world of business is experiencing a generational shift. With the rise of#aipowered automation, it's becoming easier than ever to streamline complex processes, reduce overhead costs, and increase employee productivity. However, as we become increasingly reliant on these technologies, the question of business autonomy becomes increasingly important.As humans, we're naturally drawn to#efficiencyand#convenience, and AI and automation certainly provide both. But at what cost? Are we becoming too dependent on technology, to the point where it's controlling us instead of the other way around?This is where the concept of business autonomy comes into play.In a world of constant technological advancements, it's crucial for businesses to maintain control over their own operations and decision-making processes. While AI and automation can certainly provide valuable insights and support, they should never be a replacement for human decision-making.Recent events have highlighted the importance of business autonomy. From the#teslaAutopilot crashes to the#boeing737maxcontroversy, we've seen the potential dangers of over reliance on technology. These events demonstrate the need for businesses to prioritize human oversight and decision-making in order to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.So, what can businesses do to maintain autonomy in a world of automation?One key strategy is to focus on hiring and training employees who are skilled in both technology and critical thinking. By empowering employees to make informed decisions and take ownership of their work, businesses can ensure that they remain in control of their own operations. By#empoweringemployees to take ownership of their work, businesses can ensure that they remain in control of their own operations.In conclusion, while automation certainly has its benefits, by prioritizing human oversight and critical thinking, businesses can reap the benefits of technology while avoiding the potential pitfalls of overreliance.Let's work together to build a world where technology works for us, not the other way around.#automation#ai#criticalthinking#humanitarian",1 week ago

LEON FAMILY OFFICE,16,,1 repost,"‚ÄúNext generation Tesla‚Äù has not arrived yet.Highlights from Tesla Investor Day 2023:While investors were waiting for a new master plan for the company and the presentation of a new generation car from Elon Musk, Tesla shares went up sharply. ¬†Since the beginning of 2023, TSLA stock has risen by more than 50%.The wait ended in disappointment yesterday. Investors listened to a 4-hour presentation and talk about how Tesla will transition to sustainable energy, about new plants in Mexico and Arizona (which is actually not bad), but they don‚Äôt have any prototype of a new electric car or a breakthrough platform to show.We remind you that the TSLA super-bulls case is a platform that will sell all kinds of subscriptions and services to the TSLA owner. Here Elon invited the audience to take his word for it. As a result, the share price fell by 5.7% after the market closed.LEON's opinion:The value of Tesla shares is a unique case that depends on Elon Musk's ‚Äúfactor‚Äù, as what he says/does publicly affects Tesla shares in a drastic way.Still, considering the current share price around $195, we have reached a business valuation range for Tesla:¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúTesla will be like Porsche‚Äù: $150 per share is TSLA‚Äôs valuation as a premium car manufacturer.¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúTesla will be like Apple‚Äù: the company could be worth $200 per share if Musk‚Äôs promises about an ecosystem of services, subscription autopilots, robot taxis, etc. come true.Therefore, in our opinion, Tesla shares can be bought at levels of around $120 and below, with profit taking in the range of $150-$200.#tesla#stocks#estimates#portfolioconstruction#energy#electricalvehicle#sustainable",1 week ago

He died when his Tesla with Autopilot activated crashed into a crossing tractor trailer. Mr. Banner‚Äôs death wasn‚Äôt the first involving Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot, but it occurred almost 3 years after Joshua Brown‚Äôs in Florida, in nearly identical conditions (see the below crash scene drawings). It happened one year after Apple Engineer, Walter Huang‚Äôs fatal crash, also due to Autopilot failure on US 101 in California.This death could‚Äôve been prevented, the NTSB investigation and report into Joshua Brown‚Äôs 2016 fatal crash laid out in details what caused the crash and proposed recommendations for Tesla and other Level 2 OEMs, and the USDOT. If it turns out that Autopilot or FSD was activated in last week‚Äôs fatal crash in California involving a Tesla plowing into a fire truck; the NTSB‚Äôs recommendations would‚Äôve gone unheeded for 6 years.What more? In his concurring opinion, NTSB member, Chris Hart added some poignant comments that are as relevant today as they were then, namely:- ‚ÄúAutomation in cars offers significant potential to save tens of thousands of lives everyday by eventually replacing the driver(jury is still out on that claim in my view)‚Ä¶ introducing automation into such a complex and unstructured environment will be very challenging and must be pursued thoughtfully and with considerable caution.‚Äù- He drew comparisons to the early days of aviation automation when the industry adopted automation simply because it had acquired the technological capability to do so. ‚ÄúBecause we can‚Äù automation doesn‚Äôt improve the human-automation system.- The human element must be adequately considered. Monitoring driver engagement in the driving task is paramount for advanced driver assistance systems.- The moniker ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù may convey a false sense of security and cause drivers to not pay attention to the driving task.Tesla basically ignored the NTSB‚Äôs recommendations, so didNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA(at least until the recent standing order on crash reporting) and the USDOT. Several more fatal crashes involving Autopilot have occurred since 2019, nearly 2 dozens by some accounts. Tesla introduced an even more confusing feature known as ‚ÄúFull Self Driving‚Äù or ‚ÄúFSD Beta‚Äù, which Tesla charges $15,000 for and told investors on Monday was a Level 2 system (definitely not full self driving).Philip KoopmanMichael DeKortDavid B.Tom Dahlstr√∂mJos√©-Luis Preza D√≠azJeffrey DeCouxMasheika AllgoodNTSB‚Äôs investigation into Joshua Brown‚Äôs fatal crash:https://lnkd.in/e_qgRKF2NTSB‚Äôs investigation into Jeremy Banner‚Äôs fatal crash:https://lnkd.in/ekqjqNwV#automation#tesla#safety#selfdrivingcars#autonomousvehicles#selfdriving#autonomousdriving#mobility#mobilityasaservice#transportationsafety#trafficsafety#adas#ads#connectedvehicles#teslaautopilot#teslamodelx#teslamodel3",1 week ago

CS Nagesh Rudrakanthwar,37,,1 repost,"Class Action suits and derivative actions originated in the US and have now become a predominant and integral part of its corporation laws.Recently one more class action lawsuit has been filed against Tesla, its CEO Elon Musk, and other executives at San Francisco federal court, alleging that the company overstated the success and safety of its Full Self-Driving Autopilot software, despite the severe risks of accidents and injuries.The lawsuit has been brought by an investor who claims that Tesla and its executives misled investors about the technology's capabilities, causing significant losses and damages to shareholders.It also follows a recent recall of nearly 363,000 vehicles and increased regulatory scrutiny of the Autopilot system.This is not the first time Elon Musk confronted class action suits in the past, to name some of it a securities fraud class action in 2018, which was settled for $40 million and caused Elon Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla's board for three years.In another instance, a labour law class action was filed against Tesla in 2020, which alleged that the company violated California labour laws.The rise in class action suits in the US signifies the increasing shareholder activism. The past few class action suits indicate that Shareholders expect more transparency and fairness from corporations. In some instances, the expectations go beyond the regulatory requirements.#law#classaction#us#generalcounsel#lawyers#companylaw#legalcounsel#legal#companysecretary",2 weeks ago

Code6,0,,,"Tesla pauses rollout of Full Self&Driving beta software.Tesla paused the rollout of its Full Self-Driving beta software in the United States and Canada following a recall of the system that federal safety regulators warned¬†could allow vehicles to act unsafe around intersections and cause crashes.Tesla said in a new company support page that new or pending installations of FSD beta software ‚Äî an advanced driver assistance system that costs $15,000 ‚Äî will be halted until it issues an over-the-air software update that corrects the issue. The software update is free.‚ÄúUntil the software version containing the fix is available, we have paused the rollout of FSD Beta to all who have opted-in but have not yet received a software version containing FSD Beta,‚Äù the company wrote on the support page.Earlier this month,¬†Tesla said¬†it was recalling certain 2016‚Äì2023 Model S and Model X vehicles; 2017‚Äì2023 Model 3 vehicles; and 2020‚Äì2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software or those pending installation. The recall, which was posted¬†on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration‚Äôs website, affects as many as 362,758 vehicles equipped with the software, according to the notice.This recall affects only U.S. and Canada vehicles. Affected vehicles were identified based on vehicle manufacturing, configuration, and software records.Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver-assistance system branded as Autopilot. For an¬†additional $15,000, owners can buy ‚Äúfull self-driving,‚Äù or FSD ‚Äî a feature that CEO¬†Elon Musk¬†has promised for years will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. Tesla vehicles¬†are not self-driving.Instead, FSD includes a number of automated driving features that still require the driver to be ready to take control at all times. It includes the parking feature Summon, as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes. The system is also supposed to handle steering on city streets and recognize and react to traffic lights and stop signs.Notably, the company support page acknowledges that the system in certain rare circumstances could potentially infringe upon local traffic laws or customs while executing these driving maneuvers in specific conditions before the driver may intervene.Tesla also describes FSD as a Level 2 system on the support page, a designation that while obvious may come as a disappointment to shareholders and owners who support Musk‚Äôs belief that the vehicles will be ‚Äúself driving.‚ÄùThere are five levels of automation under standards created by SAE International. Level 2 means two primary functions ‚Äî like adaptive cruise and lane keeping ‚Äî are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times.Tesla pauses rollout of Full Self-Driving beta software by Kirsten Korosec originally published on TechCrunchhttps://lnkd.in/dFmysPrA",2 weeks ago

Harald M. Depta,0,,,"In der vergangenen Woche machte die Nachricht von einem R√ºckruf der Beta-Software#FSDf√ºr das Autopilot-System von#Tesladie Runde. CEO Elon Musk wies jedoch darauf hin, dass es sich hierbei nicht um einen R√ºckruf im eigentlichen Sinne handle.Dennoch bezeichneten sowohl die Verkehrsbeh√∂rde NHTSA als auch Tesla selbst die Aktion als solchen. Ein neues Support-Dokument zeigt nun, dass vorerst keine neuen Kunden die Beta-#Softwareerhalten werden.FSD steht f√ºr Full Self-Driving und bezeichnet sowohl die Option, die man in den#USAf√ºr 15.000 Dollar kaufen kann, als auch die Software selbst. Obwohl es nach autonomem Fahren klingt, ist dies im Kleingedruckten bei der Bestellung und bei der Aktivierung deutlich gemacht: FSD ist keineswegs so zu verstehen. Die#NHTSAforderte Ende Januar einen R√ºckruf der Beta-Software, da sie in bestimmten Situationen das#Unfallrisikoerh√∂he. Tesla teilte diese Einsch√§tzung nicht, entschied sich aber zu einem freiwilligen R√ºckruf.Betroffen sind potenziell 362.758 Fahrzeuge von Model 3 bis Model X aus den Jahren 2016 bis 2023, bei denen es sich um alle in den USA handeln d√ºrfte, deren K√§ufer die FSD-Option dazugew√§hlt haben. Der Beta-Test begann im Oktober 2020 mit einem kleinen Kreis und wurde langsam erweitert.Im November 2022 k√ºndigte CEO Musk an, dass ab sofort alle Tesla-Fahrzeuge mit FSD-Option in Nordamerika daran teilnehmen k√∂nnten. Im Gesch√§ftsbericht f√ºr das vierte Quartal 2022 wurde diese Zahl dann mit rund 400.000 in den USA und Kanada angegeben.Gem√§√ü des R√ºckruf-Dokuments hat Tesla die Verbreitung von FSD Beta an alle pausiert, die sich angemeldet, aber noch keine Software-Version mit FSD Beta erhalten haben. Es ist jedoch unklar, welchen Anteil der genannten 400.000 Kunden das ausmacht und wann die#Verbreitungwieder aufgenommen wird. In der R√ºckruf-Mitteilung wurde jedoch angek√ºndigt, dass in den kommenden Wochen ein#Updatef√ºr die Beta-Software verbreitet werden soll, das das Verhalten in problematischen Situationen verbessert. Dies d√ºrfte auch f√ºr den Neustart der FSD-Verbreitung an zus√§tzliche Kunden gelten.Tesla-Besitzer mit bezahlter#Optionund angemeldeter Test-Teilnahme m√ºssen daher vorerst warten, bevor sie aufgenommen werden k√∂nnen. Das bedeutet auch, dass vorerst keine neu gekauften#Elektroautosvon Tesla die Beta-Software erhalten k√∂nnen. Im Umkehrschluss best√§tigen die ver√∂ffentlichten Hinweise jedoch, dass FSD bis zum Vorliegen des Updates nicht deaktiviert wird, wenn es bereits vor dem R√ºckruf installiert war. Eine weitere Ausweitung des Beta-Tests in den USA ist jedoch vorerst unterbunden. Bisherige Teilnehmer erhalten erst dann wieder eine neue Version von FSD, wenn sie die von der Beh√∂rde geforderten Verbesserungen enth√§lt.#emobilit√§t#unternehmen#assistenz#probleme#elektroauto",2 weeks ago
"Ivan Prock, P.Eng., BEng, MS",1,,,"See the article for the tweets w/ more details.#Tesla#Model2#InvestorDaySpeculation#PierreFerragu#NewStreetResearch""As noted by New Street Research Managing Partner¬†Pierre Ferragu, the ‚ÄúModel 2‚Äù is a critical component of Tesla‚Äôs continued success. And while details about the vehicle will likely be discussed on Investor Day, the Wall Street veteran shared some tidbits about what New Street expects from the vehicle.First off, Ferragu estimated that the upcoming vehicle would be about 15% shorter, 30% lighter, and have a battery that‚Äôs¬†25% smaller than the pack installed on the Model 3. The analyst explained how New Street Research was able to come up with its estimates. ‚ÄúWe looked at how ICE compacts compare to mid-size ICE sedans and extrapolated the comparison between Model 3 and ICE mid-size sedans to reach this conclusion,‚Äù Ferragu wrote on Twitter.Apart from this, New Street Research expects the ‚ÄúModel 2‚Äù to be about 37% less expensive to build compared to the Model 3. Half of these cost savings would likely be due to the car‚Äôs smaller size, while the other half would likely be due to¬†design, architecture, and manufacturing innovations. Elon Musk, for his part, has mentioned in the past that with its next-generation platform, Tesla would aim to make two cars for the same effort it takes to produce one Model 3 today.Considering the advantages inherent in Teslas, such as FSD/Autopilot, superior range and performance, as well as the Supercharger Network, Ferragu noted that the ‚ÄúModel 2‚Äù would likely command a premium over vehicles like the Toyota Corolla, similar to how the Model 3 commands a premium over a Honda Accord. Despite this, the ‚ÄúModel 2‚Äù would likely be competitive. This was certainly the case last year wth the Model 3 and Model Y, both of which performed well despite their steep prices.That being said, the analyst noted that Tesla might be able to maintain a gross margin heading towards 30% for vehicles, even with a smaller, more affordable vehicle in the mix. And considering its expected price of $25K MSRP, the upcoming affordable electric car would effectively address about 80% of the auto market. With this, Ferragu noted that the vehicle could ultimately pave the way for Tesla to exceed 12 million units in 2030. This is optimistic considering Tesla‚Äôs volumes today, though it should be noted that the EV maker is looking to achieve an output of 20 million vehicles per year by the end of the decade.""",2 weeks ago

Coen Hooijer,100,18 comments,3 reposts,"Met je Tesla op skivakantie naar Oostenrijk of Frankrijk? Negeer de Tesla laadstop suggesties!Vuistregel: Range anxiety bestaat niet.De Tesla navigatie zal je zo ‚Äòveilig‚Äô mogelijk een route voorstellen tot de eerstvolgende Supercharger maar je kunt jouw Tesla tijdens een lange rit het beste leegrijden tot ergens tussen de 0-10%. Je hebt in een Model 3 of Y namelijk op 0% nog steeds 4 kWh bruikbaar, dat is nog zo‚Äôn 20 km resterend. BijMisterGreen | Netherlandsrijden we het liefste tot 0%, elk procent extra is eigenlijk te veel. Maak je geen zorgen met een lege batterij stil te vallen, want om je batterij leeg te rijden moet je wel echt je best doen.Vaak zal de Tesla bij vertrek vanuit de Randstad met 85-100% je eerst naar Duiven of Hengelo sturen, bij aankomst in Duiven heb je dan nog zo‚Äôn 65% of in Hengelo meestal nog zo‚Äôn 25-40% lading over. Je kunt dan beter doorrijden naar Oberhausen of Hilden. Dit zijn allereerst veel mooiere locaties, hebben veel meer stalls (laadplekken) en een betere lounge/shop beschikbaar. Hoe meer stalls, hoe kleiner de kans op lange wachttijden bij de Supercharger. Hier heb je met 15 max 20 minuten je auto tot 80% bijgeladen om je weg te vervolgen. Het is raadzaam om nooit meer dan 80% te laden want er zijn voldoende Superchargers beschikbaar en het duurt aanzienlijk langer om van 80-100 % dan van 10-80% te laden.De Tesla Superchargers bij Oberhausen en Hilden zijn mooie locaties om op te laden op weg naar je wintersportbestemming. In Oberhausen kun je even los op de driving range of sport kijken op het gigantische scherm.Houd rekening met rijden in Duitsland (130-190 km/h) dat je ongeveer 100 km minder kunt rijden dan je navigatie aangeeft. Hoe lager je snelheid, hoe meer rijbereik. Als jouw volgende supercharger 220 km verderop ligt dan kun je wegrijden met 320 km op de navigatie, je Tesla zal tijdens het laden aangeven dat je met te weinig batterij aankomt maar tijdens het rijden loopt dit percentage langzaam op. Bovendien zijn er in Duitsland regelmatig wegwerkzaamheden waar je 80-100 km/h rijdt, dit heeft gunstige invloed op je range.Het loont altijd om tijdens het rijden even Autopilot in te schakelen en op je scherm te zoeken naar √©√©n Supercharger verder dan Tesla navigatie je voorschotelt, tik hem in en kijk hoeveel % je overhoudt volgens de navigatie. Ook kun je zien hoeveel laadplaatsen er in totaal zijn, hoeveel er beschikbaar zijn en wat de max. laadsnelheid is. Als je een Model 3 of Y rijdt kies dan altijd voor de 250 kW Superchargers.De laatste Superchargers voor je Oostenrijk binnenrijdt zijn in Langkampfen of in F√ºssen, deze is nieuw en zeker een bezoekje waard. Supercharger gemist? Zoek dan een Ionity snellader via je Tesla navigatie maar hou dan rekening met hogere prijzen.#endfossilfuel#tesla#mistergreen#supercharging#norangeanxiety",2 weeks ago

Mart√≠n Levi,1,,,"I recently chatted with ChatGPT and we discussed why Tesla is likely to be the go-to electric vehicle (EV) brand. It's partly due to the company's well-established name, but also because EVs are similar to smartphones in that the operating system is a critical feature. Elon Musk is often compared to a mix of Steve Jobs and Wozniak, which is a nod to his innovative leadership style and technical expertise.What sets Tesla apart is that its operating system, the Tesla Infotainment System, was specifically designed for electric vehicles. The system runs on a customized hardware platform that includes the Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Computer, which is specially built for autonomous driving. It's equipped with two AI chips that can process vast amounts of data from the car's cameras, sensors, and other sources in real-time.What's particularly impressive about the Tesla OS is that it's software-defined, which means that most of the vehicle's features and functions are controlled by software rather than hardware. This allows Tesla to continually update and improve the driving experience for customers, providing new features and improvements over-the-air without requiring a dealership or service center.Tesla's OS is loaded with features, including Autopilot, Full-Self Driving, Caraoke, Bioweapon Defense Mode, virtual Easter eggs, and smart air suspension. Autopilot can automatically steer, accelerate, and brake, while Full-Self Driving can recognize stop lights, stop signs, and even change lanes on the highway. Caraoke is a fun feature that lets you sing karaoke while driving, and Bioweapon Defense Mode protects passengers by filtering out toxic chemicals.In addition, the Tesla OS includes hidden Easter eggs that provide a fun and unique way to interact with your car. The smart air suspension system adjusts the firmness based on GPS coordinates, providing a comfortable ride. Sentry mode allows you to monitor your parked car remotely from anywhere in the world, and Tesla's network of supercharging stations is expanding rapidly worldwide.Overall, Tesla's innovative OS and microchip have enabled a unique set of features that set its vehicles apart in the automotive market. With a powerful microchip and software-defined system, Tesla can continually update and improve its vehicles, moving at a scary pace.#automotive#change#ev#tesla#electricvehicles",2 weeks ago
Michael DeKort,29,9 comments,2 reposts,"Companies oversell the self-driving capabilities of their cars, with horrific¬†outcomesYa think?While it's nice to see the press start to say these things, it's a bit frustrating that most didn't get this from day one and then need an mind-boggling amount of clear evidence to make even the slightest shift. Shame the press can't find a way to break free from echo chambers.Beyond that it's not just Tesla. Every single AV maker is lying, committing fraud and grossly negligent. They either need to harm or kill needless Guinea pigs to learn and test most crash cases. or they have to avoid them an tell the public they are good to go. Most are doing the latter. Hence, Waymo suing California to avoid providing any meaningful performance data. And NONE will provide any meaningful test data.Having said all of this, I think this is the year most find the courage to says what I have been saying for over 5 years. Question is will ANY AV maker CEO's have the courage and selflessness to admit they had the development approach all wrong and fix it? Or will they do as most have done so far? Cash in, spare their egos, say it was just too hard, go bankrupt and screw their employees and families. (Some have gone moved away from L4/5 or went to other use cases to make things easier. But NONE has admitted they had the development approach wrong.)#tesla#elonmusk#driverlesscars#driverlesscars#driverless#autonomousvehicles#selfdrivingcars#autonomous#autonomousdriving#selfdriving#adas#autonomousvehicle#driverlessvehicles#teslamotors#autopilot#autonomouscar#nhtsa#ntsb#AI#machinelearning#waymo#artificialintelligence#machinelearning#deeplearning#waymo",2 weeks ago

Dr. Agus Budiyono,26,,,"ON AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATIONAutonomous or driverless cars are becoming increasingly popular as technology advances, and Tesla is one of the leading companies in this field. Tesla's latest technology for autonomous cars is their Autopilot system, which uses a combination of cameras, sensors, and software to enable the car to drive itself in certain situations.The Autopilot system includes a range of features, including adaptive cruise control, which adjusts the car's speed based on the speed of the vehicle in front, and lane departure warning, which alerts the driver if the car is drifting out of its lane. The system also includes a feature called Navigate on Autopilot, which allows the car to navigate on highways and take exits without the driver's input.One of the most impressive aspects of Tesla's autonomous car technology is its ability to learn and improve over time. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from millions of miles of driving, constantly improving its ability to detect and respond to different situations on the road.However, it's important to note that Tesla's Autopilot system is not fully autonomous and still requires the driver to be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle at any time. Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and remain vigilant while using Autopilot.Overall, Tesla's Autopilot system represents the latest technology for autonomous cars, offering a range of features designed to make driving safer and more efficient. As technology continues to advance, it's likely that we will see more and more autonomous cars on the road, transforming the way we travel and reducing the risk of accidents caused by human error.Source: FSD Beta 10.9 drive by @WholeMarsBlog#driverlesscar#autonomouscar#ArtificialIntelligence#selfdriving#innovation#MachineLearning",2 weeks ago

Michael DeKort,23,,3 reposts,"I hear EU AV Type Cert folks are requesting testing be done in simulation and that it needs to include the perception/sensor system not skip it and go right to the planning system. While this is an excellent development, there is a major issue here.The most important is the simulation products used and created in this industry are gaming technology based. That means they cannot handle proper real-time, especially when loaded. And they cannot facilitate the use of proper sensor models. Those being exact sensor models built with real-world performance curves. Without this modeling transition zones between objects and the environment will be flawed and create development and testing false confidence.If anyone knows who the folks are in this EU group and can connect me to them so we can have a chat on this I would appreciate it.And if any AV maker, simulation company or test organization would like to be the first to do this right, please let me know that as well.How the failed Iranian hostage rescue in 1980 can save the Autonomous Vehicle industryhttps://lnkd.in/dBygd9w#tesla#elonmusk#driverlesscars#driverlesscars#driverless#autonomousvehicles#selfdrivingcars#autonomous#autonomousdriving#selfdriving#adas#autonomousvehicle#driverlessvehicles#teslamotors#autopilot#autonomouscar#nhtsa#ntsb#AI#machinelearning#waymo#artificialintelligence#machinelearning#deeplearning#waymo",2 weeks ago

Baba Mulani,28,,1 repost,"Many EVs come equipped with advanced onboard data systems that provide drivers with real-time information about their battery life, charging status, and the location of charging stations. EV manufacturers also use this data for a variety of purposes. For example, Tesla, one of the leading EV manufacturers, collects data from its vehicles and uses it to improve its Autopilot system. The company has also been able to detect and address issues with its vehicles through data collection. This has resulted in increased safety and improved customer satisfaction.Policymakers can also benefit from onboard electric vehicle data. By analyzing data on driving patterns and charging behavior, policymakers can better understand how to plan for and invest in charging infrastructure. This can help ensure that charging infrastructure is built in the locations where it is most needed and that it is accessible to all EV owners. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the government has used data on EV charging patterns to identify areas where additional charging infrastructure is needed. This has resulted in increased investment in charging infrastructure in areas where it was previously lacking, which has helped to reduce range anxiety and make EV ownership more convenient for consumers.Onboard vehicle data can help policymakers make more informed decisions about the policies and regulations that govern the use of EVs. For instance, data on driving patterns can inform policies that incentivize the use of EVs during times of low electricity demand. This can help reduce strain on the electricity grid and ensure that charging infrastructure is available when it is needed most.Furthermore, EVs can collect new types of data that have the potential to further accelerate the adoption of EVs. For example, many EVs are equipped with sensors that can detect road conditions and weather patterns. This data can be used to create more accurate models of driving behavior and to better predict charging needs.#electricvehicle#data#safety#evpolicy",2 weeks ago
Michael DeKort,30,6 comments,1 repost,"Locomation shutting down operations by month's endJust like when Argo went under, this is a clear sign every trucking AV maker has been headed to bankruptcy from the beginning. Including Aurora, who recently made the shift to trucking to make development easier.Every bit of this is avoidable is the issues below are remedied. I talked to Locomation leadership several times trying to help them. They refused to make their simulation and AV engineers available to talk. This is another case of leadership, who is likley financially sound, choosing their ego over their employees and their families, admitting they had the development approach and simulation wrong and making the necessary changes. (I talked with Stirling Anderson at Aurora as well. He also refused to do the right thing.)- Nascent GL/AGI - which means no inference. Which leads to an untenable pattern recognition workload. (Deep learning). The alternative here is rules based development, not classifying objects or trying to establish their movements. Which this domain cannot do due to the complexity.- Use of human Guinea pigs, many of which have to literally be sacrificed to train/test many crash cases- Relying on the real-world vs simulation for most development and testing- Use of inadequate gaming simulation technology vs that from aerospace(I received a response that Locomation got in trouble due to their leader/follower approach. Yes, that made things worse. However, the fundamental development and sim tech issues are the same across the industry.)#tesla#elonmusk#driverlesscars#driverlesscars#driverless#autonomousvehicles#selfdrivingcars#autonomous#autonomousdriving#selfdriving#adas#autonomousvehicle#driverlessvehicles#teslamotors#autopilot#autonomouscar#nhtsa#ntsb#AI#machinelearning#waymo#artificialintelligence#machinelearning#deeplearning#waymo",2 weeks ago

Raphael Sibille,39,33 comments,1 repost,"I struggle to get my head around just how efficient heat pumps really are. They aren't just a bit better than a boiler. Energy from thin air. It‚Äôs closer to magic.I could replace my ageing boiler with a brand new model. The upgrade might give me an extra 5-15% energy efficiency. New for old, but essentially the same thing.But a new heat pump can be 4 times better than that old boiler. It's in a different league. It's like comparing the fuel efficiency of a family car with a small lorry.Peak heat pump performance comes from driving it carefully. It needs to run gently. It wants to ramp up slowly. It has to be in tune with the building and the weather outside. Drive it like you own it - or better, on autopilot - and it will be hyper-efficient.I've started the process of getting a heat pump. My attention is on the software. The hardware inside many makes and models is usually more or less the same. But the controls & UX can be wildly different.So, tell me.

bitsensing Inc.,26,,1 repost,"Q: Why imaging radar?A: The biggest advantage of radar is that it can be used reliably in all weather and lighting conditions. On the other hand, Cameras and Lidar are very vulnerable in dense fog, snowstorms, bad weather, high exposure, and so on.If we look at the Tesla Autopilot accident in Taiwan in 2020, the Tesla, which was driving straight on a four-lane road, did not detect the overturned truck in front of it. The car was equipped with camera vision and 2D radar, but the camera vision could not distinguish the white coating of the truck from the sky and was not familiar with an overturned truck situation. With that, 2D radar cannot accurately detect height information, so it seems to have identified the truck as an overpass or sign that the vehicle could pass through. In other words, due to the limitations of vision-based judgment and 2D radar object recognition, it appears that the Autopilot system was not mature enough.4D imaging radar can detect the environment in 3D and measure 1D speed information, enabling more precise detection and differentiation of stationary objects that may cause collisions, moving individual objects, and height information. Moreover, 4D imaging radar delivers detection of various situations and related information of the driving environment, such as the remaining distance until a collision. If the Tesla car had been equipped with imaging radar, we could have avoided the accident back in 2020.The fact that Lidar and camera sensors become vulnerable in different environments is also a critical issue. Think about it. Self-driving car demos work well in good weather. However, these sensors are still not commercialized¬†because of the limits in solving edge cases. And this we can overcome with imaging radar.Read more on the interview withbitsensing Inc.CEOJae-Eun Leeand Automotive Electronics magazine.https://lnkd.in/gyB-k9-k#radar#imagingradar#automotive",2 weeks ago
Code6,0,,,"Tesla to build engineering HQ in California.Tesla is making California the home of its global engineering headquarters.CEO Elon Musk and California Governor Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that Tesla‚Äôs new engineering HQ will be at the former offices of Hewlett-Packard.The sudden rekindling of Tesla‚Äôs relationship with California may be surprising after the EV-maker up and moved its corporate headquarters from Fremont, California to Austin, Texas in 2021 after disputes with the state over COVID-19 restrictions. Musk has also repeatedly criticized California for being over-regulated and burdened with high taxes.However, Tesla has maintained operations of its first factory in Fremont, which still houses many engineers.Tesla tweeted that it‚Äôs hiring for new engineering roles in California, which would be a large part of the reason Newsom is backing the EV-maker‚Äôs investment back into the state. Sources told CNBC that the focus will be on engineers proficient in research development and artificial intelligence.‚ÄúCalifornia prides itself on being on the leading and cutting edge of discovery and new ideas and innovation,‚Äù said Newsom, noting the state‚Äôs long relationship with Tesla. Newsom said he was excited to work with Tesla to both transform the automobile industry and reinforce California‚Äôs manufacturing dominance.Musk said the Fremont factory is expected to produce more than 600,000 vehicles this year.Tesla also said Wednesday that it will focus battery cell production in the United States to take advantage of federal incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act.Although Tesla is California‚Äôs most popular automaker, the company has a difficult relationship with the state. Tesla is being investigated by the federal equal employment agency and is still in the middle of a lawsuit from the state‚Äôs Civil Rights Department in regard to complaints from workers that the Fremont factory is rife with racial bias and harassment. The CA Department of Motor Vehicles has also accused Tesla of falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) advanced driver assistance systems.Tesla is expected to go further into details on the announcement on Wednesday during a scheduled livestream event.Tesla to build engineering HQ in California by Rebecca Bellan originally published on TechCrunchhttps://lnkd.in/d5bH3BRF",2 weeks ago

Kiryl Trembovolski,8,,,"Andrej Karpathy, back then in charge of theTeslaAutopilot team, published the Software 2.0 blog post in Nov 2017 - almost six months after ""Attention is all you need"" saw the day of light.The blog post defined two concepts:Software 1.0 - status quo, the code we write, a human engineered product. Python, C++ etc.Software 2.0 - a code written by the optimization based on an evaluation criterion. Basically a neural network. Programming takes a new shape: 1) get good quality training data, a lot of it 2) set the objective and evaluation criteria 3) identify the neural net architecture (or search for it in some loosely defined space).So I read it, I think, in 2018 and ignorantly thought that although his ideas were curious there is no way we will get to Software 2.0 as fast as he was predicting. BERT wasn't there yet and we were all quite happy in the cute and cozy world of Software 1.0 :)Next thing you know... fast-forwarding to 2023 with the latest advances in LLMs, none of his predictions look too out of this world to me.#software2#ai#neuralnetworks",2 weeks ago
