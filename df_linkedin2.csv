CURAZE,0,,,"#CURAZEgoesSXSWüí• Wrap-up Fourth (and last) Day, Monday March 13thüí° The Most Important Takeaways: Today we had our second private speaker:Mary Gray, Senior Principal Researcher atMicrosoftResearch. The trained anthropologist is considered a leading expert on AI and ethics. She sits on numerous committees, including on theStanford University's One-Hundred-Year Study on Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of thinking about the future of artificial intelligence and making recommendations for its policy implications. The topic at breakfast was ‚Äì not surprisingly ‚Äì#ChatGPTand#AI. Of course, we had already heard a lot about this topic at the conference, but with Mary we were able to go deeper into the discussion. Her classification and critical consideration have sharpened our view once again. Her conclusion: With all the huge opportunities that ChatGPT offers, we must develop more awareness and understand that there is a lot at stake here (keywords: data sovereignty, privacy). Unfortunately, what was missed, was to determine the terms of use in advance. In this way, it's like throwing a new drug onto the market untested.On our last day at SXSW there were a few real highlights: Tilda Swinton (10 out of 10 points!), Garry Kasparov, andGinni Romettygave themselves and us the honor. In the evening, New Order held a concert, which we unfortunately missed.‚ùì The Biggest Challenges: saying goodbye ‚Äì from the group, the Austin vibes, and the summer temperatures. We embraced the final moments with a few beers during a last sundowner in the Moonlight Bar.üì£ Quote of the Day: There are two farewells.One by Garry Kasparov: ""I am very optimistic for the future. But men still have the monopoly on evil."" And from the fabulous Mary Gray: ""As soon as we are not biased anymore ‚Äì AI will not be biased"". Love it!üñã Additional: If you can't or don't want to wait a whole year for the next SXSW ‚Äì from the 15th to the 22nd of October there will be an offshoot in Sydney. Kangaroo chronicles, so to speak.üó£ Austin Gossip: All hell breaks loose at the airport because of big departure days say the Uber drivers.

Amirhossein Tohidi,0,,,"Machine learning methods are based on the idea that systems can learn from data and recognize patterns with minimal human intervention. Although machine learning methods provide accurate results for marketing decisions, the use of these methods in marketing studies is still at an early stage. Also, the ability of machine learning methods to consider heterogeneity among consumers has not been proven.Artificial neural networks are able to measure all nonlinear and complex interactions between the variables of the system, unlike discrete choice random utility models. There is no need to specify a mathematical relationship between the input and output variables. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks are known as black-box models, and the lack of interpretability is their weakness.In an article published in the British Food Journal entitled ""Organic food market segmentation based on the neobehavioristic theory of consumer behavior,"" I used four fuzzy and crisp clustering algorithms to segment the organic food market. By performing a sensitivity analysis on the output of the artificial neural network, I analyzed how the explanatory variables influence purchase intentions.We used two other machine learning methods to extract consumer behavior rules in our latest study, which is now ready for submission. From a policy perspective, the results obtained are very interesting and meaningful.Using a distributed artificial intelligence model, our next goal will be to simulate the behavior of artificial agents/consumers.#machinelearning#marketing#consumerbehavior",3 minutes ago

Rohan Korde,0,,,"An asymptotic attempt at answering the biggest question going around...The#chatgpt'movement' has created two sets of opinions. One set cannot wait for it to mimic humanity. The other set is looking to find failure- hack it. Anyhow.The existential question on whether AI could, at a point on the time horizon, replace the day-to-day faculties of the human brain is not a simplistic binary call; it is instead a probability that could perhaps be informed by the#reverse#fibonaccisequenceequation.An illustration of this probability could be a collapsing triad/triangle of intelligence, intellect and wisdom on a Fibonacci spiral with consciousness as the center or origin. Let us assume that intelligence follows intellect follows wisdom follows consciousness (in that order). This is a value chain that ultimately drives consciousness.For definition,#intelligencecan be described as gathered information,#intellectcan be defined as a series of reasoning hypothesis built on top of intelligence. Wisdom on the other hand can be understood as the ability of understand human nature. Human nature can be paradoxical, counterintuitive, counterculture, contradictory or also be conventional), an intersection of the rational and emotional!Thus, while intelligence, at the bottom of the value chain is a machine at work, consciousness is the apex, the stargate to enlightenment.Will AI replace humans?I could choose the reverse fibonacci sequence principle as a safe bet to guesstimate the answer as human brain development follows the fibonacci sequence, growing at a rate dictated by the golden ratio. For AI, therefore, to close the gap between itself and the human brain, the intelligence bubble (illustration attached to this post) has to accelerate on the spiral (shown by the arc) and merge with the intellect bubble, which in turn is also accelerating towards the wisdom bubble. All 3 bubbles then have to eventually collapse into the consciousness core. At least that is how the equation is supposed to play out.At 100 trillion parameters, Chatgpt-4 matches the human brain. But that is capacity. When the chatgpt algorithm runs, 'artificial intellect' is activated, which is pretty much the output we are all getting at the moment from GPT-3 right now, making us go weak in our knees.This is where it gets really, really tough for AI. GPT-X (will call it X as X can hold multiple values) now has to patternize human nature (if at all, with its irrational paradoxes - behavioral variance) in order to come frighteningly close to the human brain. What extent of computing capacity and additional parameters will that take to do is anyone's guess. This is where we hit a bit of a dead wall.So, the short answer to the question is No. Not just yet, unless there is a quantum leap in theoretical understanding that becomes a watershed moment and also humanity's waterloo!#technology#ai#theoritical#pontificate#computing#debate#ramification#ethicalai",10 minutes ago

Jeden Tag taucht in der LinkedIn Timeline dar√ºber etwas auf. Aber nicht nur im Bereich der K√ºnstlichen Intelligenz, auch bei Virtual Reality und Augmented Reality tut sich einiges und so habe ich euch gefragt, wie schnell sich VR oder AR durchsetzen werden oder ob es f√ºr Marketingstrategien relevant werden wird. Laut den Antworten meiner letzten beiden Umfragen kam dabei folgendes zusammen:üöÄ Ihr habt gesagt, dass VR oder AR f√ºr die Marketingstrategie eines Unternehmens teilweise schon von Bedeutung sind, es aber stark auf die Branche ankommt!üöÄ Au√üerdem wart ihr der Meinung, dass Virtual Reality vielleicht in 3-5 Jahren im B√ºroalltag zu finden sein wird. Einige meinten jedoch auch, dass sich das nicht etablieren wird.Gerade im Zusammenhang mit dem stetigen Voranschreiten von Artificial Intelligence, die in vielen Bereichen etabliert wird, wird die Verbindung zwischen realer und virtueller Welt in den kommenden Jahren enger werden.

Rolf van Haren,0,,,"REDUCTIONISM FROM LANGUAGE WITH A TOUCH OF TECHNOLOGYA description leads to a fixed mindset. Or else: If we make a description of ourselves or someone else, it leads us to find it difficult to see beyond the words that are given. This is an aspect of our brain that I call a fixed mindset. To break free from this fixed mindset and to come to new perspectives, there is a lot available on the market: Design Thinking workshops, Lego serious play and many many other fun creative sessions, which make good money but don‚Äôt solve (sorry to say it) a thing on a fundamental level.What is fundamentally not addressed is the way we use words (also in these sessions). As a linguist, I learned how limiting words are, or how they contribute to unlocking potential. Our reality is locked up in words, in descriptions, in beliefs, in fixed mindsets.Living in a world where so much is done with language as with artificial intelligence, we have to think about what we want to be amplified by technology. What reality will technology mirror to us, where will we get stuck in? Even with functions that increase or decrease valuations in an algorithm, it still makes it polarize, non-diverse and non-inclusive. It reduces us to a set of words when we are more than those words. What should we leave to technology and what should we not want to extract?Reductionism is one of the curiosities created by our eternal drive for expansion. Somewhere a contradiction, but we have subjected our own expansion of consciousness and the discovery of new language and art to the expansion of a capitalistic system that does not care about us, the people. Reductionism pushes valuable information out the process and flattens the curve of liveliness. Technology is and will play an even greater role in this it will accelerate this phenomenon.As#theupgradesociety, we try to develop in this space of technology as well. Where we aim for awareness to increase and where capitalism knows its place, hand in hand with technology for a life of well-being.Well-Being in relationship with each other and the world around us.Are you with us?",18 minutes ago

It understands images! GPT-4 can analyze, describe what's in a picture and make logical assumptions.-> Reads pictures and even full articles from a link.üßê 2. It's less likely to be fooled. GPT-4 is trained to stay within boundaries and not be tricked into saying ""weird"" things.-> 82% better filtering of risky content-> 40% more likely to produce factual responsesüìö 3. It has a longer memory. Up to 50 pages of text, in fact. So it can keep track of a conversation a whole story.-> Jump from 3,000 to 25,000 word limit.üëÖ 4. It's multilingual. GPT-4 can answer questions accurately in 26 different languages, a significant improvement from previous models.-> Can build sandcastles from text.-> Much faster and more advanced than the last GTP-3.5.The real world implementations of this for education, customer supports, content creation and more are MASSIVE! I'm really curious where this leads. I will share my findings in future posts.GPT-4 is currently available in the ChatGPT Plus subscription for 20$/month¬†or soon in company APIs. Currently tested with companies likeStripe,Khan Academy,DuolingoandMorgan Stanley.‚ùìIs it worth the paid subscription?

deVere Group,2,1 comment,,"* population crisis in Japan *Japan is facing a population crisis due to its plummeting birth rate, prompting an adviser to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to warn that the country could ""disappear"" if the trend is not reversed. The decreasing birth rate is impacting the world's third-largest economy by putting strain on the labour market, reducing the number of consumers, and increasing demand for healthcare services. The situation also puts pressure on the government's finances and hampers long-term sustainable growth.However, technology and digitisation could play a crucial role in addressing Japan's population issues. Remote work, automation, health tech, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence can be leveraged to help mitigate the impact of the ageing population on the economy and society.Global investors who are serious about building wealth should consider this crisis as an opportunity, as the Japanese government is likely to adopt innovative solutions, making it easier to implement technology-driven approaches. While Japan's population crisis remains a serious issue, it is clear that tech can help provide solutions and present once-in-a-generation opportunities for investors.Speak with an investment advisor today to learn more about how to both protect and maximise the opportunities ahead.

Timothy D. Otten,0,,,"The action and subsequent reactions to yesterday's alleged takedown of a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper by a Russian SU-27 is worth discussing. The takedown occurred over international waters and not over aNATOterritory; thus, steering clear of any Article 5 invocation (reference Article 6). Nevertheless, it does raise the question of whether or not this collision, intentional or unintentional, by a combat aircraft is to be considered an ""armed attack?"" That question matters; because if it is to be considered an ""armed attack"" and if the takedown happened in a NATO member's airspace, then this event would be much more diplomatically challenging with Article 5 potentially in play. But was it an ""armed attack?"" Does it matter that bullets or missiles were not used? Does it matter that the MQ-9 was remotely crewed (un-crewed) with no humans onboard?The latter question brings the work ofErik Lin-Greenbergof theMassachusetts Institute of Technologyand theU.S. Air Force Reserveto my mind. Through comparative wargaming, Erik highlighted how un-crewed aircraft affect conflict escalation in comparison to crewed aircraft. Yesterday's event highlights the importance of continuing this discussion. If you do not want to read the entire study, I have included the link for a quick-read summary located atWar on the Rockslocated below.Unfortunately, this event also highlights one last question. If less escalatory responses are to be expected (i.e. less risk), will militaries and governments be more willing to conduct attacks on the growing fleets of un-crewed assets?All of these questions will only become more applicable with the exponential increase in both un-crewed military operations and artificial intelligence.Link to summary:https://lnkd.in/eCgW6EfmUnited States Marine CorpsUS NavyUnited States Air ForceUS Army#diplomacy#military#law#artificialintelligence#internationalrelations#strategy#future",23 minutes ago
Manmohan S.,2,,,"Thought leadership involves much more than just coming up with clever ideas;It also involves being able to put those forward-thinking ideas into practice and, as a result, drive business-wide results.Bold thought leadership has three characteristics that distinguish it from other leadership styles.1. Reframing CapabilityMachine learning and artificial intelligence are becoming more and more central to everything we do.Bold thought leadership involves proposing practical solutions and foreseeing problems that others have not even thought of.It is not a web of rhetoric and vision.Reporting and analytics can aid leaders in achieving this objective and making a graceful pivot in unforeseen circumstances.In a business environment that is constantly changing,Leaders can benefit from an external advisory board as well as customer outreach to understand how customers will behave in various situations.2. The Capacity To Motivate OthersBold thinkers need to be able to persuade others to support their cause.Businesses can accomplish this by increasing customer engagement.Sharing social issues they care about on social media and other online platforms is another way to do it.3. The Capacity To Identify Early FailureA possible recession will make bold thought leadership even more important for identifying failures, reflecting on them, and learning from them.It is crucial to assess internal procedures and decide whether a company can endure such a situation.You can spot trends early on by creating regular reports and using analytical software.As you might expect, a thought leader is a well-rounded individual who is at ease in the spotlight.Being a thought leader is not a position for everyone, so before pursuing it for one of your executives,Make sure you have found the right candidate with the qualities needed to lead your business to success.#innovationleadership#leadersofthefuture#leadership#teambuilding",23 minutes ago

Tasks such as making decisions, understanding language, recognizing speech, identifying and matching patterns and many more.AI generally makes use of a set of algorithms or instructions to imitate human intelligence.Types of AI include:1. Machine learningThis involves training computer programs to recognize patterns in data. Machine learning takes in data, and learns the data better with statistics, thereby improving its problem solving abilities.2. Deep learning: also known as deep neural learning. This is a type of machine learning that tries to imitate the human brain by inputting data through neural networks that contains a number of hidden layers. The data inputted is processed by making connections and creating patterns.3. General AI:This is a little more complex as it mirrors the human intellect by using its ability to learn and apply knowledge learned to solve problems.The invention of AI is a very huge landmark in the tech space as its uses transcend several areas of human needs.I know for a fact that we all use AI daily, I mean you just used AI some minutes ago by the way.Your fingerprint ID is an AI innovation, your face ID is also not left out.I mean we can yap about the benefits of AI all day but again every good thing has its disadvantages.

Beampad,2,1 comment,,"Rental Property Investment: A Stable and Secure Form of Investment Even in Economic MeltdownIn the 2008 economic recession, the real estate market faced a massive decline, resulting in the collapse of many financial institutions. However, rental properties proved to be a stable and secure form of investment against the recession. While many homeowners struggled to keep up with their mortgage payments, rental properties continued to generate income for their owners.The real estate market has always been considered a safe investment, unlike stocks, rental properties have a tangible asset value that can be used to generate income. Additionally, rental properties offer a steady stream of income, making them an ideal investment for those looking for long-term financial stability.One of the major advantages of investing in rental properties is that they provide a hedge against inflation. As the cost of living increases, so do rental rates, allowing property owners to increase their income accordingly. Furthermore, rental properties provide a steady stream of income even during an economic downturn, making them an excellent long-term investment.Beampad, a real estate technology company, is using blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to make rental property investment even easier. With Beampad's platform, developers and property management companies can tokenize their rental properties, allowing investors to invest and earn dividends from rental income. The tokens are ERC1155 compliant and automatically become liquid, making them easy to buy, sell, or use as collateral in Beampad's lending protocol.Beampad is also using artificial intelligence to provide investors with accurate and up-to-date information about the rental market. The platform's AI algorithms analyze data from various sources to provide investors with insights into market trends, rental rates, and other key information. This information can help investors make informed decisions about which properties to invest in, reducing the risk of investing in properties that may not generate the desired returns.Beampad's innovative use of blockchain technology and AI makes it easier than ever to invest in high-income and sustainable rental properties. By leveraging these technologies, Beampad is making it possible for more people to access the benefits of rental property investment, helping to secure their financial futures.#blockchain#technology#investment#ai#sustainable#bitcoin#property#beampad#beamtoken",41 minutes ago

Atte Roine,0,,,"My mandatory take on OpenAI - I asked it what is dynamic pricing. Sounds  legit.----Dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy where the price of a product or service is adjusted in real-time based on various factors such as demand, supply, seasonality, competition, and customer behavior. Dynamic pricing is often used in industries such as travel, hospitality, e-commerce, and ride-sharing.The main objective of dynamic pricing is to maximize revenue and profit by charging different prices to different customers based on their willingness to pay. For example, airlines use dynamic pricing to adjust ticket prices based on the time of booking, the number of available seats, and the demand for the flight.Dynamic pricing can be implemented using various algorithms and techniques such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics. These techniques enable businesses to analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior and adjust prices accordingly.While dynamic pricing can be beneficial for businesses by increasing revenue and profitability, it can also be controversial among customers who may feel that they are being unfairly charged different prices. As such, businesses need to be transparent and communicate their pricing strategy clearly to their customers.",43 minutes ago

Adetimilehin Obanla,2,,,"5 ways in picking profitable stocksJust like how Benjamin Graham cited in his evergreen book, 'The Intelligent investor' knowing the value of a stock and the fair price to pay for a stock is way superior to speculation.Being objective in your approach to investing will place you within the space of profitable investors rather than being subjective to market behavior characterized by the fear/greed index.Here are 5 ways to pick profitable stocks1. Choose profitable or promising industries, then invest in the firms/companies that are part of those industries.Knowing what industries that are viable in the future gives you an edge in picking the right stocks. For example; the Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality industries have started to gain widespread acceptance. Pitching your tent in this space will increase your chance of becoming profitable in the long run.2. Quantitative AnalysisThe financials of a firm/company is a huge indication to know if you should buy into their business or not. Knowing the Balance sheet, Income statement and statement of cash flow in a company can well inform you in buying into the company.  3.3. Always invest in indexes (Diversify your portfolio)We all know it is not wise to put all your eggs in one basket. Profitable hedge fund manager Ray Dalio is said to have a strategy of investing in 15 indexes that have a negative correlation, diversifying his portfolio. If you lose money in one company, your other profits in another company can help you cover up for the money lost.4. Qualitative AnalysisBrand recognition is a huge plus in making a decision to buy a stock. Brands like Apple, and Coca-Cola make it easy for investors to buy their stock because of acceptance and what they represent.5. LeadershipThe leadership of the business has a profound impact on the business and its future relevance. It is important to have a good view of who is leading the brand to inform your purchasing decisions.My name is Adetimilehin and I am a Financial Market Analyst. I hope this piece helped, thank you.#business#investing#leadership#artificialintelligence#stocks#stockstowatch#strategy#brand",43 minutes ago

Furthermore, depending on how AI models are trained and deployed,#dataprotection,#intellectualproperty,#antitrustand intermediary liability concerns may exist.While many of these problems are not new, and are inherent to the existence of the internet itself, there is a need for governments to understand the key issues pertaining to AI and develop robust laws and regulations.

It may take some time for companies to fit into it, for resources, regulations, or even cultural barriers make it difficult to implement new technologies.While some farmers use technology to improve their operations, many smaller farms may need more investment inputs. While the healthcare industry has been adopting new technologies, there are concerns about patient privacy and the security of electronic medical records.Some sectors have utilized deep Tech for years, and some manage operations with minimal tech inputs. Some industries may face unique challenges that make it difficult to adopt new technologies, while others may not see the benefits of doing so.The more we tackle the barriers, the faster tech advancements will reach businesses.

Why will this give retail an incredible breakthrough?All the artificial world of communications has received all the necessary tools to become perfect, wait for them to be adapted for retail or get ahead of everyone in creating new communication tools of a new level.To create (repeat) a visual image of a person was the first, (https://lnkd.in/d2xChxrV) what could be done in the triune communication model: visual image, voice and ""intelligence"" and the ""fault"" of the cinema, where it is very much in demand.I was offered to make my image myself, but when I asked this image to speak with my voice, they said that it was 100 times more expensive and more difficult to do. And why do I need my animated image without my voice!And so Microsoft made a breakthrough (https://lnkd.in/dEiwD6f2) and now, instead of 60 thousand hours of speech, which were previously used to train a speech generator, only 3 seconds became enough (!!!!) and she can already synthesize various shades of speech (https://valle-demo .github.io/): anger, disgust, drowsiness, amazement, etc.). Fearing an avalanche of fakes, they did not put the VALL-E code into open access, but sooner or later, someone will build a similar model and it will be ubiquitous.And now it turns out there are all three components for changing communications in retail:‚Ä¢ a visual image indistinguishable from a real person‚Ä¢ GPT3 language model (https://lnkd.in/dhffWR2W), which is ""smarter"" than the average person‚Ä¢ and now she can start speaking in the voice of any of your employeesAnd all this has fallen out on us literally in the last six months, hurry up to master these tools ‚Äì they are great and promising.#storeof the future#retailof the future#shop4_0#innovationitaila#consumerstudies#CJM#ITTechnologiesMy Telegram channel ""Agatov Boris Tech Store 4.0""https://t.me/agatov_tech.About mehttp://agatov.pro/ (speeches, moderation, consulting)",1 hour ago

With advancements in machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision, AI is transforming the way we work and making businesses more efficient, effective, and profitable.One of the most significant benefits of AI in business is the ability to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more complex and creative work. This can save companies time and money while also improving the quality and accuracy of their output. AI-powered chatbots are also being used to improve customer service, providing instant responses to queries and reducing response times.Another area where AI is making a significant impact is in data analysis. By processing vast amounts of data, AI algorithms can identify patterns and trends that humans may miss, providing insights that can inform decision-making and improve business strategies. AI-powered analytics tools can also help businesses personalize their marketing efforts, identifying and targeting specific customer segments based on their preferences and behavior.AI is also transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. In healthcare, AI-powered diagnostics tools can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses, while in finance, AI-powered fraud detection systems can identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. In manufacturing, AI-powered predictive maintenance tools can help prevent equipment breakdowns, minimizing downtime and reducing costs.However, as with any new technology, there are also challenges associated with the adoption of AI in business. One of the most significant concerns is the potential impact on jobs, with some predicting that AI could replace many human workers. To address this, businesses need to consider the ethical implications of AI and develop strategies for reskilling and upskilling their employees.In summary, AI is transforming the way we work and opening up new opportunities for businesses across industries.

Unrealistic standards for HRIA/FRIA, rather than a general methodology, and lengthy and cumbersome assessment models (including misunderstandings in risk assessment) are not in line with the previous experience in DPIA/HRIA and are likely to turn FRIA into a mere ticking-box and bureaucratic exercise.Although a bureaucratic exercise may be of interest to a part of the standardisation and consultancy business, past experience teaches us that compliance only on paper does not help to tackle risks effectively.It would therefore be important for the EU bodies (includingEuropean Union Agency for Fundamental RightsandCEN and CENELEC), to start a serious and inclusive discussion on FRIA, avoiding inner circles and including real domain experts and critical voices.",

Sebastian Comsa,8,1 comment,,"I rarely share these kinds of stories; however, this one stuck with me, and it has been quite a personal one. I was flying on a business trip the other day to Bucharest - Frankfurt - Luxembourg (Monday) and back to Bucharest via Munich from Luxembourg (Tuesday). So I had the pleasure of experiencing how an AI solution with no human supervision can impact your travel schedule when flights are delayed, missed connection and arrival of 6hours+ at the destination.So why has this stuck with me? I have been talking a lot about ethics and explainability in AI. Not just industries like financial services should be under scrutiny when it comes to the usage of AI in decision processes. Such as credit scoring and load applications that are processed without human intervention, and financial institutions need to prove and explain to the regulator why the AI solution took that decision.So what happened to me? My first leg of the flight was delayed, which in turn made me lose my connecting flight; now, as you'd imagine in a usual scenario, you'd think you will be rebooked on the next flight. And I was rebooked to the next flight back from where I started my journey, not to my actual destination. So clearly, this airline company's new AI solution has made a wildly inaccurate decision that impacted me. It cancelled all other flights and booked me on the returning flight from Frankfurt to Bucharest. So the AI decided that I don't necessarily need to be in Luxembourg because I need to return to Bucharest right after arriving in Frankfurt.Oh, hi,Lufthansa; let's talk about ethics, explainability and accountability when using AI solutions that impact your passengers in a way that there is no human supervision. I'm a big fan of yours, but your goals of saving on personal and investing in a solution that needs to be adequately trained are giving you more trouble than saving money.I want to give big kudos to the ladies in the Lufthansa Senator Lounge Hall B (FRA Airport) for doing their best in reinstating my flights and booking me on the last flight to Luxembourg so I can get there and attend an important client meeting! This proves that AI solutions can't replace the ethics and empathy of human touch in these processes, so kudos for their actions in trying to make it right! Is there any explainability included in the decisioning of the AI process?Lufthansa, I recommend getting up to speed with the latest directives at theEuropean Parliament- legislation in progress (https://lnkd.in/eiu_sRHb) for Artificial Intelligence liability directives; this will cover accountability. üòéNevertheless, kudos again to your excellentLufthansaground staff who got me to the end where I needed to go, even though it was 6h+ later; now let's talk privately about my customer rights ( on missed connection and delayed arrival at destination).#ai#travel#explainableai#ethicalai#dataanalytics",1 hour ago

However, 2022 saw widespread exposure of the technology world to these tools. OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot are powerful tools that provide programmers with intelligent code recommendations and completion for improved development efficiency.üîπ The Codex model series is a descendant of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3 series, which has been trained on natural language as well as billions of lines of code. Codex is all about translation. Thanks to OpenAI Codex, computers are more able to understand our intentions. It allows us to use natural languages and interpret these inputs into lines of code.üîπ When understanding the way how OpenAI Codex operates, developers can find their workload to be much lessened. What they must do is to divide the large problem into smaller ones and describe the APIs, libraries, and functions so that Codex understands exactly what they want. The Codex system will handle the rest, making suggestions and generating lines of code according to the input.üîπ GitHub Copilot (using OpenAI Codex) is a cloud-based artificial intelligence software powered by GitHub and OpenAI that supports programmers by autocompleting code. It is now available for usage by developers in Neovim, JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code. According to GitHub's research, GitHub Copilot generates more than 40% of code for developers who use it on average, increasing coding speed by 55%.‚ú® ùêÅùêûùêßùêûùêüùê¢ùê≠ùê¨ ùê®ùêü ùêÜùê¢ùê≠ùêáùêÆùêõ ùêÇùê®ùê©ùê¢ùê•ùê®ùê≠‚ö°Ô∏è It makes recommendations for code based on the project‚Äôs context and style convention and even suggests providing the complete algorithms, accelerating the speed of coding‚ö°Ô∏è It is relatively easy to use‚ö°Ô∏è GitHub Copilot has helped 88% of devs feel substantially more productive.For that reason, OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot deem inevitably valuable tools for developers. At the same time, while it is impossible to reject the mind-blowing functions and assistance of these two tools in programming, keep in mind that they cannot entirely replace programmers because they need our input and critical editing for producing viable code in reality.---Ohio Digital - More than a partnerAddress:- 6 Kingsborough Way, Zetland, NSW 2017, Australia- 11F, MITEC Building, Duong Dinh Nghe Street, Yen Hoa, Cau Giay, Hanoi, VietnamEmail:info@ohio-digital.comTel: (+84) 24 3795 5813#Technology#News#OpenAI#Github",1 hour ago
