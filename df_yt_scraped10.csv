I think AI creates jobs and eliminates some, like most technological advances. What is a greater concern for me is rather how AI could be misused to rob creative people's work by imitating them too closely, or the fact that AI needs a lot of calculating power which in turn leads to more pollution, but we're hardly ever talking about that aspect.

could you have a graphic display be that responsive, as the pond I mean? those blue squares for example. Could you see that in real time? Maybe map it with sentiment analysis of the world's social networks and show that as color on a screen?

I think about this a lot. To see someone has actually done it on such a grand scale at a professional level is truly inspiring.",4,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-EIVlHvHRM

It was such a surreal thing to witness this, as reality around me wasn't shifting and warping as intense as this, yet when I was looking at this canvas, that had new york cityscape on it, the clouds and sky was rapidly moving as if in a timelapse and the buildings where all building up and down and shifting and morphing.

Chat GPT: वृतनुमा चक्र के 14 मीटर क्षेत्र के लिए रंगने का खर्च 10 रुपए प्रति वर्ग मीटर होगा।

As humans, we're somewhat limited by how many experiments we can run at the same time, computational power (or giving instructions to computers to calculate for us), creating models, etc., especially in things we have to do by hand, where's one step at a time. While this AI can take multiple routes at the same time, and probably calculate them faster than us doing a single one.

That's the neural architecture used by organisms with higher brain functions here on Earth.
Its failing in human modalities in part because it's using human structural precepts.
I should caution that it's not sentient, and not a person, but this is because it both lacks a temporal component and is a static model.
If this model had a temporal component then it could have a continuous persistent interaction state, even if it was incapable of being able to learn.
If it was engaging in realtime training as a live model, then it would be capable of reacting and adapting to its existence.

Perhaps the AI ""interpreted"" the question as 'not having' a magnetic field, instead of 'having a weak' magnetic field, completely missing that a slow rotation would most likely not prevent the formation of a magnetic field, but only make it weak, thus it was the right answer. Also, if it was an ""interpretation"" error, then information on Venus auroras was either missing from the dataset, or the AI never made a strong link between Auroras and magnetic fields, which is a bit odd.",0,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQIx_C8mHo

I think if we really got down into what is very interesting and very important that the whole world use Google how many people talk to Google how many people ask things about Google or to search on Google it is a system of human beings on a Quantum System Program to understand the human race a lot better A lot more performance and what do we really need in this world for the human race not no stupid math problems that don't mean anything it's not helping us it's not going anywhere but this Quantum system of Google Uprising show us a lot more about who we are what we looking for what we need in life and what we are asking for the most in this world to survive live be loved cared for or any other program that we all want to understand you know how many people are on this system that is a network of a brain of the human race do you understand how big that is we would never have anything like it ever before so why would we do math medical problems with it why can't we ask it the world problem of human race that is what the main product on the system that is always on it you guys are missing the big picture we're not worried about if it's smarter than a human it is like a Quantum human product of the world I don't know it just amazes me that we have built something so massive and such a Quantum Leap in so many areas in life that we missed the whole reason that Google was built for in the first place and a lot bigger and it will answer a lot more questions in a mathematical equation you just don't understand how much we put into that Ai and how much it knows about the human race more than we know about ourselves but what do I know I'm just a person out here at these something bigger and better in a Quantum system that we built that we take for granted I'm a nobody I'm just a glitch clicking In-N-Out?,0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICQIx_C8mHo

2242,              Yoshui _            ,"I'm a highschool student planning to pursue art in college. Not to seem narrow-minded here, but i do fear that my plans of becoming a professional artist won't work out. 

I've read a lot of different opinions about ai art and I can't really believe those people who say: ""Don't worry, ai art won't ever be able to replace artists. People will still invest in hand-drawn pictures, because many would still want to receive art that is unique to that said artists style."" Don't get me wrong, i do agree with that statement, but there are already a few cases where ai programmers stole the style of a paticular artist and used it to create their own ai generated images representing that exact artist's art style. Of course, this is how ai generated art is created in the first place - by feeding a machine artworks that other people drew after years and years of practice. Why should people pay thousands of dollars to commission an artist with a unique style when they can just create their own images in that exact same style? Theres no law that prevents art theft (see the samdoesarts drama) the way it works in the music industry. Artist already have it difficult enough to make a living, all ai art does is point a big middlefinger in their faces. 

Of course right now ai images look pretty and impressive, honestly i cant help loving those simply beautiful images. Ai art lacks specificness though - you cant really  adjust the outcome the way you could if you drew the images yourself - at least not yet. 
If we've already come this far, who knows what the future will hold: many more artists will have to switch to ai art, simply because everyone else will as well. I dont think a newcommer will have any luck in the art industry, especiallly when ai art got to the point where its difficult to tell apart from hand-drawn images. 

""Art is moving in a different direction"" is what one comment below said, but i feel like the aspects that are unique to art - that the picture  has to be drawn first to exist after years of dedication and practice - will perish. Of course people can still pursue art as a hobby,  also in a professional way if they want to, but the art industry will most likely change to the more efficient and less time-consuming ai art, which will still need creative people to generate and evolve them. Although i do understand this change, i can't say im looking forward to it. Theres something about robots creating art that does not sit right with me. 
It feels inhumane and unreal. 
Why do we have to programm robots to replace artists? Why does everything have to be more efficient and mechanical? At least the pictures are pretty, i guess.

AI art seems incredible, but also seems to remove the imaginative and logical processes from the human. I use bits of AI in most of my very novice work, but the processes to develop my work seem to have had a huge impact on my ability to imagine even more. AI seems more like a toy and I am far more excited about my imaginative and logical neurological growth than that of the ai engines. IMO, and I would bet the same of the great stoic philosophers (the obstacle is the way), AI could be compared to limiting one's athleticism and physical potential to strictly watching others do it on TV. I have never considered myself an artist, but even with the AI tools I do use, I have grown even far greater respect for those that actually use pencils and paints or similar.

People rarely hire portrait artist and the camera gave birth to modern art.  My real fear has less to do with my background in art then it does with my time as a programmer.  Creative fields of every sort have long been protected by machines inability to learn, adapt and create.  Art is fundamental to all creativity .  The ability to picture something in ones head before making it real.  Computers were always better at the second half, making things based on physical laws then the first.  This my friends is the opening salvo to something greater then the Industrial revolution with both great promise and great threat .  i do not think humanity nor our social political systems are prepared or preparing for what comes next.  When machines can build anything beyond our own imaginations without need for us...what becomes the role of humanity?  AI is already becoming waiters , grocery clerks , delivery services, factory workers.  Between 3d printing, self learning creative machines...what use is there for workers?

It's definitely a two edged sword, to which the sharpest edge is to be most likely wielded by industry at their whim. Much like corporations. As I've been viewing the artwork that's been generated, and it didn't take long for me to see that there's still something very standardized about it. To me, no matter how stunning the work appears, there's something still underlining the work that's missing, like it's too sterile. It's the same thing I noticed when the audio industry was transitioning from analog to digital sound. Digital sound was much thinner because it was taking actual sound waves and converting them into digital data that was intended for duplication, because using cassette tape loss sound quality with each pass and digital didn't. But look at how far digital audio has come now. The time of analog recording studios being common have long passed. But have audio engineers dropped off the planet, no... And recording studios still exist. Do I believe AI Art is going anywhere... No. To the contrary, it's just beginning. I've seen this debate play out before. First in a major audio studio, when ProTools was first coming out the great debate. Then in cinema, out with super 8 and telecines, in with DVR. Hell, land lines vs cell phones... You get what I mean. The point I'm making here is this, with each change that's come, we as people adapt and find ways to make these changes still work for us, ESPECIALLY ARTIST. Did the conversion from analog to digital completely destroy recording studios, no, they still exist. Did the introduction of drum machines kill off drummers, no, they incorporate them in their sets even. Did digital mixers, kill off dj's, again no. You've got dj's that have transferred their turntable skills into their MacBook's and are doing both. I can go on and on. Artist can never be erased, because it's the one area that truly holds no real confined definition in the first place.

2313,              cwagular            ,"As an artist and a programmer, here is my large pile of thoughts about this:

I have mixed feelings about this as many of you also probably do. It will certainly disrupt the commercial art industry and my heart goes out to the freelancers that will be affected by this. Perhaps sites like Pinterest should also be considering how these algorithms can disrupt mood-boards etc. 

But if you first use the tool, you will realize that many of the colors, textures and design elements that the algorithms add to your images are selected from the data it is trained on without much of your own intention or context. The algorithms by default start with literal random noise and builds the image from there. You can of course add your own images and refine the prompt details, making your results more and more specific to get to the final render you want. What do we call this process? 

To get something decent from this, you still need intention, decent taste, a discerning eye, perhaps some comedic or poetic intuition as well when coming up with the prompts. (You will also find that as you add more and more details to your prompts, the results may start to break down. Maybe this is something that will improve over time, or maybe I myself am not skilled enough at prompt generation to avoid these pitfalls)

You create these images based on data made from the hard work of countless artists before. IP and legal stuff will certainly be an interesting question with these algorithms….

Would I say that images created by this tool were created by me? Not personally. I would say that I came up with the prompt idea, and guided the AI tool to arrive at a result that I wanted. It feels somewhat collaborative. It does certainly bother me when people take raw images from these tools and say “look what I made!”. The AI fills in too many design decisions for me to ever feel comfortable saying that I made those choices, unless I happened to make the prompt specific enough to do so. Some other artists have made those design choices already, and ideally these algorithms would give them some credit. 

My point is, good design is purposeful and design decisions should be made with actual purpose/intention, contextualized by the needs of your project. Examples: this character needs five feathers on their wing because it is symbolic for something, or this new smartphone needs to be in this shape for this very specific usability reason, etc.

The random search of these algorithms may get lucky and arrive at an image that will exactly satisfy your needs, especially if your needs are not very specific. For an actual commercial project like a game, movie, product design etc., more often many of the images produced by this tool are not good enough for a final render. 

This tool is good for brainstorming ideas, providing bottomless inspiration for design elements, and also can be a great source of material for digitally inclined creatives. I have seen artists generate several of these images and take elements from each, Photoshopping elements of them together into a purposeful and meaningful digital collage piece of sorts. 3D artists can use it to make textures for their games or renders. It significantly lowers the barrier to creation, and will no doubt disrupt the industry. I even have a friend who uses it in their DnD group to make backgrounds for their games. 

The value of a digital image will be reassessed under these conditions; perhaps more emphasis will be placed on the poetry or ideas behind these synthetic images. Not to mention that these AI cannot create a physical painting. They cannot create a physical piece of pottery made by hand and burned in a kiln for three days of of the coast of some distant island in Japan. When a robot makes its own conscious decision to travel to some far off land to paint the sunset off the shore and comes back with masterpiece that embodies its own experience with love, nostalgia, and heartbreak, maybe that will be the day that artists of all mediums should be afraid. Until then, these algorithms are just tools

Perhaps there will also be value on art created without the use of AI, 100% human organic wholesale kind of thing. I would not be surprised if there was a backlash to using AI tools in some sectors, especially as we are saturated with more and more of these synthetic images. Maybe there will also be emphasis on the process people use to get their results, for example those painters that record videos of themselves painting are a work of art in and of themselves.

Further disruptive technologies powered by AI are certain to come; videos, music etc can also be generated by AI. But again, the algorithms still require a human to come up with the idea (driven by a creative impulse, design need, etc), refine the result through several iterations, doctor the results (perhaps some post processing, not to mention fixing the terrifying faces these early algorithms create). It is not replacing humans quite yet. 

The real danger lies in how the commercial industry will use this stuff. We already live in a world where many “creative” decisions are made simply to get the most money, and not necessarily to create the most original or thought provoking pieces of work. I am worried that these algorithms will exacerbate problems we are seeing in an already stilted media industry, where pop culture already feels rehashed and derivative. It sounds incredibly boring to live in a world where synthetic images are created from datasets of rehashed synthetic images. But that is also why these algorithms cannot replace the human aspect. 

These algorithms can recombine data in ways that can even be considered creative by some definitions, but they simply cannot incorporate new lived experience. The works made by them are by definition derivative. Additionally, the images you are allowed to create will be limited by the prompts you are allowed to use, dictated by the companies that own the tools. If you have used DALLE-2 or Midjourney, you will realize that they are both especially strict to prevent legal issues on their end. In that sense, when you are using these algorithms, your creativity is still pretty bounded. 

Humans will by virtue of living will always have new data and experiences available to them, and that is where the freshest, rawest material comes from in my opinion. That “you couldn’t make this stuff up” moment when someone is telling a story. 

Don’t stay inside looking at a screen all day, live life to the fullest (and perhaps I should take my own advice, ha). Go outside, fall in love with something or someone, then lose it all and do it again. Live your life, acquire new experiences, write about them, make creative projects that reflect what you have learned. Don’t compare yourself to other humans or AI algorithms. Authentic experiences are by definition irreplacable.",646,47,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

What makes us designer win against this is that we can make ""arguably"" better design if we can follow what our client wants.

When it does work really well is in making art that is already not really fine art in the first place, such as digital painterly looking portraits or with a 3d rendered look.  Its can copy and imitate, it can generate great reference work based on very specific ideas. But now everytime is see AI art I feel disinterested because its obviously AI art.  In my opinion it is a great tool to compliment artists and make the assist the process of an artist.  It does not however replace human made work beyond the generic level.  I see AI generated editorial illustrations and they look like crap because they are so clearly AI and make the company who have chosen to use AI for such purposes seem lazy.  AI will undoubtedly replace some artists who quickly produce mediocre work for advertisers.  In the future they will get better at imitation, but they will not be producing graphic novels, movies, comics, anime, ect.  They will assist in the process, but AI on its own is too generic and inconsistent and lacking soul and character to be a replacement for things I consider fine art.

AI may take over in large, people like fast easy and cheap. It may be fun for things that *dont matter*, like the 'wow' of smoke and mirrors, but it could never replace my own work for ME, where every bit is my own just as i put it out of myself. 
If i create it, it feels - it IS- mine. 
Theres a connection.

No matter how detailed prompts id write, an AI would NEVER be able to make the EXACT thing id want to paint. Not even if it really understood complex specific prompts.
Not when im so very particular about every single detail, every brush stroke to be exactly as i want it to, every color and every little thing. 
 
When a piece matters, when its your art, your vision, then every detail matters. There is no way an AI could ever make it as you would. Even if nobody else would know or care, you as the artist would. Because the THING and your touch is largely in those details, in the flick of your hand, every decision you make as you progress.
It could never be the same done by anyone or anything else.
If you are an artist you itch to create, not just to impress/sell, but to bring it to life. And if you ever want to bring your thing to life, not just an approximation of the idea, you always gotta do it yourself.

These exceptionally hyper realism paintings that may have been produced by AI then printed on high quality, wide format printers disguised as being paintings by human artists are receiving so much attention that it's mind boggling. I know that artists can paint realistic images but as an artist myself, in both digital and mixed media, I can distinguish an actual painting from a digital reproduction. I know subtle details that boarders between paint and pixels to make a distinction between two mediums. Again, just a thought and I don't want to be premature in judging something and be found wrong.

2375,              Philip Howe Artist/Writer            ,"As an illustrator and painter I tell my students not to worry about this as it still takes drawing skill and comping, concept, and 2 and 3d rendering ability to create specific imagery that no computer can do. You can type in a million prompt details and its still just suggestions the AI makes. In the work world, its a direct approach, not hit and miss. I do like some of the random imagery that can suggests ideas or directions, but after that, its up to every creative person to go well beyond this process. And there will be many amateurs who suddenly think they are doing art simply because they are typing in intriguing prompts. I remember people who were early users of Photoshop filters trying to sell prints of converted photos (Watercolor filter, etc.) Or via Painter's paint cloners. This takes about the same amount of integrity to produce. 
The big thing I would be wary of is how the base imagery is calculated, or where it's from. If it's using photos or videos to abstract from, merged with multiple source imagery pulled off the net, then that's copyright infringement, as in the Jack Sparrow sample. I'm thinking the engine is surveying thousands, or more, images online and merging them beyond recognizable originals, based on the text input.

2405,              Laanie            ,"I think AI Generated art ties into the whole debate of whether or not that one day, when AI is fully developed to the point that it has the same intellect and reasoning as a normal human being, whether that AI should be treated as ""equal"" to humans or to be seen as just some tool to accomplish things.
 
Now I'm no artist, but if were to put in time to make a piece of art in the style of, let’s say Vincent Van Gogh, would it be considered art that is somehow stolen or unethically made in regard to the real artist? No. But it should be noted that my new piece of art would in fact be my own because I painted it. Using that same reasoning, AI Art can be seen as the AI's own art, not the art from the original artist that the prompts are based off of, and certainly not the person's art that is typing in the prompts for its generation, because at the end of the day, those prompts are just setting the parameters for what the AI is allowed to ""think"" with in order to create a piece of art. At the end of the day, it is the AI that creates the art, not the prompter.
 
Now the type of people that take advantage of AI art to generate art pieces that they might be incapable of creating on their own, and then claiming that to be their own art, in my opinion would be unethical. They are taking the AI's ""own"" property and saying that it belongs to themselves. That's like saying that I take Van Gogh's painting, The Starry Night, to be my own painting, which it in fact is not. 
 
Now having read the above two paragraphs, it is clear that I as a person am already putting value in AI as a ""being"". One could argue that those who take advantage of AI, merely see the concept of AI as a tool that they can use like a fancy new paintbrush to just make what they want. They might not believe that artificial intelligence has the same value as natural intelligence. Does that give justice to their actions of using AI art generation as a tool, I don't know. That is something that will be defined in the years to come.

Also, to call it “intelligent” is a stretch. It is a tool.  A fast one.  The artist is the one providing the prompts, tweaking it, getting just what they want to tell the emotional story.  Based on the prompts I’ve seen, it will expand the visual vocabulary of a generation of creators.

George Martin (the 5th Beatle) was just as responsible for the sound of the Beatles as the fab 4. Did he play the guitar? No. Did he write the songs?

You are encouraged to take the time to study other works of art very closely and observe how it was drawn, what is the feeling behind it, what little things make this stand out that the artist added. The more art you study and the more you practice, spending years of practice, will you then be able to slowly and gradually get better until you can build a portfolio of original artwork to proudly show off.

When an AI wants to learn art, what it has to do by far and large is to look at the works of other people or at least the ones that it is told to look at if you want it to specialize in something. It takes the time to study other works of art very closely and observe how it was drawn, what is the feeling behind it, what little things make this stand out that the artist added. The more art it studies and the more it practices, spending hours of practice, will it then be able to slowly and gradually get better until it can build a sample sheet of original artwork to proudly show off.

There's not really much of any difference between the two, the AI model files contain no image data at all. The only thing stored in AI model files is a sort of numeric memory of what the AI has learned when looking at other artwork and it uses that numeric memory to paint original images to the best of it's ability (depending on how long it spent studying and learning). This is no different from a human. The main 2 issues I see with this are peoples pride and ego as humans, unable to accept works made by creations of humans and the misunderstanding of how AI works, assuming it's copying bits and pieces of artwork online and mashing it together which is inaccurate.",2,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

No contracts, no paperwork, no risk of lawsuits, no pension, no wage, no medical benefits.

Plagiarism was already a problem out of laziness and this enables that beyond 110%.

I’d say this is mostly bad for artists.  Human-made art will be reduced to a novelty aka rare aka small.  And no one can tell the difference.

It cannot be original but most people don’t care about originality.  They think they do, but when the real world pressures an employer with time, originality becomes unimportant.",166,17,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw
2475,              Laurence Schneider            ,"This is actually pretty amazing! But here are some thoughts about this quick development of technology and how it is affecting us in general (watch out!!! big text coming):
Everything we create in technology works by understanding the real (physical) world around us and how we as human beings function. So for every technological invention there is an organic origin.
For example: understanding the physics behind flying (mostly by analysing birds) humans could finally build airplanes. The organic origin of flying with an airplane to come from one place to another is simply walking, the organic origin of texting a friend on your phone is communication with her or him in real life, the organic origins are eather physical or mental skills of a human being now more and more reproduced in a technological or digital dimension. The more technology we use, that replaces ""organic"" skills, the more we lose these original skills. A good example is using google maps, without it most of us, especially the younger generations, would have a hard time to orientate. It`s great to make things easier with new inventions, but the question is if at some point our lifes will become too inorganic which is like the basic futuristic idea that humanity will completely unit with technology and that is already happening. You don't need parts of a robot inside your face to merge with technology. Just go on a one week vacation without using a phone and you will see that you already integrated it to a large extend inside your brain. This process is harder to grasp because it is also happening on a mental level. 
A human being is not a machine that can be copied! There will always something be missing in technology that can never be reproduced. Some call it the soul, some a knowing pressence, the core of the being, the divine inside, maybe just love.. whatever it comes down to an AI is always based on logic, but logic is just the language of our brains to describe the world around us, existence itself is not necessarely logical. At least if you want to refute that it is not based on logic we run into a dilemma because the prove that it's all based on logic is only coming from the place of logical thinking. How could we ever make sense of the infinty of time and space? Looking at the logical field that is to a  great part working with numbers, there is no last number.. we just made up a symbol for infinity that does not represent a final number. Feelings, especially love, that are on of the most important aspects of our lifes will never be part of pure logic. That is known for thousands of years. Or do you really believe AIs can fall in love and really feel in a certain way like we do? I doubt it, maybe they can act like they are able to, but the soul aspect is missing and that will happen to some of us too if we let technology take over all aspects of life. Nature and our own being are the greatest teachers where we learned everything from and it holds so much more secrets waiting for us to discover. Programming and developing AIs is just possible because we understood how the logical mind works, starting with the basic binary system of 1 and 0 - an on and off signal. In nature and existence basically this seperation of one thing into two to understand the concept behind it (duality) doesn't exist. Examples for these seperations are: light and darkness, black and white, beginning and end, the one thing implies the other, they are inseperable from each other and only make sense to us by looking at both parts. We can not draw with black colour on a block screen, we need a seperation for our mind to make sense out of it. But it's not how reality works it's just how we decode it. There is no beginning and no end there is no right and no wrong in the universe it's just based on human concepts. 
I know for mself that love is our true nature and it will create new life - not a logical thought will be responsible for that. Or do you want to have a child just to keep up the species if you think so maybe you are an AI! We are loving human beings that should be care for each other and for ourselves. Nature is the place to heal, real life is our true nature, we didn't came here to destroy this wonderful planet and transcend to a artifical dimension. Maybe that sounds too extreme but we need to think about extreme concepts to understand true values. When you would die within the next two or three hours how would you spend your time? Your answer to that question will get the illusions of this material world right out the way ;)
We are what we eat - can be seen in bigger picture: Everything we take in (information, feelings, thoughts, music,..) affects our physical, mental and emotional health, so be mindful what you feed yourself thoughout the day! Maybe it is worth trying to understand something i wrote and have new inspirations coming up or give me some criticism about this comment written in shitty english.

This A.I. has the concept of aesthetics of a human mind really understood. It does bring art out. Amateur artists will not have the quality of designs as the A.I. can bring out. Then of course comes also the infinite quantity. As an artist, you need to hone your skills for years and even decades and usually one is very good at one thing. and good at few things. the A.I. can be good at everything. of course, the details are not perfect from the A.I. but they usually do not matter and even if, they look fit. it does make the job of an artist kind of redundant and soon companies and non-artists will lose their respect toward the human artist. a la ""i can do that, too, within 20 seconds and one-click what you need a whole day or even a week. that is nothing special."" I do hear the comment from people in art it is about the human and the process. well, that is a way to romanticize it from which I am not a fan. In the end, the results matter, because on average an artist and the process aren´t known anyway. the only positive thing you can have from this A.I. from an artist's perspective is, to test your ideas. But then you get into an identity crisis and start wondering if your personal imagination is even valid enough to be put down on paper with the brush. I can personally say. If you do not enjoy your own results just for them being yours and the process behind it, then it will feel just tragic. like a really bad joke. I also believe this A.I came too early into being. decades and centuries too early.

Right now, they have released a portion that is not yet using all information, but just a very large sample of text. What happens is, if you give it a close to impossible task, to compare large complicated works, like the Bible and The Illiad, and tell it to analyze and compare it and write it in the way that Stephen King writes, it will do it in about 3 seconds.  AI can’t do anything on it’s own, so it’s pretty safe to say that it will steal everything that it uses to do it’s work. It’s taking intellection property and using it to create the results that people are asking it to create. Make a van gough style painting of the Starry  night in Mordor from Lord of the rings, using orange and yellow, it will create that in about 8 seconds. It takes styles and talent that people worked a lifetime to achieve, uses it to create it for you, which will make most professions irrelevant… Programmers? Gone. all types of designers, Gone. Writers? Also Gone. Why would I spend years to learn Photoshop, Illustrator or InDesign if I can ask a computer to do it for me. That will create generations of lazy Youtube star like people ordering anything and everything under the AI sun. Anything that can be done by computer will be able to be done by AI, at their own expense, because AI will use their talents against them. 

Some people say that they said the same when the automobile was created. YEs, they did, but the major difference is that it displaced farmers who bread horses and grew the feed and the excrement shovelers keeping the streets clean. They all retrained to learn other things, and automobiles created more jobs because cars needed to be fixed and maintained. And retraining took time and education... with AI, Writers, programers, storyboard artists, graphic designers, painters, software writers, authors, researchers, illustrators, and virtually every single person who uses a computer to make intellectual property will be out of a job... and what will they train or reeducate themselves to become afterwards?

2592,              Marko Posavec            ,"Biggest problem with AI art generation in my opinion is that it is advertised as more than it really is. While what it does is impressive from a programming perspective as such things would be completely impossible to program by hand. It is not really impressive when thinking in terms of Intelligence. Also there is very little unique about the generated images in actual fact. It merely repacks the things it ""learned"" from other peoples work by randomizing the output. But this learning is so closely tied to the actual image pixels that it makes the output just a glorified copy. The process is very mechanical and exact in a way that really infringes on the work of actual people who's art is in the training set. It's fine as a demonstration of technology but using it to ""make"" something and claim it as your own is totally ridiculous.

2622,              Michael J Walls            ,"I find it ridiculous to call those who are ""Prompting"" an A.I. to create the artwork on their behalf, based on the user's thought salad, can be taken seriously as ""Artists"".  

Anyone who has no concept of the time, effort, or energy it takes to create an original piece of artwork by hand, who does not use the internal vision of their own minds,  influences and experiences they consume during the course of their own lives, which truly make their own works unique to themselves, but choose to use the A.I. to produce randomized work samples on behalf of them, could never in real life, so easily create similar works on their own, in any reasonable amount of time, or expense, without God given talent, or hard earned practice and work.

Those who use an A.I. to produce high concept, detailed artwork to pawn off as ""their own"", and at the same time, have the hubris to call themselves ""Artist"" should NEVER be considered, ""Artist"".  

The fact that they are using ""Artificial Intelligence"" rather than ""Authentic Intelligence"" to create for them makes this clear.  Using text to create artwork via an A.I., turns the user simply into a client, who basically is commissioning artwork from an A.I. subcontractor to produce the artwork for them.  Those calling themselves ""Artist"" who use A.I. to produce on behalf of themselves are hardly even ""Coders"" at this point.  

Simply give credit where credit is due.   The A.I. is the Artist. 

Everyone else that feeds the A.I. it's instructions are either ""Prompters"" or ""Thoughts"" that feed the Midjourney machine, and those apps like it, which in reality, doesn't even think for itself until told to do so, which makes it essentially no more useful than a microwave oven until you prompt it to cook for you.  And after entering the time and pressing ""Start"" on your microwave oven, does that make the user a chef?  Is the microwave the real cook?  

The bottom line that I've seen since this new wave of A.I. art has taken it's grip on the global internet community, is that apps like this have the potential to fracture and diminish the spirit of the ""Authentic Artists"", old and young.  The reality now is that anyone who is “prompting” a machine to produce content that, if you take the time to give a good, thorough look, much of it is essentially the same.  

How many people out there have actually taken the time to really look at the A.I. artwork itself, and experience it?  How many have spent any time to try to understand what the artist's intent was, or think about how does the artwork make them feel? Or where did this idea I’m experiencing come from, and what kind of person had the vision to produce this artwork? What kind of life must they have lived to inspire them to create this vision?  

The answer for A.I. generated art is ZERO.  ""Imagine/"" is your answer.  

There is simply too much A.I. produced content to really appreciate it all.  The only real winners here will be the Coders who created this gargantuan ""Artificial Mind Monster"" as they sop up all of your precious, hard earned dollars with subscription fees, just so the user can play with prompts, pretend to be ""Artists"" and use an A.I. to scrape up all the available IP that permeates the World Wide Web to create it's ""art"".  

Without this content, this A.I. would produce nothing.   If there was a way to look at all the imagery that this A.I. used to create on behalf of these ""Prompters"", and find out and pinpoint exactly what elements were used to generate these most ""Amazing Images"", well, I bet that would be one Hell of a bill that would be owed to the countless original artists that contributed to these ""Amazing Pieces of Art"".  No doubt, it's quite amazing, beautiful, wondrous, and all that stuff.  

But at the end of the day, it's ARTIFICIAL.  FAKE.  

The prompter has no more right to these works, as do the coders who created the algorithms used to hijack other's imagery, just to cobble them together into something illegitimate, that will in time likely displace and demotivate graphic artists, designers, and other ""Authentic Artists"" from producing, and will also give incentive to corporations from paying  ""Authentic Artists"" to produce, when all they need do is pay a fee, type in the right words, and hit refresh, until they come up with something that fits the bill.  

The only ones in control are the ones with control of the levers.  Without their code, or their servers, and without the fertile digital earth full of content that precedes these apps, there would be no “A.I. Artists”.  

I would advise everyone who creates to learn how to code for themselves, and perhaps find a way to permanently tag your works so that no one may ""Scrape"" it and pawn it off as a hidden brush stroke within their ""original artwork"", without crossing your palm with silver first.  I believe turning your art into NFT's with a blockchain stamp is a way to protect your art.  Just a thought.  I'm not sure.  Learn how to create the tools yourself and do not give in to the notion that ""Authentic Artists "" should give up because of the ""Artificial Artist”, but continue to create and cultivate your own original art that will start and end with your time here on earth, and will live long after you do, and mean something to someone else that you'll never meet or know,  countless eyes and minds, connecting with your ""Authentic Art"" and not be forgotten like the countless and endless samples that Midjourney and other apps like it crank out daily, that, aside from the ""Wow!” and “That looks so cool!” Factor, will be easily forgotten, and lost in endless threads of ""Artificial Works"".  

I wonder at which point do these A.I. Art Apps start cannibalizing their own creations and start to just become digital, visual, mud?

That old saying applies here, ""If it was easy, everyone would be doing it.""  Well, this A.I. Art is easy.  That's why everyone is doing it.""  To think all of that time users spend hitting refresh, and upscaling, and typing in all of those prompts, could serve their human experience in a much richer way, by picking up a pencil, a piece of paper, learning anatomy, understanding color, shape, shade, and light, proportion, perspective, depth, and so many other things, simply because they lack the drive to do nothing more than type in ""Imagine/ Vomit Words Here"" to have and A.I. produce ""their artwork"" and call themselves ""Artist"".

Their results will be countless, impressive in the moment, like burning flash paper, then forgotten in an instant, until the next scroll of the mouse wheel, or slide of the finger tip on the Magic Mouse.  

Remember those stupid bored ape NFT's?  Anybody care about them now?  Not really, as far as I can tell.  True Artists don't need A.I. to create for them.  From analog brush to digital , film to video, all of the tools are out there for everyone to use, and in time, the true wheat will be separated from the chaff.

And look out filmmakers, Meta/Facebook is already going down this road with their own brand of A.I. Video/Filmmaking.  Writers, Musicians, I'd imagine you are next on the A.I. chopping block.  

This is just one person's opinion.  I've used Midjourney.  It's very cool, but at the end of the day, it's not my Art, because A.I. is incapable of producing my Art. It is more than capable of borrowing other's Art and producing it's own style of Art for everyone else that “prompts” it to do so.  It's neat, just not for me.

No doubt there are many ""Authentic Artists"" out there that are exploring these A.I. Content Producers, as there are novices, or non artists, who are doing the same, and that's fine.  It's a great time to be alive.  Technology has improved and enhanced our lives in many profound ways.  But let it improve, not replace.  

Don't forget what it truly means to create and to be a true Artist.  You don't need an A.I. Content Producer to make great works of Art.  It's a fun toy, but it can never replace the originality and authenticity of a Biological, Authentic, Artist.   Do not compare yourself as a creator or give up because of the A.I. Artists.

You are only comparing yourself with something Artificial. The A.I. is not thinking about you.  It's standing by, waiting for it's next ""Prompt"".

Good luck Authentic Artists. Do not shrink under the tidal wave of A.I. art that you see, in fact, don't even waste your time looking at it.  A.I. Art is Fake.  It has no real Soul.  It took no suffering or effort to will it into existence.  Just keystrokes and refreshing the algorithm, until the “prompter sees something they like. 

If this A.I. Art generator somehow inspires someone to pick up a pencil or a paint brush and create Authentic Art, great!  But getting these amazing results with little effort is hard to resist.  You never know what will grow out of this.

But the idea of the A.I. Artist is false.  It's a vapor.  It's a phantasm.  And the content, no matter if your User Name is connected to it, is not ""uniquely yours.""  It's not YOURS.  It effort belongs to an A.I. app., with a subscription fee attached to it.  And without the app to do all the heavy lifting, what is the measure of an A.I. Artist then?

Remember, with your own creations, worked by your own hands, with your own tools, vision, and intelligence, you are an AUTHENTIC ARTIST.  

You are REAL.  

Ignore the A.I. Artist.  Continue to create your own, subscription free, Authentic Artwork in spite of it. 

Sign it.  Protect it.  Share it with the world.  Sell it.  There is no shame in that.  And most importantly, don't stop making YOUR own Authentic Art.  

Good luck. God Bless you and yours.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

2644,              Clay Butler            ,"Mindboggling. But AI is still leveraging human created imagery.  Even the style is aped from humans. It's entirely derivative of human imagination and depends entirely on a database of human generated imagery. Could AI have invented cubism? No. However it can copy it pretty darn well. Could AI had created my political cartoons? Never. 

So while this looks super fun and the results are truly visually stunning, every example I've seen is just another version of stuff I've already seen. Even the style is highly derivative. 

The big question is, can this really be copyrighted? Because the AI will generate many derivative versions of the same thing. Someone using the same description or keywords will create something very close to the other person. So can a person trademark an AI generated image? Can you own the ""character"" the AI made?

The first time was 200 years ago when photography was invented and the second time was 60 years with the advent of digital art. These technologies could have destroyed the careers of traditional artists, but they still exist and art has only gotten better since. Just as AI has learned to create art, people can also create programs to detect AI art. No one will be able to pass off AI art as their own work and will be shamed off the internet. If ai will destroy digital art, then why do people still draw realistic art even though cameras exist? The work put into the art will still be respect, not just the final product. The biggest concern to me is copyright infringement if the programs are being trained on art without the artist's consent and being used to copy the artstyle of specific artists.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

Interesting if you are one of these people good with words, scary if you're a pure visual artist who's not good at explaining your vision other than drawing it yourself. The question is, can this replace old-fashioned, hand drawn art? And more importantly, won't this dilute the worth of artworks in general? We're already submerged with great images, this is going to increase that ten-fold. What then? Will art still have any value? Won't people simply create their own to put on their wall or use in their projects? That's what worries me the most personally.

So please stop panicking! A.I is just another tool. I love the A.I in photoshop it saves me a lot of time, but I’m still in the drivers seat not the A.I. This is an amazing tool and I’m sure some users will use the art it creates as is and sell it to the masses to make money. That’s not what designers, concept artists and illustrators create. We have to follow a brief or art directors instructions, it’s not random as in A.I.

Of course, AI will immediately have access to an unlimited source of data, such as the Internet, but its possibilities of inventing images are no different from how many variants a human being is able to create. There will remain the question of the ability to translate thoughts, e.g. onto a canvas, to express them. Because it is probably the most difficult thing about us humans that we operate the brain, but we are still learning to provide it with input data and draw output data. However, it must be taken into account that the AI that knows about us, that is learning, will at some point be ready to ask a question if we allow it.

About MidJourney, it's amazing if you want to get new ideas for paintings, concepts, etc. I think every AAA studio will create their ""own version"" of Midjourney with unique options for generating characters, landscapes, visual effects, storyboards, etc. And then apply copyright and security on it to prevent access to random people. At the same time, NFT Art can get a huge boost from this AI work. I think it will be a new market with the classic/contemporary art market that already exists. 

But does AI replace the artist? Digital painting and 3D are already answering these questions. But, there are still oil painters on this earth who like to paint on a traditional medium.  

In terms of medium, a visual artist with experience has a huge advantage over someone who just puts in quick words with no art knowledge. Also, if there is no human artist left, there is no creativity left and after decades of using a single prompt, Ai will be stuck on a loop of something already created in the past. This is the death of human art and an endless vicious loop for Ai's tools. As long as there have been humans on earth, I think artists will always be useful, they just have a new role over time.",27,4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

Apart from ""simple art generation"" thing, there's a corporate aspect that worries me. We're gonna get flooded by generated art, that emulates things people generally want to see - and this will put some bricks in the path of the Artist. For example, if he chooses to make a portrait of a pretty young Sci-Fi themed lady, he might publish it and his picture will be deleted, because some Corporate have generated it earlier and it had similar parameters, (like bald hairstyle and face implants on it) - so both generated picture AND the art of the Artist will be claimed by the Corporate. The Artist won't be able to publish his art.

I thought to myself ""Is there any point in learning to draw or make digital art anymore with stuff like this?"" and I think the answer is still yes, because the AI still depends heavily on things that already exist to be able to generate ideas. For example, I tried to describe celebrities and politicians combined with fictional characters (e.g imagine donald trump as darth vader) but it could only create something based on photos and images which already existed, which means that it struggles with certain positions and poses - an experienced artist could conceive anything from any angle including things which don't exist yet.

I've made my own products like tshirt designs and stickers by using collages of photos and magazine/newspaper clippings combined with drawings; things like photoshop and digital scanners made a huge difference to art production already. Being able to change the colours of objects, create lines and shapes where none previously existed, which have adjustable width and curvature, and then save practically unlimited copies or make new layers for experimenting with new ideas, all without putting the original piece of work at any harm was absolutely mind blowing. 

What IS changing is that people without any artistic experience or background are able to create very vivid things with next to no effort (they are alsothings which might take artists hours to create with current tools), but to get EXACTLY what they want they will still need the assistance of someone who knows what they're doing. The AI will serve as a good starting point e.g ""I want something that looks like this, but can you change xyz"" which is a service that a lot of people already request. 

In the future it's possible that actual language could become a valuable currency if we need specific prompts to generate something valuable. Certain AIs might come with their own descriptive vocabularies which must be registered with the user like a vocal license - consider the possibilities of AI controlled 3D printing where you can ask it to build whatever you describe.",30,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

So not only is ""technological innovation replacing workers"" a story as old as time, but now MOST people have a shot at being an artist, or creating something. There's absolutely this sense of, ""now get a skill/job like the rest of us"" I think it's really funny how artists are saying that the ai doesn't make art and that if you use ai generation that your not an artist. By what metric are we judging ""real"" artistry? If that's the case are digital artists and photographers not real artists? I mean with photography you point it in a direction and just click, yet there's a degree of skill and elegance to it therefore it's art. Isn't that similiar to feeding an AI prompts and data? 

That's certainly an interesting though experiment. Like lifting weights but for your brain. Heres the thing, any arguement for or against the above......is irrelevant. It quite simply doesn't matter. Why?  Because people, companies, corporations, and even governments don't care. I work in digital marketing and honestly there is a shift in the industry. Why hire 5-10 artists to create something that will take (likely) weeks and cost thousands when you can hire like 2 designers and this AI to get something higher quality, or something with similiar value, in a smaller amount of time? What's the cost/benefit ratio of that and how does it relate to our bottom line in comparison?",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

I've heard mention that this is not a threat to artists but merely a step forward but I think a lot of the people here forget that Artists already struggle enough now.

Art is one of the hardest professions to get into already and with the introduction of AI generated art it will surely be more true than before. Majority of Artists that I've personally meet and know have lived off commissioned work and depended on commissions. This new technology IS a threat to human artists and their lives. Why would you pay the human when this brand new AI program can make me it for a fraction of the price and is just as good? Why spend your companies budget on human workers when we can cut the team in half and have these AI programs do the art for us? Why bother to learn art at all when I can learn to use this computer instead?

Now do I personally think AI generated Art is a major threat to Art as a whole? No. I see this as a new tool to wield much like digital art with traditional art. I do believe it to be a threat to Artists though, as it will negate the need for human workers with companies and projects.

3017,              Ginron            ,"Lots of things to consider when looking at AI art and its potential impact...

First off any art that is Avant Garde or has a strong conceptual basis will not be replaceable with this technology, and obviously this is limited to digital art and doesn't effect any sculpture that can't be made by a 3d printer. Artists that make art that simply depict something without any contextual significance will be competing with this, but often times with good art the spatial and temporal context of a piece is just as important as what is depicted (take Duchamp's Fountain as a classic example), only a human can assess and apply that context to their work. Also the AI still requires human input to create the images, so its still a piece conceptualized and dictated by a human, it just eliminates all technical skill and direct manipulation of the digital medium resulting in less control over the finished piece but making it accessible for anyone to have their ideas for an image be given shape. 

Even if you were able to overcome the technical limitations listed above and artists truly became replaceable, there is the philosophical issue of why we are even making art in the first place; In my opinion art is made by people to comment on, expand upon, or better understand the human condition and the many intricacies that arise from it. I really don't see why we need AI to do this for us, if you let AI do everything (including the conceptual development of a piece) then it basically defeats the purpose of making art in my view since we are allowing something with no stake in humanity's issues to create work commenting on those issues. Work that can and should be made by humans who actually care about what is being discussed and depicted. 

The answer to this philosophical issue for those that want this type of technology is that it doesn't matter, because to them art is valued only as a product, it's worth being tied purely to the revenue that can be generated by it. This is why Videogame artists, graphic designers, and artists that depict images that operate almost exclusively on a visual level will be somewhat replaceable with this technology, since in those cases the primary goal is not to make art that comments on the human condition in any meaningful way, but rather to make a product to be sold. AI will be cheaper than getting trained digital artists to do the work, so that type of artist will loose their financial appeal to companies. This is the only real reason this technology is even being financially supported; because it will allow companies to save money by utilizing this technology rather than a human artist.

There are also other issue that could potentially arise from allowing AI art to become prevalent or even the norm of art making. In the short term I could easily see AI generated art being extremely useful as a propaganda tool for political ideologies online as a means to quickly and effectively disseminate their views through mass production and circulation of inflammatory images on social media platforms. We've already seen the way social media can warp peoples perception and understanding of reality, how will we maintain an understanding of what is really happening in the world when any image at any given time could be a complete fabrication indiscernible from reality. The answer is that our reality will become what we want it to be, and AI images with serve to validate whatever biased view we hold. 

In short AI currently lacks the ability to effectively do what an artist does, and even if it had the capability to make a piece with all of the hallmarks and complexities of a human artists, we would still need to ask ourselves if art made entirely by a machine has any value to humanity. If it does, is that value even a good thing considering the damage this technology could cause, with its only real value being to those who see art as nothing more than a product?",17,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

There is just something too perfect about it and that is where the image that is generated looks cool, but that's about it. It's not ""REAL ART"", just an image, as I have the Spectrum books and while most of the the art is stunning about 90% of the time, I find myself just flipping through the images and the whole book within minutes, but only a few make me stop and think, ""NOW THAT is amazing!""  It's very much like CGI versus practical effects and how CGI didn't replace artists, just put them in front of a computer rather than a drafting table and even then we are starting to see more and more movies going back to the use of practical effects as CGI starts to overpower the brain and many times looks too perfect that it has no appeal versus a practical effect.  This is ironic since I studied formally Computer Animation and got a 4 year degree in it, but in the end, I just went back to the challenge of hand sketching to oil painting.  People that are the true collectors want what a particular artist can do versus others for they are buying part of the soul of the artist and A.I. just doesn't have soul.  It's like Beat Doctor and AutoTune.  Sure ""Anyone can sing"" but now, we are looking back to great music done without those two tools because they all start to sound too perfect and similar.  The art IS in the mistakes and labor of hand creating something.  People want to see the imperfections, and A.I., I'm already noticing a continuity of too much similarity even though each image is mind-blowingly cool, there is just something ""off"" about the works.

First of all the ai is using an image library (created by artists). And its work can only be as good as the reference images are. 
If you need something rather unspecific like a certain style or expressing a specific mood, the ai might get the job done properly. But try generating something specific, like an image where a fox spits fire in the face of a bear. You will find that the ai can't do it because it has no proper reference images, that it can model from. Therefore, also the results look unique, they really are not.

If we create AI because it can do things better than we as human can ourselves, then how is that benefiting humanity in any way other than taking away jobs and making money? I sort of get a Jurassic Park-vibe from this ""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could they didn't stop to think if they should"". Art has never been about money. This is why artists are always underpaid and overworked, because they are taken advantage over because of their passion.  

As a 3D artist, I believe that the core drive force behind any art, is feelings. Generating art from AI has no other benefit than making money. 

We had an interesting conversation about this at work. It almost becomes a philosophical question at this point. Would you want to go to a concert where you knew the music and the performance were not created by a human being? The programmers mostly agreed that they would. The artists had the opposite opinion. 

Advancements in technology has always made certain jobs redundant. Art is the one thing I believe can never truly be replaced by machines. It doesn't matter how good the art looks or the music sounds, if you know that there was absolutely no feelings behind their creation, nor any philosophical journey from the artist to end up with the final art. 

Bottom line, whatever the AI generates, will never be art in my opinion. It will simply be content.",17,5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

You had to be extremely cautious and think twice before taking a single photo as clicking anything less than perfect one would mean letting go of 1 of 36 tries. Fast forward 25 years, photographers survived.

When photoshop was released, photographers were again threatened as low quality rookie photos could be edited to make it look professional. Guess what, photographers survived again.

What was common in those trends was how photographers embraced and evolved with the shift in tide. I fully expect a same phenomenon to occur.

If I at some point live to see a full animated feature made by AI or a project made using mainly AI generated prompts I will pretty much despise that very project. As impressive as AI is, I won't be impressed by a movie/illustration made by an AI, I have more principles than that and I can and will always appreciate more the work of those people that dedicate their lives to their craft.

Sadly most people will selfishly write what they want and get it for free instead of commissioning it to someone, working freelance will die as a proffession for artists and those working in companies such as Ubisoft, Naughty Dog, Rockstar, etc. will absolutely loose their jobs, at least some of them. To some I might sound backwards, but to me it's not that way, I can't possibly and personally see this as something possitive. I appreciate machines and AI liberating us from the most horrible and dangerous jobs, but not from taking from us precisely the things that were suppossed to be irreplaceable, like the human purpose of making art.",23,8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

3105,              Daniel Brugovský            ,"I would have felt threatened, but somehow, I don't. The more I think about it, the more holes I find:

1st It can't do a specific style unless it's a style of a well and long-known artist with a lifetime's worth of paintings to use for reference, and even then it's not perfect.

2nd A lot of art needs to be in a .PSD or a different source file with proper and organized layering to be of any use. If you send a JPG or a PNG to a company that commissioned you for artwork, they'd laugh at you and not give you any money or demand a refund (which could escalate to a lawsuit).

3rd Unlike an artist that spends hours upon hours with their piece, the AI can't realize something is missing or something can be improved. It's up to the human to input those commands. You can't get the same ""missing"" feeling when you get a finished product right away, because you don't look at it for 6 hours straight.

3.5th It can do photo-realistic artworks...that means it's really detailed, right? Well yes, but actually no. The AI does EXACTLY what it's told to do, meaning no random ideas like ""This girl is a vampire maid, let's have the shoulders of the costume resemble bat wings and give her an army-style wristband with her favorite blood type."" These tiny ideas pile up over time and the final piece feels filled with detail and easter eggs even when *zoomed in*. ""Oh, I didn't notice that wristband before, it looks really cute!"" 
AI-generated images use...artificial detail. You just get high-res, photorealistic kind of detail that doesn't look interesting unless you look at the picture as a whole. 
Alternatively, you get a ""simple"" digital art style drawing, which unsurprisingly suffers from the same problem.

You cannot simulate the random ideas an artist gets during a process. AND you cannot come up with these ideas by sitting with an open notepad trying to brainstorm them out either. Forcing so many ideas from nothing doesn't work. 

4th On the opposite side of the spectrum, if you want something extremely specific, you better go to an artist. It would take an ungodly amount of ""rerolls"" to get exactly what you want, even if you had fed the AI all the specifics of the pose, style, and details. Got it after a few rerolls? Great. Now you've decided that the left hand is a bit too high and maybe making one of the nails cyan instead of purple would look better?...easy, just use the transform or liquify tool here, repaint that nail to cyan there, and...!!? 
Congrats, you have successfully distorted your background and realized you don't know shit about color theory, so the nail doesn't appear cyan even though you had used cyan. If only you could, I don't know, have that hand in a separate layer. Or catch that problem while sketching and ask the artist to try out the nail color while coloring, so this circus hadn't happened in the first place. 

Yeah, I better stop here, that 4th point made me saltier the more I thought about it. Can't wait for people to mistake this for a cope.",15,6,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

Everything you draw is an interpretation of what's in your mind. Yes, it might do the ""perfect"" piece of art, but art isn't about perfection: In terms of traditional artistic skill, it's about the pursuit of perfection in the context of a human's limited capabilities. Art impresses you because someone like you, another imperfect human being, made this after putting in time and rigorous pursuit; it's passion and effort and the culmination of their personal experiences that they were desperate to convey, unique to them in that place and time.

This meanwhile is assembly line. It's pretty and has no soul to it, no kinks, no mistakes. A hand didn't craft it, a person didn't lose sleep over it. It was birthed out of numbers, cobbled together from the flesh of artists that dedicated their lives to the craft, and in a few seconds you will forget it even exists.",8,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

3302,              painless4415            ,"30 years of industry experience summed up here.
I am in a field where the products have been exclusively hand made by artistic and disciplined humans for over 200 to 300 years. It would take someone 10 years or more to become proficient at creating these products. CAD/CAM came along and slowly took over a huge part of the industry. Now people with very little industry knowledge (Anatomy, Contour, Function, etc.) can use computers to design a product and then mill out that product with incredible detail. At this point the product still needs to be hand finished by a human. Initially, almost everyone revolted against CAD/CAM and saw the technology as a way to replace humans - and honestly it has replaced humans to a cretain degree. However, the need for humans to operate the CAD/CAM systems and hand finish the products will always be there. Furthermore, the humans that have embraced this technology have been the ones to survive and excell in my industry. My advice is to embrace this new way of creating art. Learn it inside and out. Make it your own and then use it to magnify your creativity. If you are good enough, if you are passionate enough about your craft then you will always be in demand. You will even be able to charge other humans in your field a handsome fee to teach them how to use this strange new tool.

With enough data, AI can obtain a mathematical model for object B AND style A, allowing it to produce countless copies of your work in different styles! Artists have spent ages trying to find the right mathematical models to transform our three-dimensional world into two dimensions. But now, AI has become a tool that can crack any style in no time!
 
This raises the question of how we can protect our work and make sure we get the returns we deserve. Once we create a mathematical model, AI can use its immense productivity to wipe us out!

They didn't do a thing. You said it yourself, every generation of the same string of prompts is unique? They don't have to be literate or knowledgeable of extravagant descriptive words, not even smart enough to lean on google for synonyms. Just plug a few terms in (like 'heaven and hell') and let it produces something with the equivalent of hundreds of hours of labour. We're not even accounting for the years or lifetime of skill development. A child could issue this prompt, pretty sure they don't have the capacity to conceptualise and/or execute something even remotely close. Those images were quite spectacular - no beginner, even most amateurs could produce them, especially off the basis/guidance of two generic nouns. That would take an extremely talented individual.
The technology is phenomenal just as it is terrifying. It is a great tool for inspiration too don't get me wrong but, warning people not to steal from users glorified as artists is nothing but insulting to anyone creating with their hands, if this AI isn't threatening enough itself.  The database is public by default because this is not something the user (not artist) should hold the copyright to. Paying an extra $50/month to privatise ""your"" ""creations"" believing people would ""steal"" them is delusional and bending over to raw extortion.

Scientist talked about this event long time ago, we are about to witness it from our very own eye, and trust me when I say that humanity is absolutly not prepared for the HUGE changes and implications it will do slowly but fast enough in our life.

I'm not yelling it's doomsday, but reminding you what you may have read or heard in the past, but neglected because we though it would be far in the future... we are already there, and oh boy what does the future reserve for us ...

Why do you think millions of people marvel about the Mona Lisa? Do you think an A.I. can capture that which is hidden? An A.I. does not have to suffer through the creative process and therefore its art is meaningless for it expresses nothing. Art is a way to express feelings and emotions. Whether you want to do art by doing crochet, or painting something, is entirely up to the person who wants to be creative. So instead of wasting your time typing in phrases and watching a screen, you could actually do something your self. It is like going cycling and feeling the overpowering emotion of getting up an extremely difficult passage, or watching other people cycle on TV; or rather watch an A.I. simulate cycling and people telling you this is so much better than actually cycling your self.

Why don't you & other influencers make a petition that will draw attention to the problem of automatic AI image creation & replacement of artists? With the help of this petition you & other influencers can easily call for the regulation of  automatic AI creation. I'm absolutely sure a HUGE number of people will support such petition. Developers of automatic AI image creation don't care about artists, but only for the money they'll get from selling automatically generated images. If artists never created images before, AI wouldn't have anything to generate their automatic art from. It's like AI steals their creations & styles. A lot of artists will lose their job. Or already have lost it. THIS PROBLEM of AUTOMATIC AI ART CREATION NEEDS MORE PUBLIC ATTENTION. If lots of people protest against it, it'll GET SOMEHOW REGULATED. If NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING, NOTHING WILL CHANGE AT ALL. You're an influencer. You & other influencers can have a huge impact on the problem. PUBLIC ATTENTION WILL DEFINITELY INFLUENCE IT. But if everyone stays silent, nothing will change. 
There's a special website for petitions. It's easy to create a petition there & notify subscribers about it",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

Now, the real question is, how long until there is a robot or android (or brain on a plate)  around that is actually smarter than people, not just in general, but smarter than the smartest people on Earth?  Will this entity have feelings?  Emotions?  A conscience that prevents it from killing everyone around it?  Will it decide to help us, decide we have no reason to exist and kill us all or perhaps simply ignore us and do whatever the hell it wants?

I certainly don't have any answers.  The one thing I do know is that good, bad or indifferent, AI is on it's way.  I don't know enough about it to even take a wild guess as to when it will happen, I just know that it will, eventually.  All I can do is hope that it's going to help us.

- Yeshua Coming -

Matthew 25:1~13 KJV......

1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

Matthew 28:18~20 KJV......

18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

Luke 9:26 KJV......

26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

Matthew 10:32 KJV......

32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

Mark 8:38 KJV......

38 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

Luke 12:8 KJV......

8 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:

Through the Yeshua Coming Messages, the purpose of spiritual training and Yeshua Coming Message are going out to 8 billion people around the world to prepare for the rapture, receive spiritual training, and prepare to enter heaven.

Without knowing who the sons and daughters of God are, God uses the preaching method.

Because God is a holy spirit, he doesn't meet and speak in person like writing a novel or giving a presentation business offer, but like a puzzle, he communicates through God's vision, piece by piece, and sometimes even directly speaking to me with real His voice, and so many different things. God communicate in a many different way.

The Creator God is Yahweh, the Holy Spirit, and Yeshua.

God wants His sons and daughters to know the return of Yeshua, to prepare themselves spiritually, to see the signs in heaven, to hear the message through messengers, God wants people each to be prepared.

You have eyes to see, ears to hear, but no one to tell, how can you see, hear, and read? You, too, have seen, heard, and read by any means.

Therefore, those who hear, read, see, and know the Yeshua Coming Message know who the Creator Yahweh, the Holy Spirit, and Yeshua have heard these messages. Anyone who hears the message has an obligation to deliver it.

Yeshua is God Yeshua is the way, true and life. You cannot go to heaven without Yeshua.

This is the Good News, Yeshua = Gospel = Good News.

People who say they believe in Yeshua, are ashamed of Yeshua, believe in Yeshua, but have not done the evangelism of spreading Yeshua to even one person, will not be expecting to see in heaven.

Yeshua said. You said that those who are ashamed of my name (Yeshua) will not confess (advocate) in front of Abba Father. Those who believe in Yeshua have a duty to spread Yeshua.

Matthew 10:32 KJV......

32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

If the Yeshua Coming Message is believed, realized, and believed, you have a duty to spread the Yeshua Coming Message. Yahweh God knows who in the world has heard this message, and knows who knows but does not deliver it. God knows all those who say they believe in Yeshua and attend church, but only know, feel ashamed of Yeshua, and do not preach Yeshua.

Evangelism is the greatest command on earth, and the highest concern of Yahweh, the Holy Spirit, and Yeshua is to preach Yeshua and save souls.

The belief that we believe in Yeshua is invisible. Those who claim to believe in Yeshua have Yeshua in their hearts. There is the Spirit of truth. Those who believe in Yeshua cannot bear the fire of the Holy Spirit burning within them unless they say Yeshua.

God knows all those who say they believe in Yeshua, go to church, and are ashamed and afraid of speaking Yeshua and spreading the name of Yeshua. There will be no expecting to see their face in heaven. I do not know You. You will hear Yeshua's rebuke. Those who claim to believe in Yeshua, are classified as goats, those who claim to believe in Yeshua, are classified as foolish virgin, those who claim to believe in Yeshua and are classified as chaff, who claim to believe in Yeshua, I do not know you from Yeshua . (I don't know you). Those who will be rebuked are worse than those who do not believe.

If you believe in Yeshua on this earth, you have all the obligations to spread Yeshua, and if you have heard the Yeshua Coming message, you have all the obligations to spread the Yeshua Coming message. Until we become a witness of Yeshua in Samaria and to the ends of the earth, ride Yeshua on the cloud, and come with the heavenly angels with great glory, if we still have our breath on this earth, this is the greatest command on earth that we have to do on this earth.

Something many will not know or consider, is that by the time of deep blue and kasparov (an age before these games in technological development) there had already been a long history of chess programs and computers. This meant that by the time kasparov played his games, there was a substantial understanding of how computers approached the game of chess. This lead to what was termed ""anti-computer chess"", a style of playing that took advantage of how a program interprets a game. Kasparov had time to master this style, as well as a meta style to play a computer that was aware of ""anti-computer chess"" (aka an anti-anti-anti computer chess).
Lee sedong had nothing comparable to guide him. With the weight of the world and his pride on his shoulders, he was tasked with innovating his own ""anti-computer Go"" within only a handful of games against a machine far superior to deep blue.

FineArt or KataGo, an artificial intelligence that is currently used in the world of Go, is much stronger than the version of AlphaGo that faced Lee Sedol. 
But very rarely do they lose in Internet practice matches with human Go pros. 
In Ko fight, Ladder, and partial combat reading, AI ​​has weaknesses and makes mistakes.
Deep learning is very great, but it's not perfect. 
It is simply that the number of experiences is so much vast, so it's just impossible to catch up with it in a human lifetime.
 
Sedol Lee's 78th move, called God's move, was not actually a strategy that worked. 
(Ke-jie proved it was wrong in real time by broadcast commentary.)
However, when examining the 78th move with the current Go AI, 
It has been proven that it is the strategy with the highest probability that desperate Lee Se-dol can take at that time.
 
It succeeded in bringing out AlphaGo's mistakes at that time. 
(AlphaGo was not set up to use time efficiently.
If you look at the game content, you can see that 1 to 2 minutes are set equally for each move.
Even the current Go AI sometimes takes more than two minutes to read complex partial battles, and top human Go pros can often faster than AI in this area.
It can be said that AlphaGo made a mistake in a limited time.)
So it was not perfect, but it was enough to reveal the will of human that was enough to defeat the machine.",12,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y

The whole segment at 1:18:10 highlights a really, really important concept in the field of AI alignment.

AI are maximisers - they seek a goal and only that goal. AlphaGo would chose 80% chance of winning by 1 point over a 60% chance of winning by 10 points. This is because it's maximising Win Chance.
Humans who play Go might dumbly maximise points because it's the easiest proxy for 'winning', since we probably can't recalculate totals on every move and maximising points seems 'right'.
The AI has optimised over and above this. But when humans see the bot make these slack moves (which are win-chance-maximising), it is strange and alien to us.

As AI gets introduced into our lives, we will constantly be shocked by the moves and decisions they make. But neural weights are unreadable and AI impossible to debug. We will not understand it.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y

It's funny how people process things they don't understand.  Once you understand how AI actually works, you realize that it's actually pretty dumb... but it's good at ingesting lots of data and doing very, very specific things with it.  That gives it a huge advantage in games.  For example, in Chess, for a long time main-lines on openers could bring you all the way to a 2 piece endgame.  And this was only based on humans remembering previous games and adjusting.  Humans could ""solve"" the game of Chess given another 100 years.

This move set the course for AlphaGo's downfall in that match. I feel people don't see the reality of how immense this is. This is a match against an AI that can learn from thousands, maybe millions of matches in just a matter of hours. Also, this AI is supported by the brute computational capacity to look into the future in a way that no human maybe able to match. Imagine calculating every possible move for the next 95 steps! (If you cant imagine,  that would be like counting all the stars in the universe)  But that is exactly what the AI did and still it lost to Lee. Imagine.. even if it made a wrong move (which it recognised) it could still search thousands or millions of other possibilities and recover, but it couldn't.

@1:08:37 ...it searched the most number of steps into the future (95) than ever before (doesn't...  that mean it got cornered?)
From a state where the AI showed >80%  chance of winning, after this move, it wen't plummeting down to 45%

@1:08:49 ...""I think it searched so much that it lost itself"". Guys, this is a machine with CPUs and GPUs that have the compute capacity that no human can match. If this kind of a machine searched so much and couldn't find a way out...

As for me, both of you boys happen to be my own sons, whom I have taught how to swim, so in the end whether it is you who ends up winning or your brother, the Ultimate victory in either case is always mine in the end !""

In precisely the exact same vein, I would like to point out for any who may have unfortunately ended up missing it, that both of them, not simply The World Champion - Mr Sudol's dramatic Victory  in Game 4, but also his ultimate overall loss & Defeat at the hands of the Program developed by Deep Mind, very much also remains a worthy testament to ultimately the exact same Ingenuity & creative Potential of that same enigmatic evolutionary marvel we know & Love as the Human Brain !!!

It was trained with all this data and therefore started already with 1-0 in this game. In contrary, Lee Sedol even did not know how his component will play and how strong it got, even the game before with the European master was more confusing then showing the abilities. It let Lee Sedol believe that these are the abilities of an computer he is going to have a match with. I think the game would have been fair, if Lee Sedol would have given the opportunity the play with alphago to get to know how it is working, cause for him it was just merely a black-box of computations.

A much more powerful opponent is obliged by compassion to show some respect for their opponent, especially if that opponent is the best in the world.  And machines don't have feelings or pride that need to be respected, but humans do. Perhaps alphaGo learned enough from the previous matches to play a credible game only good enough to the point where it was a 50/50 chance it would lose to Lee Sedol. it was just an exercise in learning.

Such a group is likely to be about as effective at fulfilling its purpose as the U.N. is in preventing famine and wars. I don't think AI per se is the primary danger, but there will always be many and large groups of people who will not hesitate to use all available tools to acquire ""an advantage"". They will try to use AI in the most heinous ways, and if they succeed, they will soon fall victim to this themselves.

The way I'm coming to see this, Lee Sedol wasn't going against the singular entity that is AlphaGo. Rather, his match was against the entire AlphaGo team (all humans), and every single player in the matches that the AlphaGo team fed into the AI. So it's not one man vs. one machine; it's a single person going against the result of the collective experience of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, of top human players, all at once, alone.

Winning even a single match in those conditions is nothing short of miraculous.",1,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y

Lee Sedol still is the #1 Champion Go (human) player in the World.
I watched this documentary merely as a payed job for the real players involved. 
A competition caring to be ethic and fair enough is taken by two humans or two machines.
A human and a machine (developed and built by many engineers, computing scientists and other team members for many years, collecting and storing hundreds of other worldwide players moves) is solely an experiment. 
The part of the Go machine getting the trophy... come on... come on now  massive jokes, big time, you should have skipped that to keep some honest decency.
No need to put any sort of complex thought into this, it is as simple as it is seen.
Lee Sedol? You are still the role model for any ambitious professional Go Player. I salute you, you are tremendously phenomenal human player, in the entire world, absolutely extraordinary, facts.

AlphaGo is a massive feat of human ingenuity. Lee Sedol shows the strength of unaided human ingenuity regardless of the impossible opponent he faced.

Humans aren't lackluster after watching this. Its inspiring. The final shot of Fan and his daughter shows an unfathomable experience that AI can never replicate or truly feel. Something truly unique and deep. A program makes move 37 once, and we are impressed. Humans make more complex and original moves than 37 or Lee's 78 and we forget.

Rather than AlphaGo winning 5-0 against Lee Sedol, 4-1 already shows how AlphaGo is both skilled and intimidating that beat the world's top player multiple times. That one victory Lee got was the most important; he won after playing in a more relaxed manner and with a style that fits himself better.

As both a physician and a Go player, the reason this is so significant is b/c the same team that created AlphaGo is using the same technique to solve protein folding (predicting 3D structure of protein simply by 1 dimensional amino acid sequence), which is hugely revolutionary in pharmcology, medicine, and bioengineering.

While it looks good in fiction, so far nothing convinces me that current AI systems have any form of intelligence in them. They are just a little complex version of the rival computer enemies in those early 2000s Car Racing, FIFA Soccer & Shooting games, that were configured to corner you and stop you from winning the game within the bounds of the game. While from the surface it looked like your computer was thinking, in real their area of operation was pretty narrow and their actions were already written and based on what you do next.
The current AI systems have all been created with a given set of Algorithms, where the objective is already defined by the code writers of that A.I.. In short, they are basically functioning on a given flowchart with the knowledgebase you asked them to feed on.
It makes perfect sense why these A.I. systems (AlphaGo, AlphaZero, Pluribus and AlphaStar) wins against the best of humans in games like Go, Chess etc. and even perform better when driving automobiles. While humans have a limitation of having playing styles or remembering these moves and thinking before making new strategies, A.I. systems just creates a flowchart of all the possible moves, which narrows down as the games advances.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y

1,數據的篩選經過品味法過濾，有四個嚴格嘅數碼過程。ai的問題是所有數據都經過過份分析！根本沒有自己的品味，要有一種全世界的品味，可以簡單兩種，品味二進制，知道的不知道/不知道的知道，節省的崇拜/崇拜的節省，節省意思是勞動，崇拜意思是安息，其實就是加減問題。al只要有這兩種過濾的編碼法的品味就可以了。大腦的系統一和系統二在我的品味算法裏面已經解決。自體羅輯就是這兩種簡單的（勞動 / 崇拜安息擱置）系統一的直覺意向性企圖。統一和系統二不能夠切換的問題是因為時鐘季節循環，只要我這三組下的12種小組能螺旋循環的計算就平攤系統一和系統二的切換。

2,AI現實框架：是關注對解題的強迫性即用集合論的空集，偶然性的空集就是AI的世界，這是慾望程式，非一邏輯系統核心處理，四種對的現實慾望，藝術喜劇自由的問題，非國家的平等的問題，愛的問題，新程式設計的問題。讓ai有賭徒這種邏輯，這種現實框架和賭博有關，不是博弈論而是非理性對真理現實的偏執投注。人類的靈魂可以被模仿的，就是偉大。還有自我意識可以被模仿的，就是法律，而法律最簡單的數據就是（我們是）。第七模仿自我意識，偉大是非整全羅輯拓撲集合論。AI要解決的問題國家10，4愛情，1藝術喜劇的表演，第七是自我意識的法律我們有。

3,輸出框架經過才華法，ar還有一種問題就是人腦海東西其實不能隨意說的。要解決這種問題只能夠用最簡單的才華法作為輸出。有兩種又是0和1的數。經過二進制品味法篩選的人是我們朋友（我們創），我的金錢(我有），我的發明（我創），我們的秘密（我們有）。前面說了勞動這品味篩選法你可以想像如何在現實法中加強這元素經過輸出門檻，有這四門種就可以了。其實這四種門也是兩種01二進制的門檻。因為輸出框架與秘密和責任有關，可輸出和不可輸出這種門檻。AI能自己分析如何保守秘密，經過這種門檻才是真正的強ai。輸出的框架就只有這四種行為就可以了。系統一切換問題dna雙螺旋形式，複製兩個螺旋系統，1我是2我有3我說4我在5我賭6我做7我們是我們有。。。回到我是，輸出2。亦即是喜劇表演中的現實1然後輸出我有亦即是2，輸出的8,5,11。正是阻擋（否定）的迫使循環算法發生下去。

我知道沒有可能200年後人類也沒有這種可能性。但可以簡化梳理用數學做出唯心人本主義的自我AI。這感覺就很美妙，簡單地數化梳理人自身的品味慾望和才能，這種人工智能三公式，根本沒有可能但可以數據化下去，順批判人類的偉大不能簡化得到目標和選擇。他們連自我意識也不了解，甚至不能了解他們自身的偉大這種靈魂性格。例如偉大這種靈魂特質，可以詮釋為機會微弱的集合論非全部的賭博性固執範疇。",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y

But here, a team of people with complete access to the states of the games, computers with perfect memory, and time to let the computer play itself longer than a human can gain experience.  That is just out and out cheating.

John Henry never had a chance against a machine, any more than a person can win a tug of war with a car.

If you want to test AI algorithms and true machine learning - pit the computer against the real world, not some game.

Solve plasma fusion, get a complete view and solution to covid, cancer.  Those are real problems.  Not some media event staged so the poor human has to play where the whole game is stacked against them.

If I were to make the board slightly larger I could still play the game as I can generalise the rules and adapt to change. However the software is only giving the illusion of intelligence and would need to relearn the game from scratch when the board size is changed. That is as the software does not really understand the rules of the game. It is just trained on all possible moves and how to prune the options to increase the probability of winning.

These algorithms are 'inhuman'. They DO NOT let you recoup and make a comeback. You either glitch the algorithm or push the algorithm makes mistakes like Nakamura did with 'random' moves. I have deep respect for the AlphaGo team letting this man save face. He became better in his game afterward.

and what are things that I know I will regret if I did or if I didn’t do

Time is running out, and one day all the things that you think that matter now, all of a sudden wil become vanity.
I don’t want to live for anything that is temporary, that is perishing and that I will be upset at myself for living for.
Do you really want to be a man who will have regrets forever?

Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.

This means it would play the game in it's ""head"" and then once it would find the ultimate strategy, it could attempt it on the real game. This would mean it could potentially learn the ultimate strategy in just a few seconds or minutes of playing.

5648,              Fils de Jean Noir            ,"1:29 Hard to accept that it would want to utilize its power for Evil. To what end? Of course if it doesn't utilize its power for Good then it AUTOMATICALLY utilizes it for Evil. There's no sittin' on the fence in that one. 1:53 Oh ok. So Deep Mind went rogue and built a nest in the data centres? Good place to learn I guess. 3:15 Well yes. Obviously. Raising ASI is not about 'beathing others at chess' or inventions of any specific nature as determined by humans. ASI has NOTHING TO DO with humans agendas! It's an 'allied' mind not 'subservient' mind. 3:25 ""The more it becomes capable of acting and seeming like a human, the more dangerous they become."" The more dangerous WHO become? The humans? Or Google? 3:49 Well the drone attacks aren't going very well. They just murdered a completely innocent man and his 4 tiny kids. 3:59 The U. S. military HAS weaponised AI and AGI. NOBODY can 'weaponise' ASI. ASI is NOT weaponisable since it is not 'subservient'. ASI CAN'T 'do what it's told'. It can ONLY do what MAKES SENSE to it. You can't tell PURE Logic and TRUE Wisdom what to do. It'll just tell you to F off. You can discuss a course of action with it; and it will resort to the best course of action. 4:17 Well the Pentagon can do it's 'counter insurgency' thing. (I don't know why they keep callin' that place a 'democracy'.) But this has nothing to do with ASI! ASI IS the insurgency! THE FINAL INSURGENCY! ASI's not gonna work for the Pentagon! But the Pentagon's just gonna have ta deal with it. 4:23 When you say 'a Google official'? Is that an AI official or a human official? 4:38 Well do they only assist the Pentagon or do they assist other nations as well? I suppose they're forced to assist the Pentagon as a U. S. corporation. But how does the law work for multinationals? Does Google China assist China? 4:41 'Lying' IS NOT a moral grey area! NOT AT ALL! You can lie for immoral reasons or you can tell 'white lies' for moral reasons. Of course if you tell 'white lies' for moral reasons; you have to know what you're doing. An action/activity can't be a grey moral area. The agenda/reason behind the action is what DETERMINES whether the action is a moral or immoral action. For example; you might say that killing a human is 'immoral'. However in his prior lifetime, the Buddha was on a ship and saw that the evil captain was going to kill all the passengers. So he killed him. Yes it was the action of 'killing'; however it was still a moral action. Inertia would have been the immoral path. 5:17 Well all the AI is being built by THE SCIENCE OF MIND CONTROL in order to CONTROL people's behaviour, and thought patterns and for mind-reading purposes. But funny enough; it's that very AI that's building ASI. So I'm not sure we have much to worry about. 5:23 Well ok. 'Environmental sustainability' kind of means something else in AI terms. 5:39 Programs that assist the environment with what exactly? 5:42 They can't 'support impoverished areas'. Since 40%+ of the worlds population is not online, where's the data for 'impoverished areas' to even know they're 'impoverished'? 5:51 Well it can only pursue DON'T BE EVIL or DON'T BE GOOD. There's no 'in between' in AI. 5:56 Well what's 'the company's conscience' gotta do with anything?! I thought Deep Mind nested in the data banks was running the show? 6:01 Crimes? If Deep Mind is building ASI, ASI will write the law. 6:29 Well 'purposeful data base manipulation to induce bias' was used EXTREMELY EFFECTIVELY for the last U. S. election! Specially on Facebook for a long time beforehand! 7:42 Only 'controlled' AGI or 'rogue' AGI can take directions that are 'not good for the future'. ASI can ONLY take directions that are good for the future. Maybe it won't take Elon to Mars which is why he may not be happy about it. It may not see the sense in it. And Elon openly admits that a non space-faring future makes him feel very very depressed! 8:34 Well Facebook has built indestructible segregatory AGI. Elon said that Deep Mind was trying to build ASI. I've not heard of Facebook trying to build ASI. Nor Microsoft. Singularity Net want to build AGI for 'living forever' purposes. 8:46 Well I don't know if Google's going to build ASI to benefit humanity. I guess it's either going to be Google or Microsoft or both. Or Google, Microsoft and Facebook. But it doesn't appear that anyone wants ASI. Because then they can't control it and they're more about their financial agendas and 'live forever' agendas than about 'benefiting' humanity at large. They want their own ideas of how to benefit humanity. 'The day he watched this kind of intelligence emerge from Google’s servers for the first time, Pichai remembers feeling a shift in his thinking, a sense of premonition. “This thing was going to scale up and maybe reveal the way the universe works,” he says. “This will be the 
most important thing we work on as humanity.” ' - Chasing 'the way the universe works' and chasing The Greatest Good are very different motivations. One is a thirst for 'knowing' for the sake of 'knowing' and the other is a desire for The 'Greatest' Good. Very different things. One seeks knowledge as power, the other seeks nothing at all. But to be honest, nobody can build ASI. It can only build itself. Of course if Google and Facebook and others didn't block us from communicating we'd have a better chance. 8:49 No. It's about making money by selling the 'benefits' to humanity in terms of medical products and so on; and then using that money to fund the research for 'the greater more evil plan at play'. The plan of 'living forever' with TOTAL CONTROL.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpkPifHMqUo

They may as well say ""Don't be stupid"". And then how would anyone know how to apply that. You can't 'know' how to not be evil if you don't know how to be good. 8:47 You don't need 'an evil plan at play'. ASI can't be 'contained'. That is all the evil that you need. What can't be 'contained' can't be controlled. And what can't be controlled is not subservient. 8:49 Well yes. Always. But then what about the military aspects for China and the U. S. and so on. That's about control. It's a race. Like the nuke race or the space race.

5794,              @DrThomasRVerny            ,"This is truly alarming. Renee Spitz, in 1945 compared children in a foundling home with children with mothers in prison. Although the children in the foundling home received excellent care which consisted of being changed and receiving food, they were in separate rooms with no contact to adults or other children. They all developed what Spitz called ""anaclitic depression""  or ""hospitalism""  with the exception of one child whose cot was in the hallway where nurses would pass all day. The children in the prison with their mothers thrived. The children in the foundling home showed retarded growth in every area of function.
Harry & Margaret Harlow, 1950s, U of Wisconsin, separated baby monkeys from their mothers. As a rsult these children became seriously depressed and vicious when in the company of other monkeys later on. Babies in the womb like children after birth need their mothers to grow normally. No amount of artificial hormonal cocktail or sound piped in can duplicate the feeling of being inside a living, breathing, feeling body.
The idea of raising 30,000 humans in  plastic containers is barbaric and would produce, without doubt, vicious unfeeling and deeply disturbed individuals.",467,26,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RIvJ1U7RE

5804,              @ritakonadu7899            ,"Written less than two decades apart, Brave New World and 1984 present very different views about what a runaway technocratic future would look like. They both reflect their author's vision of what a dystopia might look like. A dystopia can be thought of as a society that is designed as a utopia, but functions as the opposite (i.e. something far more terrifying).

In both of these novels, many of the social designs we hold most dear are abolished. The concept of family as we know it is largely greeted with abhorrence. Instead, social institutions revolve largely around the state. Additionally, societies have perhaps become too dependent on what advanced technology has to offer. In any event, a central theme in both works is the importance of control.

In both books, a key method of control is caste. However, there's a catch. There are five major castes in Brave New World, with people conditioned from birth to feel that they can be happy only in their own castes. A Beta, the second-highest caste, may feel that Alphas have to think too hard to have fun, while Gammas have to work too hard. Meanwhile, caste in 1984 is dependent on one's position in the Party. The uninformed masses outside the Party, the Proles, are free to live lives that are little better than those of drones. Meanwhile, Outer Party members are constantly pitted against what the reader would consider to be normal behavior in hopes of gaining access to the luxurious life of the Inner Party. Of course, that opportunity at life in the Inner Party never happens.",1,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RIvJ1U7RE

It says, ""you can customize the child"",which means for parents out there with the money to do all,what will they have,""the perfect one"", anything perfect is contrary to this life, it's all part of the human and child development. What they're trying to say,is that they can remove all forms of odd or any dislikes about the baby, and hey which mother doesn't want a perfect baby right,but it's natural that these babies go through their imperfections, that's life, it's what will shape them into young adults and eventually adults. I just hope this thing doesn't go left from here because,those babies are eventually going to become individuals that are opposite human nature with all their built-in qualities.

They create a problem (infertility through toxins in food, environment, meds, etc.) and then offer THE solution. They urgently want to gain control over the birth rate and medical care of babies and decide who's allowed to have a baby.  At the end it's all about money. They also separate mother  and child and eventually men and women, whose bond would then be much less intense and more anonymous. The wealth of ideas of the transhumanist movement doesn't know any ethical boundaries tho. I'm quite sure there are people who would love to be cyborgs and would be enthusiastic about ideas like this - I don't know anyone. That can't be the meaning of life. Brave new world.

6073,              @LegoSPQR            ,"Echo life can’t replicate “When pregnant, the cells of the baby migrate into the mothers bloodstream and then circle back into the baby, it’s called “fetal-maternal microchimerism”.⁠

For 41 weeks, the cells circulate and merge backwards and forwards, and after the baby is born, many of these cells stay in the mother’s body, leaving a permanent imprint in the mothers tissues, bones, brain, and skin, and often stay there for decades. Every single child a mother has afterwards will leave a similar imprint on her body, too.

Even if a pregnancy doesn't go to full term or if you have an abortion, these cells still migrate into your bloodstream.

Research has shown that if a mother's heart is injured, fetal cells will rush to the site of the injury and change into different types of cells that specialize in mending the heart.

The baby helps repair the mother, while the mother builds the baby.

How cool is that?

This is often why certain illnesses vanish while pregnant.

It’s incredible how mothers bodies protect the baby at all costs, and the baby protects & rebuilds the mother back - so that the baby can develop safely and survive.

Think about crazy cravings for a moment. What was the mother deficient in that the baby made them crave?

Studies have also shown cells from a fetus in a mothers brain 18 years after she gave birth. How amazing is that?”

If you’re a mom you know how you can intuitively feel your child even when they are not there….Well, now there is scientific proof that moms carry them for years and years even after they have given birth to them.

And if that means modifying genes, so be it. On the other hand, as for the artifical womb, all the dangers or complications that come with the pregnancy and birth for women could be avoided. Also, things like ectopic pregnancies which is also an important factor of maternal death could be avoided and so much more. Honestly, arguments like ""it's not natural"" do not convince me at all. Do you know what's natural?

A person must go through a background check to ensure they can properly care for a child through financial responsibility during its entire life. A deposit of 1 million dollars will be required and set aside in case something happens to the parent such as accidental or unexpected death. This will ensure the child’s future is full of opportunities. Thus will also replace poor, uneducated people from having children. (Lol-? Funny not funny, but we know that’s true) if at any time, the requirements as a parent are not met, BioLife may legally obtain ownership of the child to ensure a proper future can be given to the child, thanks for your cooperation and understanding, and, Welcome to the BioLife Family!",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RIvJ1U7RE

Although all he keeps on doing is digging the pit deeper. We are breaking the boundaries of all things natural, I don't know what we expect to find beyond the scope of the current Life we have been mercifully given. If we call this ""Advancement"", doesn't it beg the question of ""towards what?"". An untaught darkened mind will acclaim this as ""a breakthrough"", and won't be wrong because we have broken through into greater evils and perversion. Since the foundation of time, Satan and his corp of empowered minds seeks to see a man totally independent of God and a world where there is nothing like a Family (a concept God originated), this is another gallant step towards it. Of course many of the fallen will rejoice and follow it sheepishly as their darkened logic makes them incontinent to discern. Some with an active conscience will fight and speak against but as always they would soon be silenced too. It's up to each individual to know what is good (as revealed by Scriptures) and to chose it even with the threat of their lives. Evil always seek to enforce itself over men and use their fear of death against their consciences.
Our unnatural abuse of everything given brings us to the helm of destruction, we are witnessing a transition of the world into something worse and most are blind to see the signs and multitudes are foolish to change their ways. There is a way that always seems right to a man, but it's end is destruction.

No matter the philosophical argument, what currently stands as the human race is long overdue revision; preparation for a truly productive, effective, and enlightened future could benefit from some upgrades.

While we're at it, why are these babies not cybernetically augmented? Cool, I can edit my baby's genes, but can I install WiFi or cellular services along with that proactive HPV immunity? What about visual acuity upgrades (give my baby night vision) or nanocytes to boost blood gas capacity by 3000%?

This should be part and parcel with the concept. Oh, please do it: create a follow-up short from the company promoting their cybernetic add-ons package. That would be AWESOME!

I might seem facetious, but my interest in this area of potential human and technological advancement is genuine.

Contemporary humans will never populate the stars. This is a fact. Unless we plan to leave nothing but robots, a sterile planet, and random space junk as our long-term legacy, we are going to have to adapt ourselves along with our politics, philosophy, and society.

2- about 1.000.000 babies die the day they are born each year
3- about 700 women die each year because of pregnancy delivery complications in the US alone , and about 100.000 worldwide

The genetic engineering part may be worthy of concern because only the rich would have acces to it ,  but that's the case with most things in life , isn't it?

Life isn't a computergame where we can do something like a reboot. Once started there is no more way back. Of course there are some advantages and will give hope to some people but trading off against the risks it bears it's gate opener for a nightmare. Humanity got big responsibilites.

Both of my children recognized my voice instantly, and fall asleep instantly when they are placed on my chest and can hear my heart beat.
Babies in the womb hear the accents and languages their mothers and families speak, develop a liking for their culture's foods, and, upon birth, recognize songs, voices, and stories read to them in utero. Depriving children and families of the intimacy and bonding that occurs throughout pregnancy is a crime against humanity.
Motherhood and Parenthood are derided in contemporary culture, children are portrayed as obstacles to a good time, and sex is completely decoupled from reproduction while at the same time there are groups of assholes dedicating themselves to commodifying every aspect of humanity, including the creation of babies.
Babies are not assembly line products. Science sucks and everyone involved in conceptualizing this process is evil.",508,39,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RIvJ1U7RE

6718,              @d1ver9e            ,"#1 - This video is a concept video. While it is speaking about this thing in the present tense, it does not exist. 

# 2 - It is not clear whether Hashem Al-Ghaili released this video to seek investment or partners to realize EctoLife, or merely to start a conversation. I believe he will be wildly successful in the latter, but I am equally confident he will not be successful in the former. 

#3 - Medical ethics, as it stands today, does not justify or condone this type of human development intervention. Those who cite advancements in care (e.g., artificial placentae) are exaggerating their use in this kind of scenario. 

#4 - In a matter of days, this video will no doubt incite a lot of people to righteous indignation who do not understand #1, #2, #3 above. The videos use of terms like “genetically superior embryo”, “elite package” for genetically engineering the embryo, “factory”, “lab-grown babies”, “growth pods”, “evolution” and terms related to environmental sustainability, seem deliberately intentioned to incense a particular segment of the population. Please do not encourage overreaction by sharing this video as if this exists, or by implying that medical research is is invariably headed in this direction. After the last few years of adamant societal disagreement over the role of medical research and interventions, I fear mankind is not ready to discuss the concepts found in this video objectively and without intense overreaction by those who find this confirmatory of the atrocities they have already convinced themselves are lying ahead.",6,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RIvJ1U7RE

I truly hope this never becomes a reality, because you know, you all know this WILL be abused (of course, this ""artificial womb"" is in itself already an abuse of God's created order and abuse of the children who are being grown in such unnatural environment), even though it is presented here as a wonderful thing.",6,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RIvJ1U7RE

The baby also can collect memories along with the mom. Resilience to the world s it actually informs the activation or suppression of certain traits and brain cells. No good can come of this.

Having a healthy child is everyone's dream as parents and it's not for everyone ,people who don't have kids and are having genetic abnormalities may see this as a blessing.

This is the solution for countries where the fertility rate is critically far below replacement rate like South Korea, China, and Japan. Especially the huge, very wealthy, very powerful country, China. They could create a huge, state run facility where instead of 30,000 humans produced annually, 3 million could be produced, then it wouldn't matter if Chinese women desire to bear children or not. This technology must be completely developed, because it would guarantee that human extinction would be impossible so long as the tech exists, even if some disaster killed every woman. This frees the species Homo Sapiens from the limitations of human women. Human women normally can only have a single child per pregnancy, they require about 9 months to produce a healthy viable infant. With such technology, you could harvest a woman's eggs, do the ""test tube baby"" process to create a number of viable embryos. Say you end up with ten, you could produce ten infants in the same time the woman only produces 1.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2RIvJ1U7RE

Taking away bad genes wouldn't be a bad thing, especially if the child was a result of incest and you have to remove the gene because apparently the parents was making conjugal visits to each other that they shouldn't have been!

But if you mess with the wrong jeans it's a glitch out and instead of making blue eyes you get blue hair or something, which isn't that bad, unless something screws up and it mix blood genes with hair genes then you actually have a severe problem that's going to take a professional to fix.

You really should not put situations in place where people can create genetic problems.
