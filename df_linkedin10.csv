Citymagine,5,3 comments,1 repost,"Imagine being transported in an autonomous vehicle!  🚘You're in Luck.At theAmerican Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA)conference in Phoenix, Arizona, we had a fascinating experience firsthand thanks toTed Bailey. TheWaymoautonomous car, a Jaguar E-PACE, took us through the bustling city streets without a driver! 🤯We were blown away by the advanced technology that allowed the WAYMO to navigate precisely and safely.The interior comfort was amazing, with ample space and a high-quality entertainment system. With a maximum speed of 95 km/h, rapid travel through the city is easy.If you're looking for a unique and revolutionary experience, we highly recommend a ride in a WAYMO autonomous vehicle on your next visit to Phoenix. You're sure to be impressed by what this technology can do.For only $16, you can enjoy 25 minutes of safe and secure transportation. If any concerns arise, there's an emergency button to connect you with a customer service representative ✅Additionally the WAYMO parks in the safest possible spot to ensure road user and passenger safety.What has your experience been with WAYMO?

Melissa Cefkin,146,9 comments,,"A new chance for a new chapter… I was affected in the most recent round of lay-offs at Waymo, making me ""ex-Waymo"".In my nearly 3 years at Waymo I worked with some amazing, amazing colleagues. I’ll remain forever grateful for the kindness and respect they’ve shown. I learned a great deal— about autonomous systems at scale, about people and their mobility practices, about developing a not-yet-prime-time product, about the variety of ways to explore and understand people in the lives they lead. So much learning, so much kindness, so much smarts and generosity!  Some of my best times were in the seat of a Waymo vehicle, with it driving autonomously. Truly a marvel, in the most mundane and everyday ways possible!Pausing for a breath while I consider next steps and future directions. Please DO hit me up if you’ve got any ideas you’d like to toss around, possible offers, or just to pass time#learning#people#respect#kindness#grateful#futurewith a fellow traveler for this time on earth.",10 hours ago

jamil siddiq,0,,,"Yes, it has been reported that General Motors (GM) is developing its own lidar (light detection and ranging) system. Lidar is a technology that uses lasers to create high-resolution 3D maps of the surrounding environment. It is a crucial component in many autonomous vehicle systems, as it allows the vehicle to ""see"" and navigate the world around it.According to reports, GM is developing a solid-state lidar system, which uses micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to create the laser beams. This approach is said to be cheaper and more scalable than traditional lidar systems, which use spinning mirrors to create the laser beams.GM's lidar system is being developed in-house by a team of engineers at the company's Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. The goal is to create a lidar system that is reliable, cost-effective, and scalable for use in future GM vehicles.It's worth noting that GM is not the only company developing lidar systems. Other companies, such as Waymo, Velodyne, and Luminar, are also working on lidar technology for autonomous vehicles.",1 day ago

Colin Barnden,14,,,"Incredibly timely post on the limits of#deeplearninginThe Ojo-Yoshida Report. A lot of folks are suddenly understanding what ""emergent properties leading to phase transitions in complex systems"" actually means, following the collapse ofSilicon Valley Bank.Financial markets, like public roads, are complex not complicated. Everything works fine, right up to the point at which it doesn't and then the system fails catastrophically. Financial markets are highly automated and sophisticated investors were early adopters of#AIand#DLto find a competitive trading edge. They forgot the lessons of#LTCMfrom 1998.We have just witnessed a phase transition in financial markets, as depositors panicked to remove their funds from#SVB, before the cash ran out. No AI/DL#algorithmcan help you when the bank has been shut down. It took humans (Central Bankers) to decide what to do next and move things forward, but we are at the beginning not the end of the next banking saga.#Autonomousdrivingoffers a similar illusion to financial markets. It looks really easy most of the time, until everything goes wrong at once, and then AI/DL can't help you. It needs human intervention and ingenuity to resolve a problem and get things moving again, until the next snarl up that is.  That is what we see in San Francisco with Cruise and Waymo#robotaxisnafus on an almost daily basis.Taking humans out of the driving loop altogether is like taking central bankers out of the financial system. It wasn't machines that could demonstrate judgment under uncertainty and create a way forward with SVB, it was people.Ironically the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank shines a spotlight onto the autonomous developers, and their messages of taking humans out of the driving loop. Some of those companies will remain in business this month simply because of the actions of humans, but longer term it raises the question of the wisdom of replacing humans as drivers.#ChatGPTis fun.

Thankfully no injuries indicated in any of these reports.Takeaways: These reports are a sign that these companies are honoring reporting requirements. They do not indicate these vehicles are more or less safe than human drivers because we lack the number of miles driven. And this might just have been a bad month. But this should make it clear that crashes are expected to happen during testing, and any state that does not require crash reporting is basically closing its eyes and ignoring the impact of such testing on other road users. (Blame is not the point here. A crash is a crash. If we did have crash rate data, an elevated crash rate data is a problem regardless of assigned blame. If crash rates were lower, that would be a win for automation. But the companies aren't providing data in a way we can assess that, so it would be ill-advised to assume they are at this point safer than human drivers.)Kudos to California for requiring collision reports, providing a level of transparency. Also, while one could always want more information, these reports were reasonably factual accounts without the blame/spin we've come to expect from other companies operating there.https://lnkd.in/eAWerMVQ",3 days ago

Het is niet dat ik niet van innovatie hou. De ondraaglijke saaiheid van het normale trok me nooit aan. Innovatie is bovendien de focus geweest van een groot deel van mijn academische carrière. Maar simpele journalisten, egotrippers die hun naam in neon letters op Mars willen hebben, managers met een overschot aan geld en een tekort aan technisch vernuft, en een goede hypemachine voor de nieuwe technologieën dragen ertoe bij dat de samenleving telkens opnieuw vergeet dat innovatie véél trager gaat dan gedacht. Iedere degelijk wetenschappelijk onderbouwde studie van innovatie en technologische vooruitgang zal tonen dat innovatie langer duurt dan gedacht, de ontgoochelingen veel groter zijn dan geanticipeerd, en de ontnuchterende zelfreflecties veel talrijker vooraf ingeschat.De redenen zijn eenvoudig - enerzijds is de vernieuwing technologische uitdagend en anderzijds verloopt de adoptie ervan vermoeiend traag. Innovatie vereist immers gedragsverandering, en dat is iets wat het merendeel van de mensen niet echt leuk vindt. In de woorden van Lester Thurow - ""Sociology always beats technology, but eventually sociology changes."" Dat het veranderen van die 'sociologie' zeer traag gebeurt, vergeet men al te vaak.  In de woorden van Paul Ormerod - ""Most experiments fail."" Bon, hoe waar dit ook is, met dergelijk fatalisme komen we ook niet bij een betere wereld, natuurlijk. It spoils the fun big time.Het is natuurlijk ambigu - het zijn de gekke projecten die de wereld vooruitbranden. En dus moeten we af en toe geloven dat die radicale innovatie zal lukken. Maar dat is precies de essentie van 'geloof' - meegaan in een gedachtegoed zonder dat er empirisch bewijs is dat het écht goed komt. De Ongelovige Thomas is een rolmodel dat iets meer mag worden gewaardeerd in de huidige techgekte. Eind januari tankte ik mijn Q5 (diesel) vol in Kitzbühel, en ik reed zonder bijtanken 1000 km huiswaarts. Zal mijn volgende wagen elektrisch zal zijn? Geloof ik dat er snel een elektrische wagen zal zijn van pakweg €45.000, die er niet belachelijk uitziet, en die écht een actieradius van >800km heeft?

Today, we are on the brink of a new era in transportation, where autonomous vehicles and flying cars are becoming a reality. In this post, we'll explore what the future of the automotive industry might look like and what it means for the way we move.> Self-Driving CarsSelf-driving cars have been a hot topic for years, with companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Uber racing to develop the technology that will make them a reality. While there are still some hurdles to overcome, such as regulatory challenges and public trust, experts predict that self-driving cars will be on the roads in the near future. Self-driving cars have the potential to reduce accidents caused by human error, improve traffic flow, and increase accessibility for people who are unable to drive themselves.> Electric VehiclesElectric vehicles (EVs) are already on the roads, but they still only make up a small fraction of the total number of cars on the road. However, with advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure, EVs are becoming more practical and affordable for everyday consumers. Governments around the world are also incentivizing the purchase of EVs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. It's likely that we'll see a significant increase in the number of EVs on the roads in the coming years.> Flying CarsWhile it may seem like something out of science fiction, the idea of flying cars has been around for decades. In recent years, advancements in technology have made the idea more feasible than ever before. Companies like Uber and Airbus are already testing prototypes of flying cars, and experts predict that they could be a reality within the next decade. Flying cars would provide a new mode of transportation that could bypass traffic on the ground, but they would also require new infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to be put in place.The future of the automotive industry is exciting and full of possibilities. From self-driving cars to flying vehicles, we are on the cusp of a transportation revolution. However, there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory hurdles and public perception. As technology continues to advance, it will be interesting to see how the industry evolves and what new innovations will be introduced.#future#technology#climatechange#infrastructure#transportation#cars#science",5 days ago

Mas o Jaguar I-Pace que servirá de táxi autônomo será testado apenas em Santa Monica e terá sua rota ampliada gradualmente.Hoje, a Waymo opera um serviço de táxi autônomo em São Francisco, também na Califórnia (onde outro robotáxi, da Amazon, já começou a rodar). Porém, só pode cobrar pela corrida dos passageiros quando um operador de segurança humana está no banco da frente.O site Tech Crunch informou que a empresa ainda precisa de outras licenças para iniciar um serviço de robotaxi comercial adequado em Los Angeles. O que pode levar a mais meses de testes.A Waymo diz que está otimista de que alcançará rapidamente a operação total em São Francisco e em LA devido à “qualidade das operações nas estradas” e dos recursos do seu driver de quinta geração.",5 days ago

Michael B.,3,,,"Autonomous trucking is a rapidly growing industry that aims to revolutionize the transportation sector by reducing costs, improving efficiency, and increasing safety. However, the industry has faced a number of setbacks in recent years, including accidents, regulatory hurdles,  public skepticism, and lack of funding.Despite these challenges, One Stop Systems (OSS) is well-positioned to help the autonomous trucking industry overcome its obstacles. OSS offers a range of high-performance rugged computing systems that can help companies develop and test autonomous driving algorithms more quickly and efficiently.For example, OSS's rugged GPU accelerators can speed up the training of machine learning models used in autonomous driving systems, while its rugged flash storage arrays can provide the fast data access needed to process large amounts of sensor data in real-time.By using OSS's products, companies working on autonomous trucking can accelerate their development timelines, reduce costs, and improve the safety and reliability of their systems.Overall, while the autonomous trucking industry may be facing some challenges, companies like OSS are well-positioned to help drive innovation and progress in this exciting field.#transportation#trucking#autonomousdriving#auroratech#waymo#torcrobotics#ruggedcomputers#nvidia#autonomoustrucks#truckingindustry#ai#artificialintelligence",6 days ago

Nitin Chopra,1,,,"""Connected, Autonomous, Shared, and Electric (CASE)"" refers to the four major technological trends shaping the future of the automotive industry.The increasing connectivity of cars allows them to communicate with other cars, infrastructure, and even the internet. This enables various features such as real-time traffic information, remote diagnostics, and over-the-air software updates.Autonomous driving technology allows vehicles to operate without human input, using sensors and advanced algorithms to navigate roads safely. This technology promises to improve safety, reduce congestion, and enhance mobility for people who cannot drive, such as the elderly and disabled.Shared mobility refers to the use of vehicles on a pay-per-use or subscription basis, rather than individual ownership. This includes ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, car-sharing services like Zipcar, and even public transportation systems.Electric vehicles (EVs) use batteries and electric motors to power the car, rather than gasoline engines. This technology promises to reduce emissions, lower operating costs, and enhance performance.Collectively, these four trends are driving major changes in the automotive industry and are expected to shape the future of transportation. The term ""CASE"" is often used to describe these trends because they are seen as interrelated and mutually reinforcing.Follow me for more interesting technology facts.

ichu peng,0,,,2023 年下半年（及以后）#我最想购买的股票2023 年 3 月 8 日上午 6:18Alphabet 遭到重创，股价比高点低 40%。这个占主导地位的行业领导者仍有很大的增长潜力。目前，大多数 FAANG 股票都有充分的理由。 仅举几个例子，亚马逊的交易价格不到其近期峰值的一半，而 Netflix 最近报告的订户数量大大好于分析师的预期。然而，随着我们进入春季，在利率和通胀仍然高企且经济不确定性持续存在的情况下，有一只 FAANG 股票看起来像是一个特别强大的长期机会：谷歌母公司 Alphabet (GOOGL 0.80%) (GOOG 0.71%)。 该公司提供了罕见的成熟度、盈利能力和增长潜力的组合，股价从高点下跌了约 40%，对于耐心的投资者来说，这似乎是一笔划算的交易。具有成熟和增长潜力的核心业务Alphabet 大约 90% 的收入来自谷歌服务，公平地说，这是一系列相对成熟的广告驱动型业务。 占主导地位的谷歌搜索平台是最大的组成部分，但这还包括 YouTube、Gmail、Android、Chrome、地图和其他流行的面向消费者的平台。纳斯达克：#GOOGL(0.80%) 0.75 美元时价 94.61 美元这方面的业务可能仍有巨大的增长潜力，但在未来几年不太可能发生。 然而，谷歌服务是一系列坚如磐石的主导业务，可产生可靠的高利润收入流。另一方面，目前约占公司收入 10% 的 Google Cloud 可能成为未来几年的主要增长动力。 它提供业务协作工具、云存储、数据库服务、内容分发网络 (CDN)、人工智能和机器学习工具、应用程序平台等等。 总之，Google Cloud 提供了 150 多种不同的产品。目前，谷歌云在该业务中所占比例相对较小，但未来几年可能会发生变化。 一方面，云计算是公司增长最快的部分，第四季度收入同比增长 32%。 它是最近几个季度在云基础设施市场中获得重要份额的三大云提供商中唯一的一家（亚马逊的 AWS 和微软的 Azure 是领导者）。不仅如此，云市场本身也在迅速扩张。 到 2022 年，云计算市场的规模估计为 4840 亿美元，但预计到 2030 年将增长两倍以上，达到 1.55 万亿美元的机会。 如果谷歌云能够增加其市场份额，这最终可能成为一个巨大的增长动力。Alphabet 目前是我最喜欢的 FAANG 股票还有其他一些原因。  “其他赌注”部分目前没有产生太多收入，但未来可能会发生变化。  Waymo 自动驾驶汽车初创公司尤其有前途，但在医疗保健和人工智能等行业也有一些初创公司。 需要明确的是，即使这些业务一无所获，我也会购买 Alphabet——但这是对这家科技巨头未来潜力的一个很好的补充。 而且它也不会将公司的收购潜力限制在适合谷歌服务和云领域的组织。最后，重要的是要考虑 Alphabet 出色的财务状况。 该公司的资产负债表上有大约 1400 亿美元的现金和证券，这赋予了它巨大的财务灵活性，尤其是考虑到它仅在过去四个季度就产生了近 600 亿美元的净收入。  Alphabet 可以为收购机会提供资金，对创新进行再投资，或者在它认为合适的时候机会主义地回购股票,6 days ago

Jason McNabb,0,6 comments,,"I have been remarkably blessed over the last 10+ years to be at the very forefront of technology as it has grown to be SO impactful in both our personal and professional lives. I was on the launch pad with Uber Technologies when Uber was still determining what it wanted to be as a company. When industry terms such as SaaS and TaaS had yet to be made popular. In fact, I remember not being allowed to use SaaS as a term at all when communicating with customers or partners because it was considered ""lingo"". Now, it's an every day term. I was with Waymo/Google (contracted, of course) as an operations specialist assisting in teaching autonomous vehicles how to drive completely on their own. In those years it was outstanding to see these vehicles go from stopping and asking more questions than a two year old while attempting to navigate its way through dynamic/real life scenarios (referred to as an alert) - to being able to make extremely impressive judgement calls - on its own and in mere seconds, or less, of that event occurring. I look forward to being able to point to one of those vehicles one day with my son and sharing with him that his old man was a part of that journey.Now, AI has stepped into the forefront of everyone's mind and is moving from sci-fi to sci-real. A thought that is both fascinating AND a little nerve-racking. On one side when you hear the term AI you may think SkyNet, Hal, and Project Eagle Eye. On the other, more pragmatic side, you may think JARVIS or Bladerunner. My career has been on the forefront of technology, but my education - my foundation - was and continues to be centered on the Human Element. Psychology. So I am constantly considering how these two worlds collide and the impact they have when they do. It can be absolutely empowering when these two worlds collaborate and work with each other in ways that launch us forward. BUT, it can also be soul-crushing to hear that AI has been implemented in some cases as a total replacement for the Human Element. To that effect the question becomes rather simple - When does AI become less of a TOOL, and more like a CRUTCH?LinkedIn is venturing into this field in a way that I find to be an interesting manner worthy of exploring. AI and industry professionals collaborating to share knowledge, experience, and time-tested/real life industry wisdom in an engaging way. Personally, I believe this to be a great example of how AI can be utilized as a TOOL for both professional and personal growth.#ai#career#technology#linkedin#TheHumanElement#leadership#management#professionalgrowth#woosender",1 week ago

Doris Holler-Bruckner,21,1 comment,3 reposts,"𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐬 𝐤𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧Nein.. eigentlich sind sie schon da, wenn auch noch nicht in Europa. Erst vor ein paar Tagen hat mir ein Freund erzählt, der beruflich in Phoenix/Arizona war, dass sein Kollege ihm ein WAYMO bestellt hat, ein Robotertaxi, das#autonommit  Level-4-Technologie fährt, vollends fahrerlos. Das#robotaxisieht ziemlich normal aus, eingebaut ist die Technik in Chrysler Minivans und in den Jaguar I-PACE electric. Mission von Waymo ist, Verkehrsunfälle zu verhindern, denn 94% dieser Unfälle passieren durch menschliche Fehler. Mittlerweile sind die Robotaxis in einigen US-Städten erlaubt, Start und Ziel müssen innerhalb fixierter Gebiete erfolgen. Also rollen diese fahrenden Computer schon auf den Straßen. Aber das ist nicht alles: Im nächsten Schritt soll, mit WAYMO Via, der Gütertransport autonom erfolgen.Klar gibt es noch manchmal Probleme, so hat ein#robotaxivon Cruise, einem weiteren Anbieter in den USA, im Herbst einen Unfall ausgelöst, weil das Fahrzeug bremste und nicht abbog, als ein entgegenkommendes Auto zu weit rechts fuhr. Außerdem kam es einmal zu einem Stau, weil mehrere Fahrzeuge aufgrund eines Softwareproblems mitten auf einer Hauptstraße stehen blieben.Was heißt das nun konkret? Autos mit leistungsfähigeren Sensoren, gleichzeitig ein mehr an Hochleistungscomputern in den Fahrzeugen und mehr Nachfrage nach Halbleitern. Noch macht Cruise hohe Verluste, aber die eingesetzten Komponenten werden immer günstiger. LiDAR, eine Technik zu Abstands-, Geschwindigkeits- und Fernmessung, ist in letzter Zeit stark im Preis gesunken, und seine Akzeptanz nimmt zu. Das ist, wie Insider wissen, ein Schlüsselfaktor, denn LiDAR wird auch für Fahrzeuge von auf Level-3 fahrende autonome Fahrzeuge eingesetzt und bringt weitere Sicherheitsvorteile. In China will Jidu, eine Geely-Tochter bereits heuer  damit starten, das autonome#elektroautoRobo-01 für den Massenmarkt zu produzieren.  In Europa stehen mehrere Modellprojekte in den Startlöchern. All das zeigt auf: Autonomes Fahren ist nicht mehr aufzuhalten, auch wenn es noch etliche gesetzliche Änderungen geben muss, die sicherlich gerade in Europa noch genug Zeit in Anspruch nehmen.#technologie#autonomesfahren#robotaxi#mobility",1 week ago

I did not survive the second wave of layoffs.I joined in 2015, when it was still named the ""Google self-driving project"" and focused on these cute but uncomfortable little cars. Today, the company is on the cusp of realizing its vision, and though much work remains it is a little less in need of engineers. It was a really fun job and I'm grateful for the chance to meet these amazing colleagues and to work on such an impactful endeavor.In the past few years, I also put a lot of effort into sustainability, working on Waymo's carbon accounting, pushing for various initiatives, and organizing climate workshops. I hope and I think that autonomous cars will be great for the climate, but it's no longer in my hands. So for my next move I am looking for a company that makes a difference for the planet, with some aspect of robotics, machine learning / AI, computer vision, where I can use my skills for good.

Does this mean that no new self-driving car company will exist?Let me share a story of how my company did back in the day...The year is 2018, and I'm a newly self-driving car engineer.Life is fantastic.I can finally work out of pure passion.Building autonomous shuttles in France!But something bothers me with the company I joined... It didn't raise funds!That's right. Not a single peso.And of course, it bothered me.I was looking at companies around me, and everybody was raising millions.But we weren't.We were staying a small team of 8-10 people.We were paid based on the company's income.And while the Argo, Uber, Waymo, etc... were purchasing 50k+ Velodyne LiDARs by dozens, we had to do with 2D LiDARs, costing only 4,000$ per unit.""Why playing the game in hard mode?"" I askedThe answer was, of course, profitability.""If we don't know how to be profitable now, we'll die in 5 years, just like everybody else."" told me my CEO.Of course, I didn't believe a single word. To me, we had better chances of sinking than the others.But 5 years later, self-driving car companies are closing one after the others.Argo AI shut down in 2022 after 3.6B$ raised.Waymo just fired 100+ engineers.Embark just announced a layoff too.They're all running out of funds.And these days, no investor is funding sinking boats.But those who learned to be profitable are still surviving, and they're the ones who will be able to not only lead the self-driving car revolution, but later raise funds, and define the game as they want to.It's crazy, but those who raised and spent billions are the ones dying today, and those who took their time to focus on ""making money"" and build a viable economical system are well established, and for some, thriving.So how do you make a profitable self-driving car company?I don't claim to have all the answers, I was merely a pawn on a chessboard.But I was a pawn with pretty wide-open eyes.When I started this newsletter in late 2019, I introduced this system as ""Lean Self-Driving Cars"", and everybody was telling me",1 week ago

Max Del Rosso,13,2 comments,1 repost,"🔥 [TEST] IL RIVALE DI CHATGPTHo testato Claude, l’AI di Anthropic, la società in cui Google ha recentemente investito 300 mln di dollari.A mio parere, qualità ottima. Ecco l’articolo:Il futuro è elettrico: come le auto elettriche stanno ridisegnando il domaniAuto a guida autonoma, condivise e sostenibili, le auto elettriche stanno accelerando verso il domani. Secondo gli esperti del settore, progressi nella tecnologia dei veicoli elettrici (VE), insieme a tendenze nella proprietà delle automobili, mostrano che i VE potrebbero presto dominare le strade.""Stanno avvenendo enormi progressi, da nuove tecniche di produzione a maggiore autonomia e più stazioni di ricarica"", afferma l'esperta dell'associazione CALSTART Susan Harris. Harris vede una convergenza tra VE e tecnologia di guida autonoma, specialmente nelle applicazioni di flotte e ride-sharing. ""La crescita di veicoli elettrici autonomi in flotte permetterà di ottimizzare le rotte e aumentare efficienza e convenienza"", dice.La società di previsioni IHS Markit prevede oltre 300 milioni di veicoli elettrici sulle strade globali entro il 2040. Un'infrastruttura elettrica in crescita, veicoli via via più accessibili e incentivi governativi potrebbero accelerare questa rivoluzione. Sarà possibile scegliere tra un'ampia gamma di VE per tipologia ed esigenza, dalle utilitarie alle auto di lusso.Nel presente, la Cina ospita quasi la metà di tutti i VE attualmente circolanti, sostenuta da ingenti investimenti governativi per combattere l'inquinamento. Anche in Europa la diffusione di VE è in rapida crescita, con alcuni Paesi - come Norvegia e Olanda - che mirano ad abolire auto a benzina e diesel entro il 2025. Rispetto a modelli pre-pandemici, la crisi COVID-19 potrebbe accelerare la transizione verso l'adozione di VE, con più persone che preferiscono evitare mezzi pubblici in favore di soluzioni di micromobilità individuale.Protagonisti di questa rivoluzione sono nuove aziende come Tesla e NIO, oltre a big player tradizionali come Volkswagen e Volvo. Crescono anche realtà focalizzate su tecnologie di guida autonoma, come Waymo, che si fondono con l'avanzamento dei VE: si prevede che entro 10-15 anni flotte hi-tech di VE senza conducente debutteranno in servizi di ride-sharing su strade selezionate.Un futuro ""full electric"" promette benefici ambientali, economici e di mobilità. I VE non emettono gas di scarico, riducendo inquinamento e dipendenza da petrolio. Costi di gestione inferiori e prezzi in picchiata ne abbasseranno accessibilità, destinati a diventare più convenienti di auto tradizionali. Nuove forme di sharing mobility potrebbero democratizzare la mobilità, con tutti che potranno permettersi di spostarsi in modo sostenibile. Restano sfide nell'aumentare infrastrutture e nell'incentivare l'adozione tra consumatori, ma con tecnologia e supporto che crescono a ritmo accelerato, auto elettriche ad alta tecnologia ci si profilano come il futuro che già bussa alle nostre porte.",1 week ago

Jacob Simon,48,5 comments,,"It’s 2023 and the future has finally arrived! Last night, I had my first self-driving taxi ride withCruisein San Francisco. Here’s my honest take on the experience:It feels like fully autonomous (Level 4) cars have been “almost here” for as long as I can remember. If you live in SF, you’ve seen self-driving cars from Cruise, Waymo, and Zoox being tested on the roads for the last decade but, until now, they haven’t been publicly available in any real capacity. Finally, last week, I received the notification that I’d made it off Cruise’s waitlist.As the saying goes, the “future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed.”Cruise’s app is a spitting image of Uber or Lyft, with an uncannily similar UX where you can select your pickup point and destination. You can preview the route your car will take and estimated time of arrival. Right now, however, there’s a few important limitations with Cruise:🕘 Hours of operation: These cars are only available from 10PM - 5AM. Presumably that’s to avoid traffic and minimize risk to other drivers.🗺️ Service area: Cruise is only operating in a limited portion of the city right now. I don’t know if that’s because some neighborhoods are harder to navigate or if it’s to minimize the distance they can travel.Our home is located in a confusing cul-de-sac on Telegraph Hill just outside the service area, soSonia Xuand I walked a few minutes into Chinatown and set our pickup location around there.Shortly after, we were assigned our driver, Eggs Benedict. We watched the app as our autonomous driver homed in on our location and then appeared around the corner.But then something a little weird happened. The car kept driving and didn’t stop! The app told us we only had 4 minutes to claim our ride, so in an unexpected turn of events, we started chasing Eggs Benedict down the street. Luckily it stopped just a couple blocks away.Aside from that rough start, the rest of the experience was smooth sailing. We got in the car, buckled up, and then were off. The experience of being driven through San Francisco without a driver was magical and trippy to say the least.That’s not to say our twenty minute ride was without obstacles and challenges. To start with, it was raining lightly during most of our trip, which is known to interfere with LiDAR sensors. We also encountered cars blocking the road, jaywalking pedestrians, and more. Benny navigated them without breaking a sweat.That said, there have been numerous reports of driverless cars blocking intersections and causing traffic jams the last few months. In terms of safety, I personally never felt at risk. On the contrary, our car was definitely taking its time and seemed to be avoiding the main streets in favor of quieter routes, so don’t use this if time is of the essence.In the end, it didn’t feel much different from any other ride—in a good way.What do you think? Are self-driving cars here to stay?#tech#artificialintelligence",1 week ago

Os projetos paralelos de grandes ideias que deveriam se tornar os geradores de receita do futuro foram particularmente atingidos, com alguns deles sendo completamente desmantelados e outros enfrentando profundos cortes nos investimentos.Oito anos atrás, o Google dividiu a empresa em entidades separadas e batizaram a coleção de Alphabet. A ideia era separar o negócio principal, sua gigantesca máquina de publicidade que a tornou uma das corporações mais poderosas do mundo, dos projetos paralelos que precisavam de tempo para se desenvolver, mas que um dia poderiam se tornar o próximo grande gerador de dinheiro do Google. Mas isso não se materializou. A receita ainda vem predominantemente da publicidade. O Google desativou a maioria de seus chamados “moon shots”, de balões de conexão de internet a lentes de contato de medição de glicose. E até mesmo os mais avançados de seus projetos paralelos, os carros autônomos Waymo e a start-up de tecnologia de saúde Verily, perderam tração. A Área 120, uma parte do Google que servia como uma “incubadora” interna de startups, perdeu a maior parte de seus funcionários e em breve será totalmente fechada. O departamento representava uma das peculiaridades do Google, permitir que alguns funcionários dedicassem tempo a projetos fora de suas tarefas regulares e até mesmo permanecessem na empresa às vezes para lançar startups, em vez de sair e fazer isso por conta própria.Em outubro, um mês antes de anunciar demissões generalizadas, a Amazon começou a desmantelar sua incubadora interna, a Grand Challenge. A equipe trabalhou em projetos como Echo Frames, tentativa da Amazon em óculos inteligentes e até pesquisas sobre o câncer.

A equipe trabalhou em projetos como Echo Frames, facada da Amazon em óculos inteligentes e até pesquisas sobre o câncer, informou a CNBC pela primeira vez em 2018. O líder da equipe Babak Parviz, que veio do Google X em 2014, deixou a Amazon em outubro. Sua saída foi seguida por notícias de que a maioria dos projetos do grupo seria encerrada, incluindo o Amazon Glow e o Amazon Explore, um produto de turismo virtual. O Amazon Care, que a empresa fechou em agosto, também foi um produto do Grand Challenge. Em vez de continuar a apoiar esse projeto, a Amazon adquiriu a start-up One Medical.

Nilesh Sharma,9,,,"Did you know that Google's self-driving car program,#waymo, started as a side project by two Google employees during their 20% time?In the early days of#google, the company had a policy that allowed employees to spend 20% of their time working on projects outside of their official job duties. This led to the creation of several iconic Google products, such as Gmail and Google News, but it also led to some more unusual projects.One such project was a self-driving car, which initially faced skepticism from many within the company. However, the two employees continued to work on their project during their 20% time and eventually built a small fleet of self-driving cars that could navigate city streets.Their work caught the attention of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who saw potential in the technology for Google's mapping and navigation products. In 2009, Google began testing their self-driving cars on public roads, and in 2012, they launched a fully self-driving car program that eventually became Waymo.The lesson? Encouraging employees to pursue#sideprojectsand experiment with new ideas can lead to innovative breakthroughs that can change entire industries. So if you're a manager or leader, consider adopting a similar policy of allowing employees to spend a portion of their time pursuing passion projects. You never know what kind of groundbreaking ideas might emerge!",1 week ago

Dr. Jeffrey Funk,435,60 comments,42 reposts,"Google, Amazon, and Meta have shuttered most of their moonshots and revenue still mostly comes from their core businesses: advertising for Google and Meta, and e-commerce and cloud services for Amazon.When Google went public in 2004, its founders warned investors not to expect the quarterly focus that most public companies are forced to heed. They set up Google X, to develop the weirdest and riskiest ideas, and told their employees they should spend part of their time on projects completely unrelated to their day jobs. “Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one,” they said.Eight years ago, Google’s founders changed its name to Alphabet to separate the core advertising business from the side projects that it began with Google X, more than 200 by one count including: Google Glass, Project Loon, Sidewalk Labs, Hangouts, and Picasa.The next big moneymaker hasn’t yet materialized and even the most advanced of its side projects –self-driving car lab Waymo, health-care Verily, -- are now doing little. Waymo laid off 8% of its workforce in February, adding to a previous round of cuts in January. Verily laid off 15% of its staff. Area 120, a part of Google that served as an internal start-up “incubator,” lost most of its employees and will soon be completely shut down.Amazon is doing the same. It began winding down its exploratory internal incubator, Grand Challenge, which worked on projects like Echo Frames, Amazon’s stab at smart glasses and phones (Fire), and even cancer research,In 2013, Bezos said that#Amazonwas testing delivery by drone. But 10 years later, Amazon’s drone operation has made few real-world deliveries.Facebook parent Meta is also still focused on its core business of social media and advertising. Despite investing billions into its long-term gamble to build out immersive digital realms known as the#metaverse, the uptake by users has been slow including the use of#VRand#ARpowered services. Zuckerberg has been forced to refocus his existing employees on the company’s top business objectives in the face of falling revenue and an uncertain economic future.Giving up the moonshot dream marks another stage in the companies’ march into middle age.#Google,#Facebookand Amazon all grew rapidly through the first two decades of the millennium through their focus on new business that they still dominate.The biggest#techcompanies have indeed managed to avoid disruption. But it wasn’t through reinventing themselves with internally created big ideas and the small expansions they did achieve came through acquisitions: Google’s Android operating system, Facebook’s mobile advertising business and Amazon’s audiobooks. Together with Google Apple, they have made hundreds of acquisitions over the past two decades.#technology#innovation#hype#ethics#startups#research",1 week ago

Cruise, GM's self-driving subsidiary, faced a probe from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Despite these challenges, there have been promising developments:Plans from companies Motional, Zoox, and Mobileye to launch driverless operations this year.

Timothy Papandreou,23,,3 reposts,"Hello Los Angeles- Lights 🚦 Cameras 📸 Lidar 🚨 Action! 🤖Waymois set to begin testing fully driverlessJaguar Land RoverI-Paces inCity of Los Angeleswithin the next couple of weeks.The self-driving technology company will start by allowing only employees to hail rides in the autonomous vehicles.Waymo has been mapping various neighborhoods in LA since 2019, including Downtown, Miracle Mile, Koreatown, and Westwood, and will begin testing inCity of Santa Monicabefore gradually expanding its rider-only services.The goal is to launch a 24/7#robotaxiservice in LA, but it still needs to secure several permits, including the driverless pilot permit from theCalifornia Public Utilities Commission(In CA you need a permit from the DMV to test AVs & from the CPUC to charge for rides).Waymo has been running a paid robotaxi service inCity of Chandler, Arizona, just outside ofCity of Phoenix, since 2020 and recently opened fully autonomous rides to members of the public in downtown Phoenix and toPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.In January, Waymo reached 1 million miles of public autonomous driving with no human monitor in the vehicle, and released it's safety report which reported a few fender benders ( all were reportedly by people driving erratically) and no collisions with pedestrians or bicyclists.With the announcement of its driverless testing in LA, Waymo is one step closer to commercializing its robotaxi services and offering a fully autonomous taxi service in California. LA is one of the largest ridehail markets in the US, and it's also one of the most traffic and travel complex markets- it'll be interesting to see how this works out.#robotaxi#automatedvehicles#robotics#ridehailing#transportation#innovation#technologyhttps://blog.waymo.com/",
