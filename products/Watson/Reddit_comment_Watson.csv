I believe they were also accepted into Y Combinator.

Llamalawyer,17-03-2015,"I actually don't think the ability to reason will save lawyers, but the power that lawyers wield will . I mean I think it's entirely possible for robots/computers/technology to get to a point that their algorithms will outperform many of the tasks we give lawyers, or any other skilled profession for that matter. Much like Watson, the jeopardy winning computer, is diagnosing patients at a higher degree of accuracy than real doctors. However, I can't imagine that our society will delegate to robots the responsibility of arguing to end the life of a person. I mean what are the moral implications of a totally autonomous criminal justice system? One where, you are caught, charged, defended, and sentenced by robots. It's seems very dystopian to me, and seems to grind on a few different intuitions. One, I like to think it would be morally offensive for most people, and would raise some skynet alarms. Two, I don't think we want to delegate away power. We love technology for mundane tasks, but rarely do we seek to delegate away our positions of power. To some degree I think power gives us purpose. Thus, I totally think we may heavily incorporate technology into the currently antiquated legal process, I don't think we will ever delegate our core responsibilities away.",0.443,0.4756410256410256,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/2r2yg7/legal_consulting_firm_believes_artificial/

Kind of like how we have our own discussions with our selves in our heads before we come to conclusions, it would be like having watson privately speaking to watson in order to figure out what watson thinks. Maybe by bouncing information back and forth internally between AI systems one can create a sort of artificial mind capable of thought, and maybe the more systems (or voices) its being internally bounced around can effect the level/predictability of the AI?
