Early on in their journey, an aspect they felt was important was measuring how colleagues feel about the changes being implemented as a result of the transformation. They use the Kubler-Ross change curve as a guide.Using the Change Journey Navigator insights tool, they are able to establish the impact of the changes by monitoring how the communication is landing with colleagues and thereby understand where to focus attention to improve clarity and increase engagement.An important end result is to have everyone across the company feeling they are part of the change, empowered to re-imagine their roles to better serve their customers, their suppliers and each other.Click for more info on the event:https://lnkd.in/eG8mNgr7For more information on Change Journey Navigator go to:https://lnkd.in/e8muSMGT",0.9643,0.565625,0,0,0

Victor Castro,15-03-2023,"Buy with prime fromAmazon...After a snarky comment in my friendRick Watsonpost this morning, I figured i should at least provide constructive feedback.I'm my opinion, BWP has a viable path to growth and scale. Their problem is that it only takes value from brands while providing no incrementally to a merchant. It says a lot about Amazon's lack of understanding of the D2C space - I think most folks don't realize how little Amazon knows in the space. Building a large successful marketplace is not the same skill setThere are 2 things Amazon can do and adoption would scale very quickly:1. Drive traffic: The fees paid for BWP should give you some credit/access to buy advertising on Amazon that pushes traffic to their owned ecom property2. Be a true commercial partner: share customer data from buyers of the brands products on Amazon. The customer data sharing can't be one way.BWP has the potential to be an interesting play for Amazon. You could squint and see a network of high quality merchants, that solve the merchandising quality problem Amazon currently has. BWP could be a subset marketplace of curated brands, that could then also drive an ad premium.I'm leaving aside the customer experience for now because honestly it's irrelevant until they can reach scale. I can't imagine any brand customer will use this more than once in it's current iteration.if you think this is a bad/negative take, wait until you hear what I think aboutShopifyShop... initiative.",0.9592,0.5407983193277311,1 ,4,0

With paradigm shifting international programmes such as the AUKUS submarine deal and the Global Combat Air Programme, ambitious and rigorous investments in future capabilities are a necessity.¬†The war in Ukraine has changed the world, and the UK must be pro-active in facing threats.And yet, whilst this is a good step forward, there is yet more to do.¬†Our army‚Äôs equipment lags behind many of our NATO allies.¬†The threats since the original iteration of the Integrated Review have dramatically increased.¬†Greater, bolder commitments are needed to deliver the support our armed forces need.‚Äùhttps://lnkd.in/ePWYnVYE#ukmanufacturing#ukmfg#springbudgetJames WatsonKelly MaddisonSamantha HillEstelle ExelbyMaria WinsperCharline DiomandeJames V.",0.9578,0.4661764705882353,0,11,1

Let√≠cia Tainara Souza,15-03-2023,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, hist√≥rico de tend√™ncias e evolu√ß√µes, aqui v√£o algumas das tend√™ncias de marketing para 2023:ü§≥üèª Marketing de influ√™ncia: o marketing de influ√™ncia chegou pra ficar e continuar√° a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conte√∫do para alcan√ßar p√∫blicos espec√≠ficos (√ì a base da Virginia a√≠, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).üéÅ Personaliza√ß√£o: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experi√™ncia personalizada e relevante, e as empresas est√£o investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estrat√©gias para atender a essa demanda.üìº V√≠deo marketing: o v√≠deo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produ√ß√£o de v√≠deo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Ent√£o investe nisso. A era dos est√°ticos morreu).üîä Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas est√£o come√ßando a adotar estrat√©gias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personaliza√ß√£o tamb√©m).üì© Marketing de conte√∫do: este continuar√° a desempenhando um papel importante na constru√ß√£o de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisar√£o investir em conte√∫do de alta qualidade e em estrat√©gias de distribui√ß√£o para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.üéØ Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experi√™ncia perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estrat√©gias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor est√° em todos os canais e √© inteligente pensar em estrat√©gias adaptadas em cada um deles.üé≤ Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas est√£o cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estrat√©gias de an√°lise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).ü§ñB√îNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estrat√©gias e materiais publicit√°rios tamb√©m √© algo que n√£o tem volta - e que bom! Se voc√™ √© um profissional da √°rea, sugiro come√ßar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estrat√©gias e tomadas de decis√£o. Pois como diz a famosa m√∫sica de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por a√≠, ""hoje √© um novo dia, de um novo tempo que come√ßou. Todos os nossos sonhos, ser√£o verdade e o futuro j√° come√ßou"".#marketing#tecnologia#amazon#empresas#salesforce#marketingsensorial#marketing2023#marketingderelacionamento",-0.3956,1.0,3 ,6,0
