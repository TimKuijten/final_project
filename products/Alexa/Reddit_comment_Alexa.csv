jawshoeaw,17-02-2023,Yeah I think many people are missing what’s truly revolutionary: a successful interactive natural language interface. I can’t get my phone or Alexa to do the simplest things because their interface is dumb. As in not very smart . It’s so starkly different talking to chatGPT it’s almost like stress relieving. I enjoy having a conversation with a computer that “understands “ me.
