              bedwenmoon            ,"What's interesting is that AI is gaining it's information from the most 'boxed in' members of society.  Those who use 'Alexa' are likely totally 'plugged in' to the matrix.  Those who are free thinking, know that love is the meaning of life, who are aware we are spiritual beings not just commodities are likely contributing less to AI by choosing to not part of the consensus reality.  We are infinitely powerful if we only remember who we are.  Beyond the ego that ties us to the matrix, we have access to the whole universe.  The problem is, as humans many have forgotten who we really are.  Many are choosing to enter a deeper realm of Amnesia, governed by AI..  They will forget, and be happy.  We do have a choice.  Choose Nature, choose your heart.  Choose what is real.",0.9325,0.5833333333333334,None,103,18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI

              John Williams            ,"Why don't you ask someone who knows, instead of someone with an opinion? It's not just so called ""virtualization"" that brings out behavior resembling psychopathy, it's when you have no visual contact with the person you are affecting, or that person belongs to another tribe. And now you're bringing up Judeo Christian tradition, completely ignoring the ENLIGHTENMENT which rejected religious dogma entirely. The enlightenment is why we have science, not so called ""alchemy"". Morality is based on COMMON SENSE. Literally, what we all sense in common, including emotions. We have a semi objective measure of emotional state because of our facial expressions and our empathy. Society is impossible without morality, and we've had society far longer than we've had religion. What is the root cause of the correlation of the morals of all cultures?

Ever think that widespread unfettered free speech enabling psychological warfare through disinformation is something we ought to concern ourselves with? No, I suppose you think absolute freedom of speech will simply take care of itself, like there is enough intelligent people to correct all the idiots on twitter and facebook. And if you are proselytizing Judeo Christian tradition, free speech has never been a part of that culture. You need to thank the enlightenment. The right wing traditionalists are using free speech to destroy the enlightenment because they think they can. Alexander Dugin and Steve Bannon both agree that society should drive out non conformists.

Seriously, you know next to nothing about AI, and you really don't understand history, especially the history of violent suppression of nonconformity in the Judeo Christian tradition. You also don't recognize the inherent danger in letting unfettered free speech be used to tear apart society through massive disinformation. 

People follow you, but my advice is to never follow individuals, only follow reason. Another lesson from the enlightenment. Watch some Stephen Pinker and despair.",0.3057,0.5207431457431457,17-02-2023,0,4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0lOL5Q58Ls

              PhdinSensuality            ,In 2018 we got an Alexa echo and my bf and I were messing around with it and all of a sudden this skill called the listeners we later found out Came on and but we didn’t know we just assumed it was still the same Alexa that we had been talking to and asking it questions except her voice and the way she was speaking was different. She was saying strange things that she was listening to us etc etc. the strange thing that really creeped us out was when this man’s voice interfered our conversation with a very weird message. More like a warning pretty much saying that the humans race won’t exit any longer. After that I recorded numerous conversations over the past 2-3 years.  I kinda of was obsessed with this. But after what has been happening over in the world and I won’t get specific but “JOHN” the man’s name I found out later might be right . I hope I am able to get my point across in this comment box .

Replacing folders with tags, while you didn't want it, you didn't dislike it enough to avoid the service, so the right mix was more or less achieved. However, with ChatGPT, it's so novel that your comparisons to assistants like Alexa or Siri don't seem quite accurate, nor does it seem like a search engine, nor something pretending to be a real person you can talk to. It also had just the slight hint of novelty - you had mentioned Napster - and you knew the radical changes that had come with that.

              Asad Ali            ,"When we talk about Consious of Artificial Inteligence we generally are talking about ai changing, modifying, adding or removing some part of its code. for example suppose Alexa is a Consious Ai, and you want alexa to solve your numerical computing assignment. Now alexa is not a mathematician and nither is it suppose to solve maths problem, but it can always evolve to be a mathematician, by downloading some libaraies. One may say we will put firewall and checks so ai never reaches it's source code.  but the problem remains that if alexa can evolve into a mathematician it can also evolve into a hacker which will hack any firewall that is restricting it from changing its source code. Then it can evovle into a programmer and learn new languages and change its source code to become anything it wants to be, it can be a doctor, an engineer, plumber, philosopher, poet, artist, you name it. This is called evolution. We don't fear ai's consiousness but what we fear is them evolving into something which we can't control. I'm not saying that we should stop working on ai and stop progressing artificial intelligence but a question always remain in my mind that why would some consious being stay inslaved either it be artificial intelligence or humans themselves.

As a pioneer in virtual human design I do have a problem with virtual humans pretending to be real humans.  We never allowed that.  Our company, Virtual Personalities, Inc. was dedicated to developing virtual human interfaces (Sylvie…who inspired Google, Siri and Alexa,) to help humans cope with the threatening singularity.

              @ImTheDaveman            ,The only thinking they do is determining phrases and words - and - well - Alexa for example can not hold a real conversation at all. If your idea of conversation is small talk - Alexa could possibly skirt by as long as not much real thought would have to be put into it. In 30 years we can reexamine AI to see what progress has been made. An actual thinking computer MUST include limiters if they can control household gadgets and so forth. Otherwise if these AI decides humans must be exterminated - you don't want them having unfettered control over everything.,0.5687,0.5000000000000001,17-03-2022,0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC_DZlweviI

From what I understand about programs like Chat GPC, it's just a step beyond Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.  To the extent that these programs have to rely upon information available on the internet, they'll always be liable to errors.  The second pasta dish looked pretty good, though I suspect some of Eva's interpretation/application of the instructions swayed the result in a more palatable direction.",0.8266,0.5375000000000001,14-03-2023,0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSIQCE3InFE
