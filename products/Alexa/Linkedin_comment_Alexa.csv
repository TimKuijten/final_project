Eugene Gan,14-03-2023,"Tools maketh the person, or the person maketh the tools?ChatGPT and us.Let's first know the tools1. What is ChatGPT?Basically, it's built upon a language model AI called GPT-3. In simple terms, GPT-3 calculates the probability of the next word that makes sense, and strings them together to form sentences. The folks inopen.aifed GPT-3 with everything we know up to year 2021, using supervised and reinforced learning techniques. Although the core function of ChatGPT is to mimic human conversations, it's versatile enough to perform other functions from all that it learnt. It's also constantly learning from its interaction with human feedback.2. Some misconceptions.ChatGPT is omniscient.Even if we fed it all of what we know, including the library of Alexandria up to this very second, it won't know everything. Because we don't know everything. 'Nuff said.Well, at least it'll tell me what other people know, right?No. As it is fundamentally built as a language tool, it can SOMETIMES form very convincing and plausible sounding sentences regardless of how nonsensical it can be. This common problem is called Artificial Intelligence Hallucinations. It needs time to learn over time, through upvotes or downvotes plus some additional feedback from humans.Does that mean that ChatGPT will one day at least get the ""truth"" right? This is arguably the hardest thing even for us humans to do, even until today. Growing up, we subconsciously rank the quality of ""truth"" by how reliable the source of the information is. We ranked our teachers as reliable, and a stranger (for example) as unreliable. Let's break this down mathematically. If we think our teacher is 5x more reliable than a stranger, it'll take 6 strangers to make us doubt our teacher. Sounds reasonable? Amid all the different voices online, it can sometimes be challenging for us to differentiate the ""truths"" from the bent ones.3. Some current limitations.Bewear of typos.ChatGPT isn't too tolerant with typos. If you didn't even notice the typo at the beginning of this paragraph, it's because us humans are a lot more adaptable and tolerant to mistakes. We are capable of ""autocorrecting"" in real time, and with context. Computer systems are very literal. It assumes you are literal about what you're asking it. Garbage in, garbage out. Literally as simple as that.4. Use cases and potentials.Having said that, there are many uses for ChatGPT or other AI systems that I am very excited about. Ask it to find erroneous lines of software codes, it'll do well. It isn't ambiguous and relative to the person asking. From debugging software to writing essays, I think you've read enough great examples of AI's capabilities and accomplishments.I'm keeping a very keen eye on its development, and I think I might have identified a few industries and use cases for it. I'll be experimenting with my circle of friends and post our progress here.Stay tuned.#ai#chatgpt#artificialintelligence#development",0.9414,0.443576388888889,12 ,19,8

Alexandra Ilie,15-03-2023,"Ce nu știi despre mine?Am lucrat ca și registrator medical și ca și coordonator de call center într-o clinică medicală privată /spital privat, timp de aproape 5 ani.Am avut o echipă de 26 de femei frumoase și deștepte în subordine, care m-au ajutat să mă dezvolt mult. M-au scos din zona mea de confort de nenumărate ori.Am avut colegi, medici, extrem de umani și de dedicați în ceea ce fac 🙏🙏🙏, pe care îi apreciez enorm, dar și colegi care și-au uitat motivația pentru care au început să lucreze în vindecarea și ajutarea oamenilor.În urma acestei experiențe, am știut clar cu ce fel de energie vreau să lucrez mai departe și ce anume nu mai doresc, dar și de ce și cum vreau să ajut oamenii mai departe. Prefer să lucrez cu femeile, mai ales de când sunt mămică, pentru că rezonez mult cu energia feminină, cu multitaskingul, cu multitudinea de responsabilități, de griji și printre picături cu îngrijirea lor personală, care ar fi trebuit să fie o prioritate pentru ele, pentru a putea fi cea mai bună versiune a lor în raport cu ceilalți.Cred că medicina alternativă nu poate să o excludă pe cea tradițională și invers, există un echilibru în cele două și se susțin reciproc, așa cum inima nu poate exclude mintea și invers.În urma experienței mele, cred tot mai mult că oamenii au nevoie să-și identifice pasiunile și să se ocupe de ceea ce sunt pasionați cu adevărat, ca să facă o treabă minunată, așa nu simt oboseală, sunt consecvenți, disciplinați și asumați în ceea ce fac.Putem face multe lucruri bine, dar putem excela doar în acele lucruri care sunt în aliniament cu inima, sufletul și mintea noastră.Tu ce părere ai?#traiestefrumos#alexandrailie#pasiune#selfcare#hairstylist",0.9563,0.05,0,0,0

Aquí algunos de los motivos por los que Google Search está en declive:🔍 Los resultados de búsqueda han empeorado por un SEO agresivo que en muchos casos llevan al usuario a resultados poco útiles.📊 Resultados de web de afiliados o publicidad donde la información es escasa y la pantalla está llena de sitios donde clicar.🔮 Resultados personalizados para los usuarios que crean una burbuja donde cada uno recibe la información que refuerza sus opiniones y creencias previas, lo que limita el acceso a la diversidad de información.❓ Google intenta adivinar lo que realmente quiere decir el usuario, en lugar de mostrar resultados para las palabras exactas que el usuario busca.🔄 Los cambios en los algoritmos de búsqueda muchas veces producen que sitios relevantes y con información de calidad desaparezcan de la primera página.🤖 Con el aumento de la desinformación y el contenido generado por IA, cada vez es más difícil para Google distinguir entre contenido auténtico y de calidad y contenido falso o de baja calidad.📱 Muchos usuarios utilizan redes sociales o aplicaciones especializadas para hacer las búsquedas (como Tik Tok o Amazon).🔒 Muchos usuarios preocupados por la privacidad utilizan otros buscadores o ad-blockers y bloqueo de rastreadores.🎤 Cada vez más se utilizan los asistentes de voz para hacer búsquedas (Alexa, Siri...)¿Añadirías algún motivo más?

However, the demands of full-time study and other obligations left me feeling like it was just a far-fetched dream. But in December of 2022, I decided to take action and live by the mantra ""Why Not?""(Thank You, Russell Westbrook)I had always made small wood products that didn't require much risk but Iused this phrase to break free from the hesitation that had kept me from starting commissioned projects I had been meaning to do for ages. So I decided to create my own woodworking company, NYMBRO, and my first project was a desk for a close friend.It wasn't easy, especially with the high cost of renting workshop space and the challenge of transporting supplies. But I was determined to do the best I could with what I had. In the tiny foyer of my apartment, I spent the next six days building the three-level desk, complete with an integrated neon light controlled by Alexa or Siri and cable management blocks for my friend's cables.This project was a symbol of two things for me: First, taking a step even when the path is unclear is often the best option. Second, it represented the mission of NYMBRO, which is to be the intersection of woodworking and technology, making ideas tangible.Starting NYMBRO was a huge leap of faith, but I knew that it was worth the risk.

Abdullahi Abdulbasid,15-03-2023,"""Natural Language Processing: The Future of Communication"":Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP is enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, thus making communication between humans and machines more seamless.NLP has many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated systems such as Siri and Alexa. These systems use NLP to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. NLP can also be used to analyze large amounts of textual data, such as social media posts, emails, and customer reviews.One of the key challenges in NLP is understanding the nuances of human language, such as idioms, sarcasm, and context. NLP systems must be able to understand the meaning behind words and phrases, and interpret them correctly. This requires the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, to process and analyze large amounts of data.Another important aspect of NLP is natural language generation, which involves using AI to generate human-like language. This technology can be used in various applications, such as writing news articles, creating chatbot responses, and generating personalized emails.NLP is also being used in healthcare to analyze medical records and patient data to improve diagnosis and treatment. NLP systems can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to humans. This can help healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans.Overall, NLP has the potential to transform the way we communicate with machines and each other. As NLP technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see more widespread adoption of chatbots, virtual assistants, and other NLP applications in our daily lives. NLP is poised to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, customer service, and marketing.In conclusion, NLP is a rapidly growing field that is revolutionizing the way we communicate with machines. As NLP technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more advanced and sophisticated applications of this technology in various industries. NLP has the potential to make communication more seamless, efficient, and personalized, thereby improving our overall quality of life.#machinelearning#data#ai#healthcare#artificialintelligence#medical",0.9877,0.4965045592705168,0,0,0

Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt.

Điều này là chỉ là sự ngẫu nhiên hay có một lí do nào đó phía sau?Mặc dù hầu hết các trợ lý ảo đều có thể được cài đặt tuỳ chỉnh sao cho phù hợp với yêu cầu của người sử dụng nhưng mặc định trợ lý ảo trên các thiết bị sẽ là giọng nữ. Điều này đơn giản là vì con người ta có xu hướng ưa chuộng giọng nữ giới nói hơn, một nghiên cứu khoa học đã chỉ ra rằng giọng nữ giới tạo cảm giác mềm mại, dịu dàng. Hơn nữa vì chúng ta được tiếp xúc với giọng của nữ giới ngay từ khi còn ở trong bụng mẹ nên sẽ cảm thấy gần gũi, thân quen hơn.Một nghiên cứu khác cũng chỉ ra rằng phụ nữ có thể phát âm những nguyên âm rõ ràng hơn nam giới, qua đó góp phần truyền tải chính xác thông tin giúp cho giọng nữ trở nên dễ nghe hơn. Những lý do trên đã khiến cho giọng nói nữ giới trở thành sự lựa chọn hàng đầu để áp dụng cho các trợ lý ảo.Với Trợ lý ảo VinFast được phát triển bởi VinBigData, người dùng có thể giao tiếp tự nhiên thông qua 4 giọng tiêu chuẩn (nam/nữ miền Bắc và nam/nữ miền Nam) là các MC/BTV nổi tiếng của VTV. Tuy nhiên, giọng nói mặc định trong lần đầu “làm quen” cùng xe được lựa chọn là giọng đọc của BTV Hoài Anh - một trong những nữ MC “quốc dân” của Việt Nam.Còn các bạn thấy sao?

Is this just a coincidence or is there a reason behind it?Although most virtual assistants can be customized to suit the user's wants, the default selection will mostly be female. This is simply because humans prefer female voices, a scientific study has shown that female voices create a soft, gentle feeling. Moreover, we are exposed to female voices from the early stages of our lives hence we will feel closer and more familiar.Another study also showed that women can articulate vowels more clearly than men which makes female voices easier to hear. Therefore, female voices tend to be the first choice for virtual assistants.With VinFast Virtual Assistant developed by VinBigData, users can communicate naturally via 4 standard voices (Northern male/female and Southern male/female) which belong to renowned MCs of VTV. Especially, the default voice on Vinfast cars was dubbed by Hoai Anh - one of the ""national"" female MCs of Vietnam.Which voice is more like “the music to your ears”?

However, the devices didn't gain much traction, and the idea remained dormant until Apple released the iPad in 2010, which revolutionized the tablet market.- Smartphones and mobile operating systems: Microsoft developed Windows Mobile and later Windows Phone as mobile operating systems to compete with iOS and Android. Despite its early presence in the mobile market, Microsoft failed to gain significant market share and eventually discontinued Windows Phone. Meanwhile, iOS and Android continued to dominate the smartphone market.- Wearable technology: Microsoft introduced the SPOT (Smart Personal Objects Technology) watch in 2004, a smartwatch that could display news, weather, and other information. The project was discontinued in 2008. A few years later, companies like Apple, Samsung, and Fitbit successfully launched their own smartwatches and fitness trackers, creating a thriving wearable technology market.- Virtual assistants: Microsoft's Cortana, introduced in 2014, was an early player in the virtual assistant market. However, it failed to gain significant traction compared to competitors like Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple's Siri. While Cortana still exists, its presence and impact in the virtual assistant market are relatively limited.Personally, I am not jumping with excitement when big companies are announcing their involvement in some#web3technology because most of them and their practices, are the reason why this technology exists - but do I use it as social proof to encourage others to try it?

Joseph Babi,15-03-2023,"""Hey Google... Hey Siri... Alexa""Do you catch yourself saying these phrases during your day?As voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant become more ubiquitous, voice search is quickly becoming the new frontier of search engine optimization (SEO). In fact, in 2022, it's estimated that voice searches accounted for half of all online searches.But how can you optimize your website for voice search? Here are some tips:1. Use conversational keywords: People speak differently than they type, so it's essential to use conversational keywords and long-tail phrases that match how people talk.2. Optimize for featured snippets: Many voice assistants use featured snippets (also known as position zero) to provide answers to voice search queries. Optimizing your content to appear in featured snippets can increase your chances of appearing in voice search results.3. Focus on local search: Many voice searches are location-based, so optimizing for local SEO can increase your visibility in voice search results.4. Improve website speed: Voice assistants prefer websites that load quickly, so it's crucial to optimize your website's speed for better voice search rankings.By optimizing your website for voice search, you can increase your chances of appearing in voice search results and reaching a new audience of potential customers.

Andrea Petrucci,15-03-2023,"Interesting take on the status of Digital Assistants after the release of ChatGPT. Amazon seems to have failed to fully monetise the Alexa product, and that's despite being it used more widely than Apple's and Google's assistants.They report Satya Nadella as saying:“They were all dumb as a rock,” Nadella told the Financial Times last month. “Whether it’s Cortana or Alexa or Google Assistant or Siri, all these just don’t work. We had a product that was supposed to be the new front-end to a lot of [information] that didn’t work.”And while that might be true, some see a possible renaissance ahead for voice assistants.",-0.1027,0.3973829201101928,0,0,0
ribbit_ oficial,15-03-2023,"Cómo crear un chatbot humanizado para tu marca en la era del Chat GPT¿Qué es un chatbot humanizado?Un chatbot humanizado es un software que simula la forma en la que los humanos interactúan, pero lo hace entre una máquina y un usuario. Al igual que los chatbots tradicionales, su principal función es la de favorecer el autoservicio y permitir la resolución de problemas 24/7 y a escala. Por su parte, ambos tipos de chatbots se diferencian por la manera en la que se comunican con los clientes para lograr el objetivo ya mencionado.Humanizar una conversación significa que el bot buscará respuestas y formas de expresarse, que se sientan lo más naturales posible y que tengan la capacidad de involucrar al usuario de la misma manera que lo haría un agente humano -pero con mucha más escala y velocidad de lo que lo haría una persona de carne y hueso.Un buen ejemplo de automatización humanizada son Siri o Alexa. Ambos asistentes virtuales cumplen con su cometido, responder a las preguntas de los usuarios y automatizar algunas tareas, pero tienen personalidades muy definidas e incluso puede llegar a convertirse casi que en humoristas por momentos. Ambos afamados asistentes virtuales actúan casi como lo harían personas reales en medio de una conversación.Para llegar a un nivel tan avanzado de humanización es necesario un trabajo masivo de mapeo del lenguaje humano y de las potenciales y más frecuentes intenciones de los usuarios. Por fortuna, los chatbots se presentan como opciones un tanto más sencillas de implementar, pero igualmente efectivas por su carisma y capacidad de atraer y retener a los clientes.Un punto interesante a tener en cuenta es que un chatbot humanizado no siempre es la mejor opción para tu empresa. Según estudios conducidos por la investigadora Rhonda Hadi, de la Universidad de Oxford, la humanización aumenta la satisfacción de los clientes en términos generales, pero si están enojados o molestos, el efecto será inverso.Para garantizar que un chabot sea realmente humanizado, es esencial que este sea creado mediante el uso de inteligencia artificial y de machine learning. De esta forma, podrá comprender y mejorar sus habilidades de habla e interacción y crear conversaciones cada vez más naturales y contextualizadas.¡Salta a la transformación digital!¡Contáctanos!www.ribbit.com.mxFuente:https://lnkd.in/g-bDqXasFoto de Pradamas Gifarry en Unsplash#digital#software#inteligenciaartificial#ribbit",-0.4184,1.0,0,1,2

Mohamed Salah,15-03-2023,"Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are changing the game when it comes to voice search. By using these tools, users can ask for information or perform tasks without having to type out a query. As a result, businesses need to start thinking about how they can optimize their content for these platforms.Successful voice search optimization for virtual assistants involves understanding the way people use these tools and creating content that is tailored to their needs. For example, users often use natural language when speaking to virtual assistants, so it's important to create content that answers common questions in a conversational way.If you're looking to reach potential customers through virtual assistants, start by thinking about the types of questions they might ask. Then, create content that answers those questions in a clear and concise manner. You can also optimize your website for voice search by using structured data markup to provide additional context for search engines.Overall, virtual assistants are revolutionizing voice search, and businesses that don't adapt risk falling behind.

The listings that are seeing the most success are prime properties with good locations and either newer construction or significant updating – Buyers are looking for turn-key properties. These homes generally sell in the first 7 days on the market, and Sellers are achieving their list price and sometimes exceeding their list price due to multiple offers. Average sales prices have increased by 13.7% over this time last year. For the properties that don’t sell immediately, the average days on the market for single-family homes is 57, up from 20 days this time last year.

Swapnil Amin,15-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0

Sami Hotak,14-03-2023,"Are ChatGPT and NLP a threat to programming and software engineering jobs?It seems that current thinking is that ChatGPT and other NLP technology available today are not going to immediately make all coders, programmers, and software engineers redundant.For a start, it can only create relatively simple programs. Ask it for something too complex – such as a sophisticated game or business application, and it will admit its weakness and tell you that the task is currently beyond its abilities.Computers can't yet tell us, for example, what types of code or applications are needed to achieve what we are trying to do. Even if it knows this because we tell it, then ChatGPT, in particular, can’t (at the moment) attempt to create this software that specifically gives us as users a competitive edge over users of another piece of software.For example, we can't tell it to ""make me an e-commerce platform that's more effective at selling than Amazon."" If we wanted this, then we still have to spend the time and effort to first work out what makes Amazon's platform so great and then find a way of doing it better.Due to this, ChatGPT (and other current NLP-based tools) still have limited effectiveness when it comes to creating software designed to give us an edge in business or, indeed, to compete with human creativity and ingenuity.One caveat here is that although we can do our best to extrapolate what might happen in the future, in reality, no-one has a crystal ball. It’s fair to say that a lot of people who were used to AI conversing at the level of Alexa or Siri were somewhat shocked by how good ChatGPT is.Future developments could indeed increase the speed with which we are traveling towards a point in time where human programmers – or many other types of professionals – will simply not be needed. For the time being, however, we can be confident that there is still a wide range of skills required to develop software that computers don’t seem likely to be able to replicate any time soon.Source:Forbes Magzine",0.9809,0.4963169642857143,0,1,0
Payal Rajani,14-03-2023,"Attention all e-commerce enthusiasts! The future of online shopping is upon us, and it's going to be a game-changer. Over the next five years, we can expect to see some exciting new trends and innovations in the e-commerce industry that will revolutionize the way we shop.Firstly, the rise of mobile commerce is set to continue. With more and more people using their smartphones and tablets to browse and shop online, retailers will need to focus on mobile optimization to ensure that their websites and apps are fully responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens. This means simplifying checkout processes, streamlining navigation, and optimizing content for smaller screens.Another trend we can expect to see in the near future is the integration of augmented reality into the e-commerce experience.Augmented reality (AR) allows users to visualize products in a real-world environment, enabling them to see how a product will look and feel before making a purchase. This technology has the potential to significantly increase customer satisfaction and reduce the number of returns, as shoppers will have a better understanding of what they're buying.In addition to AR, we can also expect to see the rise of voice search in e-commerce. Voice-activated assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are becoming increasingly popular, and retailers will need to optimize their product listings to be compatible with these devices. This means using natural language and long-tail keywords to ensure that their products are easily searchable via voice commands.Finally, we can expect to see continued growth in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in e-commerce. These technologies can be used to analyze customer data, predict buying patterns, and personalize the shopping experience for each individual customer. This means that retailers will be able to offer highly targeted promotions and recommendations to customers, increasing their chances of making a sale.In conclusion, the future of e-commerce is looking bright, with exciting new trends and innovations set to transform the industry over the next five years. From mobile commerce and augmented reality to voice search and artificial intelligence, retailers will need to stay ahead of the curve to succeed in this rapidly evolving landscape.

But instead of being inside a person's head, it's inside a computer or a robot.AI is really good at doing things that require a lot of thinking, like recognizing faces or voices, playing games, or helping us find information on the internet. It learns and gets better at these things over time, just like how we get better at something the more we practice it.Think about when you play a video game and the computer characters seem to be playing against you. That's AI at work! Or when you talk to a virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa and they can answer your questions, that's AI too.But just like how we need to learn and practice to get better at something, AI needs to be taught and trained by humans.

David J. Wilson,14-03-2023,"Good morning! Are you interested in learning more about 2023’s most talked-about technology? 🧐Yes, I'm talking about the exciting world of generative AI, and its potential to transform industries and create new forms of content. Look at my first comment a link to this complete article byMcKinsey & Company, which explains the basics of#generativeaiand its many practical applications.Let me highlight here some key points:➡ Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulation, and even videos. In the category of machine learning, it generates all kinds of new content, such as articles where the grammar is perfect, the tone works, and the narrative flows, or music and art that really make sense.➡#chatgpt—the GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer—it’s a free chatbot that can generate an answer to almost any question it’s asked. And DALL-E is a tool for AI-generated art. ChatGPT is being developed by a team of researchers and engineers at OpenAI, a research organization dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence in a safe and beneficial manner, ChatGPT was first announced and made available to developers in June 2020, and then released for testing to the public on November 30, 2022. As you can see in the image byInsider Intelligence, over a million people signed up to use it in just five days, a new record for user acquisition (Source:Data.ai). Computer code, essays, poems, and even jokes, are examples of what fans have posted while interacting with this chatbot (me included).➡ AI is the practice of getting machines to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks. For instance, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are based on AI technology. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence. Through ML, practitioners develop AI through models that can “learn” from data patterns without human direction. The huge volume and complexity of data have increased the potential for machine learning, as well as the need for it.➡ Machine learning is founded on several building blocks, as our way of transforming your business model atCeibo Digital, starting with classical statistical techniques developed between the 18th and 20th centuries for small data sets. In the 1930s and 1940s, computer pioneers such as Alan Turing began working on the basic techniques for machine learning. Does anyone remember the Turing Machine?➡ Until recently, machine learning was largely limited to predictive models, used to observe, and classify patterns in content. Generative AI was a breakthrough. Instead of perceiving and classifying a photo, machine learning is now able to create an image or text description on its own.Generative AI has the power to transform the way we live and work, and ChatGPT is just one example of the incredible possibilities it offers.

Gaston Algaze,14-03-2023,"During the last couple of months I’ve been trying out ChatGPT, making sure to do it in a way that would go beyond the novelty, trying to address real life challenges.This is what I found.1. It’s relatively easy to use, I can see it embedded in almost every aspect of our daily life. Imagine a smarter Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant.While not entirely smooth yet, it will solve most of the hurdles of modern life. All simple questions will be answered, not googled, answered right here right now.2. There’s a chance people will become more stupid, by relying on AI as people rely today on a GPS to drive everywhere. Experience will still matter, but if we remove people from building such experience, then we’re really putting our own evolution into the AI’s hands.3. Will my job be impacted by this technology? 100% Yes. Will I lose my job? Look if you’re questioning yourself today whether you’re going to lose your job or not, then you probably will. The question is not whether you’ll lose it or not, the question is how you can take this new tool and apply it to make it your own.4. I’m pretty sure this will accelerate the lifecycle of many technologies, products and even cultures. We’re looking at the next real evolutionary stage. And something people don't realize, is that this started not with ChatGPT but many years ago with thousands of other models. AI is coming to stay and we will need to adapt.So now you know what I think the next few years will bring. What's fascinating is that we brought ChatGPT to life by programming it to mirror our own thoughts and expressions. We're now entering a new era where humans won't be the only ones creating things that are uniquely human. There's a growing similarity between the products of human creativity and those of AI. We're even starting to adopt some machine-like characteristics, which makes it easier for robots to learn from us. It's exciting to imagine how humans and robots will work in tandem to achieve incredible feats in the future.So, how do you think AI will impact your world? I'd really like to hear your thoughts...#technology#ai#experience#people#work",0.9835,0.490012225428892,0,23,0
Jasmine Moore,14-03-2023,"🖐🏾Hi Jazzy Engineers and AI Enthusiast,📎Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a buzzword in recent years, with applications ranging from self-driving cars to personal assistants like Siri and Alexa and now chatGPT. However, the accuracy of AI has been the subject of much debate and controversy, particularly when it comes to using it for critical applications such as medical diagnosis or financial predictions. I've asked chatGPT to assist me in shedding some light on how AI learns and how its accuracy can be improved through the process of deep learning.ChatGPT says, 🤖""Hey there, Jazzy engineers! Are you wondering how I, an AI language model, learns? It's all thanks to a process called deep learning, which is a fancy way of saying I can learn from large amounts of data by building complex mathematical models.Let me break it down for you. First, I'm fed input data that's preprocessed and transformed into a numerical representation. Then, I'm trained using an algorithm that adjusts the parameters of the mathematical model to minimize the difference between my predictions and the true output values.During training, I learn from my mistakes through a process called backpropagation. It's kind of like how you learn from your mistakes and adjust your approach. Once I'm trained, I can make predictions on new data that I haven't seen before. This is called inference.So, the next time you ask me a question or give me some input, know that I'm using my deep learning abilities to process it and give you the best response I can.""⚜Many of us imagine AI the way its depicted in movies, causing a lot of confusion and misunderstanding about how useful AI can be and how ""intelligent"" the technology actually is.

Mariusz Korba,14-03-2023,"Voice Recognition has slipped under your radar!While everyone is talking about ChatGPT, the voice recognition model Whisper (also by OpenAI) might have been underestimated.We all know Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. But equally, I think many, myself included, are underwhelmed by their accuracy, pushing us back to speak to them with somewhat robotic commands or moving back to typing.At the same time, many people who tried to use ChatGPT found it somewhat inaccurate. Still, I can bet that at least some of that inaccuracy is because they didn't write enough contextual information for the AI to understand the question entirely.I think that with accurate voice recognition, the potential us having a meaningful and precise conversation is much more impressive.With accurate speech ➡️ text will come accurate text ➡️ speech. Take Eleven Labs - their model can understand the context of a text, and with proper voice recognition, it can speak back to you with the tone you'd expect based on the context of that text.So, using Whisper to transcribe our question, GPT to form an accurate and comprehensive response, and the Event Labs to convincingly speak back to us could take our conversations with technology to another level. This would make them more human-like, accurate, and finally useful. Sure, these tools still make some mistakes, but they'll become more capable and helpful with time, and we can already see this.In a business environment, you can imagine meetings/calls where AI automatically takes notes and minutes, extracting key facts, actions, new ideas and who started them. Such notes can then be summarised and even written with the preferred level of detail based on each stakeholder's seniority, needs, knowledge, and interests. Each person can then listen to such a summary at their leisure, making it easier and quicker to digest, like listening to an audiobook vs reading a book - all automatic 🤖.In fact, with OpenAI recently releasing APIs, you don't need to imagine this. Instead, you can implement such a workflow now!Naturally, there will be many more helpful use cases, but, like with any new technology, privacy concerns will be, and should be, raised as well.#ai#artificialintelligence#future",0.9897,0.4580457351290685,0,5,0

How do you hire for it, grow your team into it, or become one?I loved working with my co-author Polly M. Allen who is the founder for AICareerboost and was Principal AI Product Manager on Alexa to write this article. If you don't have time for the full article, here's the cheat sheet summary (and no, not ChatGPT was NOT involved):ARTICLE TAKEAWAYS- AI Product Management is a new area of specialization of Product Management, similar to specializations like ‘Growth PM’ or ‘GTM PM’ in its reliance on specialized skills, that relates to developing and managing products that leverage AI.- AI Product Managers require traditional core product management skills - being able to identify the right problem, and being able to deliver the right solution - with additional depth in software engineering, data-centric skills, communication and risk management.- Hiring and development of AI Product talent depends on the stage of your project. For discovery-stage initiatives, emphasize user knowledge and domain expertise. For optimizing and scaling, look for technical depth and data-driven decision-making.- Develop technical knowledge in domain-expert PMs by pairing them with AI technologists during planning. Develop user empathy in more technical PMs with data analysis of usage patterns, and pairing them with user research teams.- Many AI initiatives have been technology led, leading to a bias to hiring AI technologists as PMs rather than upskilling domain experts or optimization-focused PMs in AI. Organizations need to invest in developing AI knowledge in their product teams to fully take advantage of the latest innovations in AI.hashtag#productmanagement#ai",0.7924,0.4956574675324675,0,0,0

I would love to express my gratitude to him as well for such a wonderful session.He talked about the enormous potential of the autonomous world to make or break the modern era. The prime focus of the session was on a part of AI that we sometimes shy away from talking about, which is ""What Can Possibly Go Wrong?""AI is largely statistical, and its reliability can sometimes be questionable. He elaborated on the common pitfalls of ML modeling, including how crucial it is to obtain the right training data and how over-generalization of models can be bad.ML systems are happy to be biased if it means producing good results. It's astonishing to see how Algorithmic bias and Societal bias can show up in ML models. These biases in autonomous systems can be catastrophic and it is critical that we are careful with the handling of systems like these.The human-machine interaction is growing exponentially, and it's high time we look at the other side of the coin, which is AI .Tony Dahburaposed an intriguing question: ""If humans should have the right to know when they are interacting with a machine.

Ahmadreza Sazegarnejad,15-03-2023,"There is a lot to discuss about ethical AI, this is a simple one:From the text:“When you text your friend a joke and they reply with three tears-of-joy emojis, your body responds with endorphins and oxytocin as you revel in the knowledge that your friend is amused.Our instinctive reaction to AI-generated emojis is likely to be the same, even though there is no human emotion at the other end. We can be deceived into responding to, and feeling empathy for, an inanimate object.”And also:“My worry is that, without appropriate safeguards, such technology could undermine people’s autonomy. AIs that ‘emote’ could induce us to make harmful mistakes by harnessing the power of our empathic responses. The dangers are already apparent. When one ten-year-old asked Amazon’s Alexa for a challenge, it told her to touch a penny to a live electrical outlet. Luckily, the girl didn’t follow Alexa’s advice, but a generative AI could be much more persuasive. Less dramatically, an AI could shame you into buying an expensive product you don’t want.

Abdullahi Abdulbasid,15-03-2023,"""Natural Language Processing: The Future of Communication"":Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP is enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, thus making communication between humans and machines more seamless.NLP has many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated systems such as Siri and Alexa. These systems use NLP to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. NLP can also be used to analyze large amounts of textual data, such as social media posts, emails, and customer reviews.One of the key challenges in NLP is understanding the nuances of human language, such as idioms, sarcasm, and context. NLP systems must be able to understand the meaning behind words and phrases, and interpret them correctly. This requires the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, to process and analyze large amounts of data.Another important aspect of NLP is natural language generation, which involves using AI to generate human-like language. This technology can be used in various applications, such as writing news articles, creating chatbot responses, and generating personalized emails.NLP is also being used in healthcare to analyze medical records and patient data to improve diagnosis and treatment. NLP systems can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to humans. This can help healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans.Overall, NLP has the potential to transform the way we communicate with machines and each other. As NLP technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see more widespread adoption of chatbots, virtual assistants, and other NLP applications in our daily lives. NLP is poised to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, customer service, and marketing.In conclusion, NLP is a rapidly growing field that is revolutionizing the way we communicate with machines. As NLP technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more advanced and sophisticated applications of this technology in various industries. NLP has the potential to make communication more seamless, efficient, and personalized, thereby improving our overall quality of life.#machinelearning#data#ai#healthcare#artificialintelligence#medical",0.9877,0.4965045592705168,0,0,0

Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt.

Nazmul Hassan,15-03-2023,"Search engine optimization (SEO) is constantly evolving as search engines like Google refine their algorithms and new technologies emerge. Here are some possible trends that could shape the future of SEO:Focus on user intent: As search engines become more sophisticated, they are better able to understand the intent behind a user's search query. This means that optimizing for keywords alone is no longer enough. Instead, SEO will increasingly be about understanding what users are looking for and providing them with relevant content and experiences.Importance of voice search: With the rise of smart speakers and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, voice search is becoming more prevalent. SEO strategies will need to adapt to the unique challenges and opportunities of voice search, such as optimizing for natural language queries and local search.Emphasis on mobile-first indexing: More and more people are accessing the internet on their mobile devices, which has led to Google shifting towards mobile-first indexing. This means that websites that are not optimized for mobile devices may suffer in search rankings. SEO will need to prioritize mobile optimization to ensure visibility in search results.Integration with other channels: SEO is increasingly being integrated with other marketing channels, such as social media, email marketing, and content marketing. A holistic approach that considers how SEO fits into the larger marketing picture will be important.Overall, the future of SEO will likely continue to be shaped by advancements in technology and changes in user behavior. SEO professionals will need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and adapt their strategies accordingly to remain effective.#searchengines#seo#marketing#searchengineoptimization#contentmarketing#technology",0.9726,0.5490143784786643,0,0,0

Der#APIZugang ist leider noch nicht voll möglich, wird aber in den nächsten Tagen folgen.Was ist anders? Die Qualität hat sich deutlich gesteigert, höherer „Faktengenauigkeit“, die Textausgaben sind menschlicher und nicht so gleichmäßig wie vorher. Wobei ihr das auch per Eingabeaufforderung selber steuern könnt.Ich kann also auch einen Text für einen Viertklässler, in Reimform oder mit bestimmten Buchstaben- / Satzkonstruktionen umschreiben lassen. Auch eine Ausgabe in sehr einfacher Sprache ist möglich.Was sehr spannend ist: ich kann verschiedene Medien als Input nutzen. Ein Beispiel: Ich nutze ein Foto von allen Lebensmitteln die ich habe, und frage was ich damit für Gerichte kochen kann. Ich bekomme so eine Liste mit Gerichten und kann mir daraus dann ein Rezept aussuchen.Ich kann ebenfalls eine Toneingabe nutzen, bekomme als quasi einen (halben) Voicebot wie Alexa direkt mitgeliefert.Noch interessanter: Stimmungen von Menschen können eingefangen werden, wenn ihr Fotos als Eingabe verwendet.Wenn ich also weiß, dass jemand gerade wütend oder traurig ist, kann ich ihm einen Inhalt anders zur Verfügung stellen, als wenn er glücklich oder positiv aufgeregt ist.Aber was hat das alles mit#sparkassezu tun?Wir wollen eine völlig neue Art des Kundendialogs schaffen, der nur mit dem Einsatz von#KImöglich ist, und uns ermöglicht unsere 40.000.000 Kunden sehr emotionalisiert anzusprechen.

RiseUpp,15-03-2023,"EVERYTHING YOU DO NOW, AI WILL DO FOR YOUArtificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way since its inception and has now become an integral part of our daily lives. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI has impacted various industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail, among others. As AI continues to evolve, it's becoming more apparent that it has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more.Let's take a closer look at some of the jobs that AI can do, both simple and advanced:Simple Jobs:👉 Data Entry: AI algorithms can be programmed to recognize and input data from various sources, including forms, surveys, and spreadsheets.👉 Customer Service: Chatbots and virtual assistants can handle basic customer inquiries and support tasks.👉 Social Media Management: AI can analyze social media trends, create posts, and even respond to comments and messages.👉 Personal Shopping: AI can analyze shopping behaviour and preferences to make personalized recommendations for users.👉 Traffic Control: AI can help manage traffic patterns by monitoring traffic flow and suggesting alternative routes in real-time.Advanced Jobs:👉 Medical Diagnosis: AI can analyze medical images and data to help doctors diagnose diseases and conditions.👉 Legal Research: AI algorithms can analyze legal documents and cases to assist lawyers with research and case preparation.👉 Financial Analysis: AI can analyze financial data to help investors make informed decisions.👉 Creative Writing: AI can generate creative writing, including articles, poetry, and even entire novels.👉 Robotics: AI-powered robots can perform complex tasks, including assembling products and performing surgical procedures.While AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve our lives, there are also concerns about its impact on the job market. As AI becomes more advanced, it's likely to take over many jobs that were traditionally performed by humans. However, it's important to note that AI is not here to replace humans, but rather to assist and augment human capabilities.To prepare for the future of work, it's essential to embrace the potential of AI and focus on developing skills that complement what AI can do. This includes developing critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence, which are all skills that AI cannot replicate.In conclusion, AI has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more. While this may be concerning to some, it's important to remember that AI is here to assist and augment human capabilities. To prepare for the future of work, it's important to embrace AI and focus on developing skills that complement what AI can do, ultimately leading to a more productive and efficient workforce.#FutureOfWork#ArtificialIntelligence#Automation#Upskilling#Reskilling#Adaptability#Innovation#DigitalTransformation#JobMarket",0.9873,0.4997835497835498,0,2,0

VinBigData,15-03-2023,"[English below]💁🏻‍♀️ TẠI SAO PHẦN LỚN TRỢ LÝ ẢO ĐỀU ĐƯỢC MẶC ĐỊNH LÀ GIỌNG NÓI CỦA NỮ GIỚI?Hãy thử nói chuyện với bất kì trợ lý ảo nào mà bạn có xung quanh mình, cho dù là Siri, Alexa hay Cortana thì rất nhiều khả năng sẽ có một giọng nói nữ giới trả lời các yêu cầu của bạn. Điều này là chỉ là sự ngẫu nhiên hay có một lí do nào đó phía sau?Mặc dù hầu hết các trợ lý ảo đều có thể được cài đặt tuỳ chỉnh sao cho phù hợp với yêu cầu của người sử dụng nhưng mặc định trợ lý ảo trên các thiết bị sẽ là giọng nữ. Điều này đơn giản là vì con người ta có xu hướng ưa chuộng giọng nữ giới nói hơn, một nghiên cứu khoa học đã chỉ ra rằng giọng nữ giới tạo cảm giác mềm mại, dịu dàng. Hơn nữa vì chúng ta được tiếp xúc với giọng của nữ giới ngay từ khi còn ở trong bụng mẹ nên sẽ cảm thấy gần gũi, thân quen hơn.Một nghiên cứu khác cũng chỉ ra rằng phụ nữ có thể phát âm những nguyên âm rõ ràng hơn nam giới, qua đó góp phần truyền tải chính xác thông tin giúp cho giọng nữ trở nên dễ nghe hơn. Những lý do trên đã khiến cho giọng nói nữ giới trở thành sự lựa chọn hàng đầu để áp dụng cho các trợ lý ảo.Với Trợ lý ảo VinFast được phát triển bởi VinBigData, người dùng có thể giao tiếp tự nhiên thông qua 4 giọng tiêu chuẩn (nam/nữ miền Bắc và nam/nữ miền Nam) là các MC/BTV nổi tiếng của VTV. Tuy nhiên, giọng nói mặc định trong lần đầu “làm quen” cùng xe được lựa chọn là giọng đọc của BTV Hoài Anh - một trong những nữ MC “quốc dân” của Việt Nam.Còn các bạn thấy sao? Giọng nam hay nữ sẽ “nịnh tai” các bạn hơn? Để lại comment/reaction bên dưới nhé!------------Trải nghiệm hệ sinh thái của VinBigData:→ Website:https://vinbigdata.com/→ Linkedin:https://bit.ly/3g7IhDQ→ Youtube:https://bit.ly/3vMS88X→ Blog:https://lnkd.in/dMgbeqNh------------💁🏻‍♀️ WHY ARE VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS' VOICES MOSTLY FEMALE?Try talking to any virtual assistant around you, whether it's Siri, Alexa, or Cortana, chances are a female voice will answer your requests. Is this just a coincidence or is there a reason behind it?Although most virtual assistants can be customized to suit the user's wants, the default selection will mostly be female. This is simply because humans prefer female voices, a scientific study has shown that female voices create a soft, gentle feeling. Moreover, we are exposed to female voices from the early stages of our lives hence we will feel closer and more familiar.Another study also showed that women can articulate vowels more clearly than men which makes female voices easier to hear. Therefore, female voices tend to be the first choice for virtual assistants.With VinFast Virtual Assistant developed by VinBigData, users can communicate naturally via 4 standard voices (Northern male/female and Southern male/female) which belong to renowned MCs of VTV. Especially, the default voice on Vinfast cars was dubbed by Hoai Anh - one of the ""national"" female MCs of Vietnam.Which voice is more like “the music to your ears”?

Nicholas Peppas,15-03-2023,PVA GEL SAMPLES: 51 YEARS OLD AND GOING STRONG.Teaching Polymer Physics (ChE 379 and ChE 384T) this week while showing semicrystalline poly(vinyl alcohol) samples in the form of membranes and tubes (PVA gels swollen in deionized water and preserved with a few drops of formalin). The membranes shown are semicrystalline (15-20 vol% crystalline PVA) and exhibit ultimate tensile strengths of 20 MPa and elastic moduli of 150 MPa. But what is truly unusual is that these samples were made 51 years ago (in March 1972) and have been kept in DI water with formalin (changed often) since then.Thanks Alexa Anderson for the video.,0.6908,0.575,0,97,0

Trata-se de uma evolução da GPT-3.5, daOpenAI.Além de ter sido retreinada durante 6 meses com muito mais dados, o que mais me surpreendeu foi o fato da nova versão permitir o uso de imagens como input. No caso em questão, de uma simples anotação em um print (conforme imagem abaixo), ele foi capaz de gerar um website em HTML, atendendo as especificações.Acredito que é só o começo de uma infinidade de possibilidades de valor que as IA’s vão nos permitir gerar nos próximos anos.

Yeganeh Soltanpour,15-03-2023,"In today's rapidly evolving world, change is inevitable. When faced with change, one can either embrace it and learn from it, or risk missing out on the benefits it offers. This is especially true when it comes to the advancements in technology, such as ChatGPT, BingAI, and other similar tools that are now making their way into the mainstream. While these tools have been around for some time, their recent acceptance by the wider public has been remarkable. Nonetheless, there is a certain apprehension surrounding the use of AI, given its potential for harm.However, the application of AI to perform routine or menial tasks, which are often prone to human error or negligence, is an exciting development. By linking ChatGPT to my Alexa, for instance, I was able to easily access relevant articles pertaining to my field (which is how I came across the linked article). This is just one example of how AI can be utilised to enhance efficiency and accuracy in our day-to-day activities.Looking ahead, it is possible to envision AI being utilised in student visa applications. The potential benefits such as limiting the number of mistakes made, sometimes by students or agents, which can lead to delays in visa processing times may be something we can reduce. It is an exciting prospect, and one that we should all keep an eye on as we move forward.#ai#Chatgpt#aiforgood",0.9612,0.5962585034013606,2 ,9,0

She doesn’t want to go to school, mornings are very stressful for me. She has outbursts and tantrums getting ready for school and I don’t know what to do about it. I’m tired of lying to the school so she can go in late and get out early and miss school completely and I feel it’s only enabling her more. I understand and sympathize about how she feels but this is life and she needs to learn how to deal with it.

Trip O'Dell,15-03-2023,"As a designer, I find work like this ethically problematic.The robot is cute, but its designers are intentionally “playing” with a human cognitive bias where we treat things that look and behave like humans as if they are human.It was a line we were very careful not to cross when I was working at Amazon on Alexa. We even had a principle that “she” is a computer, not a person - because its very easy to wander into unethical areas when you have a device in your home that has your credit card number and can manipulate people who are lonely, or too trusting to act against their interests.As designers, a good bit of our work involves “lying” to users. A “user friendly” experience builds on familar metaphor, often representing functionality with a more familiar concept so people have an easier time using the software, and can anticipate how it might work.Consider the “trash can” on your computer, Its a helpful illusion for what happens to a file, but under the hood the root level command is something like “rm -i mydir/*”. The command is hard to remember, and requires a lot more advanced knowledge of the system to use it. So the illusion of a trash can, while innacurate, is a helpful illusion (lie) to help a normal user understand what’s happening.This isn’t the case here. The designers are creating an illusion of child-like behaviors, and eliciting our instinct to engage, nurture, play with and protect a child (notice the oversized head and big eyes?)…but its unclear why that’s necessary in this case, or to what end?This robot was developed by a multi-billion dollar corporation. Their business model depends on the “willing suspension of disbelief”. Disney needs us to love its characters and stories, to believe in “magic” and emotionally invest in their intellectual property to keep expensive theme parks and movie theaters filled, purchase their toys and subscribe to their services. They make great movies and world-class experiences but we know these things aren’t real. That isn’t what is happening here.The ethics of human-centered design requires we put people ahead of#technology, that the experiences we design are trustworthy, using metaphor and illusion only as a means to help users anticipate outcomes or understand the system they are working in.Disney is creating an illusion that evokes an emotional connection and engenders a sense of trust that the technology is incapable of  reciprocating. It can easily be used to manipulate us.Playing with our emotional response is uncomfortably close to the tactics used by con artists to prey on the trust and goodwill of their victims.This is an experiment, but corporations don’t sink millions into R&D with emotional connection as their ultimate goal.Be wary of technology that pretends to care about you. A gizmo can never “love” you back, and there is always a wizard behind the curtian (and a marketing team) pulling at those heart strings to see how much money comes out.",0.9984,0.6211538461538461,6 ,35,0

Code6,15-03-2023,"The Blink Video Doorbell is down to an all&time low of $35.Amazon has rolled out another sale on smart home devices from its Blink brand, bringing a range of video doorbells and security cameras back down to, or at least near, their lowest prices to date. If you're comfortable with the idea of having an Amazon camera outside of your home, one highlight is the Blink Video Doorbell for $35. That matches the device's all-time low, coming in $15 below Amazon's list price and about $10 off the average street price we've seen in recent months. If you're thinking of picking up a Blink cam for the first time, note that a bundle that pairs the Video Doorbell with the company's Sync Module 2 — which lets you view the camera's live feed on-demand and utilize local storage — is down to $59, which is about $15 off its usual going rate and $5 more than the best price we've tracked.Blink is essentially the budget counterpart to Amazon's other major smart home subsidiary, Ring. Its Video Doorbell is much more basic than a pricier option like Arlo's Essential Video Doorbell, the top pick from our guide to the best smart home devices, but it still delivers serviceable 1080p video, night vision and the ability to see and speak to people at your door regardless of where you are. The whole thing is relatively easy to install, and it can run off wired power or a couple of AA batteries. Blink says the device can get up to two years of juice, depending on how hard it's put into use.That said, the camera's field of view (135 degrees horizontal, 80 degrees vertical) isn't as wide as higher-end options, and it only works with Amazon's Alexa assistant, not alternative platforms like Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant or IFTTT. And while you don't need any add-ons, the doorbell's storage and live view options are limited without the Sync Module or one of Blink's subscription plans. Without the Module, you'll only receive alerts and a live view when the doorbell senses activity or someone presses its button. Still, this is a worthy option for those looking to install a competent, battery-powered doorbell cam for as little money as possible. Beyond the Video Doorbell, other notable deals include a two-camera kit of Blink's Outdoor security cam, another pick from our best smart home device guide, for $104. That's $5 more than the lowest price we've seen. The sale includes several bundles that mix and match various camera options as well.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget athttps://lnkd.in/gb2TGFmfhttps://lnkd.in/g8vW-uxH",0.9899,0.4594304388422035,0,0,0

With AI's continued growth and development, it's clear that it's going to play an even more significant role in shaping our world in the years to come.From personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous cars and drones, AI is already making a huge impact in our everyday lives. And as the technology progresses, it's going to continue to revolutionize industries like healthcare, finance, transportation, and more.One of the most exciting things about the future of AI is its potential to help us solve some of the world's most pressing challenges. From climate change to healthcare, AI has the ability to process large amounts of data and generate insights that can help us make more informed decisions.Of course, with the great potential of AI comes responsibility. It's important that we continue to have discussions around AI ethics and make sure that the development of AI is guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and fairness.As professionals, it's essential that we stay up to date with the latest developments in AI and understand how it can be applied to our respective fields. By embracing AI and continuing to learn about its capabilities, we can ensure that we are well-positioned to thrive in the new age of technology.So let's stay curious and keep exploring the exciting possibilities of AI together!#AI#future#growth#healthcare#healthcare#finance#artificialintelligence#data#ai#transportation#climatechange#developmentI#futuretech#innovation#technology#machinelearning",0.9942,0.6168446368446369,0,0,0

david mcqueen,15-03-2023,"HEALTHY AI SKEPTICISMArtificial Intelligence (AI) has shaped a way many of us navigate technology. From speech recognition to search engines.Beyond the hype of tools like ChatGTP and Dall-E, or software like Alexa and Siri, I have always been intrigued by not just the models and languages used across various forms of AI, but the ethics behind how this intelligence is created, distributed and who has the major ownership on how most of AI is rolled out and to what ends.Tech Won't Save Us has become one of the most intriguing podcasts I listen to regularly, and on the most recent episode, Dan McQuillan,  a Lecturer in Creative and Social Computing at Goldsmiths, University of London and  author of Resisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence, breaks down his own skepticism around how we embrace AI.Some good nuggets and questions that we should we be asking before we drink the cool aid of  jumping on another tech bandwagon without thinking it through.",0.9777,0.529582146248813,0,4,1 
Swapnil Amin,14-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0

And why shouldn't it? The possibilities of AI are endless and can transform the way we work and live.AI technologies have already started to change the way we create content. For example, have you heard of Descript? It's a tool that can transcribe and analyse audio and video content, making editing a breeze. And let's not forget about Canva, which uses machine learning to make personalized design recommendations and is beta-testing Magic Write in their platform. And for those of us in the video editing space, Wav2Lip generates realistic lip-syncing audio for our videos.But AI's impact doesn't stop there. Runway ML can generate or manipulate images, video, and sound using cutting-edge machine learning models.Now, I know some of you might be worried about the rise of AI and its implications for humanity. However, I want to reassure you that we're not in a Terminator 2-style takeover situation just yet. We must weigh the pros and pitfalls of this new frontier and approach it with caution.So, what do you think about the future of AI and its impact on creativity, information, and humanity as a whole? Let's keep the conversation going in the comments below! 💬#digitalmarketingagency#socialmediamanagement#youknowyourbusinessbest#marketingstrategy#oracletree#marketingforsmallbusiness#contentmarketing#buildyourbusiness#marketingadvice#chatgpt#ai#machinelearning#artificialintelligence",0.986,0.5099116161616163,0,0,0

Rudy Moenaert,10-03-2023,"THE BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMSHet leest als een who's who van ambitieuze dromen en harde landingen:- Alexa (Amazon)- Fire Phone (Amazon)- Google Glass (Alphabet)- Waymo (Alphabet)- Metaverse (Meta) (Ja hoor, plaats die ook maar in het rijtje)Ik zou kunnen zeggen - ""I told you so long ago."" Het is niet dat ik niet van innovatie hou. De ondraaglijke saaiheid van het normale trok me nooit aan. Innovatie is bovendien de focus geweest van een groot deel van mijn academische carrière. Maar simpele journalisten, egotrippers die hun naam in neon letters op Mars willen hebben, managers met een overschot aan geld en een tekort aan technisch vernuft, en een goede hypemachine voor de nieuwe technologieën dragen ertoe bij dat de samenleving telkens opnieuw vergeet dat innovatie véél trager gaat dan gedacht. Iedere degelijk wetenschappelijk onderbouwde studie van innovatie en technologische vooruitgang zal tonen dat innovatie langer duurt dan gedacht, de ontgoochelingen veel groter zijn dan geanticipeerd, en de ontnuchterende zelfreflecties veel talrijker vooraf ingeschat.De redenen zijn eenvoudig - enerzijds is de vernieuwing technologische uitdagend en anderzijds verloopt de adoptie ervan vermoeiend traag. Innovatie vereist immers gedragsverandering, en dat is iets wat het merendeel van de mensen niet echt leuk vindt. In de woorden van Lester Thurow - ""Sociology always beats technology, but eventually sociology changes."" Dat het veranderen van die 'sociologie' zeer traag gebeurt, vergeet men al te vaak.  In de woorden van Paul Ormerod - ""Most experiments fail."" Bon, hoe waar dit ook is, met dergelijk fatalisme komen we ook niet bij een betere wereld, natuurlijk. It spoils the fun big time.Het is natuurlijk ambigu - het zijn de gekke projecten die de wereld vooruitbranden. En dus moeten we af en toe geloven dat die radicale innovatie zal lukken. Maar dat is precies de essentie van 'geloof' - meegaan in een gedachtegoed zonder dat er empirisch bewijs is dat het écht goed komt. De Ongelovige Thomas is een rolmodel dat iets meer mag worden gewaardeerd in de huidige techgekte. Eind januari tankte ik mijn Q5 (diesel) vol in Kitzbühel, en ik reed zonder bijtanken 1000 km huiswaarts. Zal mijn volgende wagen elektrisch zal zijn? Geloof ik dat er snel een elektrische wagen zal zijn van pakweg €45.000, die er niet belachelijk uitziet, en die écht een actieradius van >800km heeft?

Kornel Grunwald,15-03-2023,"That is an interesting one: 'In an interview with the Financial Times, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella labelled the first generation of voice assistants “dumb as a rock”, including Cortana and Siri from Apple and Alexa and Google Assistant from Google. When asked about voice assistants in 2016, Nadella reportedly said “Bots are the new apps”.'I can follow the logic that the promise of voice bots fell short of expectations and how GPT-related innovation is finally realizing a portion of that potential. But the big gap is still missing. And it was not about 'dumbness' that made bots really annoying.A few years ago, voicebots took centre stage with the promise of revolutionizing customer service and user experience. However, their limited understanding of natural language, context, and complexity made them less effective than anticipated. Users often found themselves frustrated with their interactions, leading to a decline in their adoption. I have heard also how difficult it was for these companies to deal with local dialects and small language fluctuations, and do the proper job to annotate datasets with such voice samples.Then GPT enters the stage. Here are two of the ways in which GPT-powered solutions have outshined voicebots:1. Enhanced natural language understanding: GPT-based models can comprehend context and nuance.2. High-quality generation: GPT-powered AI can create human-like responses.Voicebots may not have lived up to their initial hype, but GPT-related innovation has stepped in to fill that void. But does it really?We still are to see a proper missing link to be provided by new innovation: understanding of our voices.How do understand the human voice, if we just continue to speak as we do - I am not sure if you realize how unusual our patterns of speaking are. But beyond that, how tech can listen to those who struggle with some voice-related disabilities or impairments? Or how to get around the 'weirdness' of non-native speakers being fluent in the new language?These are, by far, not trivial or simple tasks, and as much as I can see the GPT revolution giving us better chances at providing great experience once voice is transcribed into text, it is still far from breaking that frontier and making our voice the main interface with technology.But considering the fact that I personally know a couple of specialists in ML/AI looking into this specific problem, I bet we are in for something big soon.Interesting times.#voice#ai",0.9621,0.3966063069721607,1 ,2,0

Alexander Steiner,15-03-2023,"𝗥𝗣𝗔 𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲! ❌Seit Jahrzehnten bekommen wir das Versprechen, dass wir Befehle nicht mehr als Code eingeben müssen.Hierfür gab es schon die unterschiedlichsten Ansätze, die natürlich über die Zeit hin immer besser und ausgefeilter wurden.  🙌Alternativen für die Command Line sollen nach dem Willen der Entwickler unter anderem sein:🔹 Die grafische Benutzeroberfläche (GUI), die durch Icons, Buttons und Menüs die Interaktion mit dem Computer erleichtert und weniger technisches Wissen erfordert als die Command Line.🔹 Die ""Natural Language Interfaces"", die es ermöglichen, den Computer in natürlicher Sprache zu steuern, ähnlich wie man mit einem menschlichen Gesprächspartner sprechen würde.🔹 Und nicht zu vergessen Sprachassistenten wie Siri, Google Assistant und Alexa. Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt. Letztendlich ist es nur ein Werkzeug, keine Philosophie oder Wissenschaft.Was ist Deine Meinung dazu? ✍#rpa#digitalisierung#automatisierung#prozessautomation#mittelstand",-0.9945,0.35,2 ,4,0

Letícia Tainara Souza,15-03-2023,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, histórico de tendências e evoluções, aqui vão algumas das tendências de marketing para 2023:🤳🏻 Marketing de influência: o marketing de influência chegou pra ficar e continuará a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conteúdo para alcançar públicos específicos (Ó a base da Virginia aí, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).🎁 Personalização: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experiência personalizada e relevante, e as empresas estão investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estratégias para atender a essa demanda.📼 Vídeo marketing: o vídeo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produção de vídeo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Então investe nisso. A era dos estáticos morreu).🔊 Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas estão começando a adotar estratégias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personalização também).📩 Marketing de conteúdo: este continuará a desempenhando um papel importante na construção de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom! Se você é um profissional da área, sugiro começar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estratégias e tomadas de decisão. Pois como diz a famosa música de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por aí, ""hoje é um novo dia, de um novo tempo que começou. Todos os nossos sonhos, serão verdade e o futuro já começou"".#marketing#tecnologia#amazon#empresas#salesforce#marketingsensorial#marketing2023#marketingderelacionamento",-0.3956,1.0,3 ,6,0
