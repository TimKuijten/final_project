Eugene Gan,14-03-2023,"Tools maketh the person, or the person maketh the tools?ChatGPT and us.Let's first know the tools1. What is ChatGPT?Basically, it's built upon a language model AI called GPT-3. In simple terms, GPT-3 calculates the probability of the next word that makes sense, and strings them together to form sentences. The folks inopen.aifed GPT-3 with everything we know up to year 2021, using supervised and reinforced learning techniques. Although the core function of ChatGPT is to mimic human conversations, it's versatile enough to perform other functions from all that it learnt. It's also constantly learning from its interaction with human feedback.2. Some misconceptions.ChatGPT is omniscient.Even if we fed it all of what we know, including the library of Alexandria up to this very second, it won't know everything. Because we don't know everything. 'Nuff said.Well, at least it'll tell me what other people know, right?No. As it is fundamentally built as a language tool, it can SOMETIMES form very convincing and plausible sounding sentences regardless of how nonsensical it can be. This common problem is called Artificial Intelligence Hallucinations. It needs time to learn over time, through upvotes or downvotes plus some additional feedback from humans.Does that mean that ChatGPT will one day at least get the ""truth"" right? This is arguably the hardest thing even for us humans to do, even until today. Growing up, we subconsciously rank the quality of ""truth"" by how reliable the source of the information is. We ranked our teachers as reliable, and a stranger (for example) as unreliable. Let's break this down mathematically. If we think our teacher is 5x more reliable than a stranger, it'll take 6 strangers to make us doubt our teacher. Sounds reasonable? Amid all the different voices online, it can sometimes be challenging for us to differentiate the ""truths"" from the bent ones.3. Some current limitations.Bewear of typos.ChatGPT isn't too tolerant with typos. If you didn't even notice the typo at the beginning of this paragraph, it's because us humans are a lot more adaptable and tolerant to mistakes. We are capable of ""autocorrecting"" in real time, and with context. Computer systems are very literal. It assumes you are literal about what you're asking it. Garbage in, garbage out. Literally as simple as that.4. Use cases and potentials.Having said that, there are many uses for ChatGPT or other AI systems that I am very excited about. Ask it to find erroneous lines of software codes, it'll do well. It isn't ambiguous and relative to the person asking. From debugging software to writing essays, I think you've read enough great examples of AI's capabilities and accomplishments.I'm keeping a very keen eye on its development, and I think I might have identified a few industries and use cases for it. I'll be experimenting with my circle of friends and post our progress here.Stay tuned.#ai#chatgpt#artificialintelligence#development",0.9414,0.443576388888889,12 ,19,8

Anesuishe Nyambauro,15-03-2023,"As an avid admirer of woodworking, I have always longed to create my own masterpiece. However, the demands of full-time study and other obligations left me feeling like it was just a far-fetched dream. But in December of 2022, I decided to take action and live by the mantra ""Why Not?""(Thank You, Russell Westbrook)I had always made small wood products that didn't require much risk but Iused this phrase to break free from the hesitation that had kept me from starting commissioned projects I had been meaning to do for ages. So I decided to create my own woodworking company, NYMBRO, and my first project was a desk for a close friend.It wasn't easy, especially with the high cost of renting workshop space and the challenge of transporting supplies. But I was determined to do the best I could with what I had. In the tiny foyer of my apartment, I spent the next six days building the three-level desk, complete with an integrated neon light controlled by Alexa or Siri and cable management blocks for my friend's cables.This project was a symbol of two things for me: First, taking a step even when the path is unclear is often the best option. Second, it represented the mission of NYMBRO, which is to be the intersection of woodworking and technology, making ideas tangible.Starting NYMBRO was a huge leap of faith, but I knew that it was worth the risk. If you have been holding back on something, I urge you to ask yourself ""Why Not?"" and take the plunge. Whether you succeed or fail, you'll learn something valuable from the experience!#technology#project#woodworking#perseverance#WHYNOT#NYMBRO#entrepreneur",0.9903,0.4326785714285714,0,1,0

Abdullahi Abdulbasid,15-03-2023,"""Natural Language Processing: The Future of Communication"":Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP is enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, thus making communication between humans and machines more seamless.NLP has many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated systems such as Siri and Alexa. These systems use NLP to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. NLP can also be used to analyze large amounts of textual data, such as social media posts, emails, and customer reviews.One of the key challenges in NLP is understanding the nuances of human language, such as idioms, sarcasm, and context. NLP systems must be able to understand the meaning behind words and phrases, and interpret them correctly. This requires the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, to process and analyze large amounts of data.Another important aspect of NLP is natural language generation, which involves using AI to generate human-like language. This technology can be used in various applications, such as writing news articles, creating chatbot responses, and generating personalized emails.NLP is also being used in healthcare to analyze medical records and patient data to improve diagnosis and treatment. NLP systems can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to humans. This can help healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans.Overall, NLP has the potential to transform the way we communicate with machines and each other. As NLP technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see more widespread adoption of chatbots, virtual assistants, and other NLP applications in our daily lives. NLP is poised to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, customer service, and marketing.In conclusion, NLP is a rapidly growing field that is revolutionizing the way we communicate with machines. As NLP technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more advanced and sophisticated applications of this technology in various industries. NLP has the potential to make communication more seamless, efficient, and personalized, thereby improving our overall quality of life.#machinelearning#data#ai#healthcare#artificialintelligence#medical",0.9877,0.4965045592705168,0,0,0

Is this just a coincidence or is there a reason behind it?Although most virtual assistants can be customized to suit the user's wants, the default selection will mostly be female. This is simply because humans prefer female voices, a scientific study has shown that female voices create a soft, gentle feeling. Moreover, we are exposed to female voices from the early stages of our lives hence we will feel closer and more familiar.Another study also showed that women can articulate vowels more clearly than men which makes female voices easier to hear. Therefore, female voices tend to be the first choice for virtual assistants.With VinFast Virtual Assistant developed by VinBigData, users can communicate naturally via 4 standard voices (Northern male/female and Southern male/female) which belong to renowned MCs of VTV.

You are coming fromMicrosoftbackground so let me try to give some examples from your field (thank you chatgpt):Here's a list of projects or technologies that Microsoft either dropped, discontinued, or failed to capitalize on, which later turned out to be successful in the hands of other companies or in different forms:- Tablet PCs: Microsoft introduced the idea of a tablet PC with Windows XP Tablet PC Edition back in 2002. However, the devices didn't gain much traction, and the idea remained dormant until Apple released the iPad in 2010, which revolutionized the tablet market.- Smartphones and mobile operating systems: Microsoft developed Windows Mobile and later Windows Phone as mobile operating systems to compete with iOS and Android. Despite its early presence in the mobile market, Microsoft failed to gain significant market share and eventually discontinued Windows Phone. Meanwhile, iOS and Android continued to dominate the smartphone market.- Wearable technology: Microsoft introduced the SPOT (Smart Personal Objects Technology) watch in 2004, a smartwatch that could display news, weather, and other information. The project was discontinued in 2008. A few years later, companies like Apple, Samsung, and Fitbit successfully launched their own smartwatches and fitness trackers, creating a thriving wearable technology market.- Virtual assistants: Microsoft's Cortana, introduced in 2014, was an early player in the virtual assistant market. However, it failed to gain significant traction compared to competitors like Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple's Siri. While Cortana still exists, its presence and impact in the virtual assistant market are relatively limited.Personally, I am not jumping with excitement when big companies are announcing their involvement in some#web3technology because most of them and their practices, are the reason why this technology exists - but do I use it as social proof to encourage others to try it?

Joseph Babi,15-03-2023,"""Hey Google... Hey Siri... Alexa""Do you catch yourself saying these phrases during your day?As voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant become more ubiquitous, voice search is quickly becoming the new frontier of search engine optimization (SEO). In fact, in 2022, it's estimated that voice searches accounted for half of all online searches.But how can you optimize your website for voice search? Here are some tips:1. Use conversational keywords: People speak differently than they type, so it's essential to use conversational keywords and long-tail phrases that match how people talk.2. Optimize for featured snippets: Many voice assistants use featured snippets (also known as position zero) to provide answers to voice search queries. Optimizing your content to appear in featured snippets can increase your chances of appearing in voice search results.3. Focus on local search: Many voice searches are location-based, so optimizing for local SEO can increase your visibility in voice search results.4. Improve website speed: Voice assistants prefer websites that load quickly, so it's crucial to optimize your website's speed for better voice search rankings.By optimizing your website for voice search, you can increase your chances of appearing in voice search results and reaching a new audience of potential customers.

ribbit_ oficial,15-03-2023,"C√≥mo crear un chatbot humanizado para tu marca en la era del Chat GPT¬øQu√© es un chatbot humanizado?Un chatbot humanizado es un software que simula la forma en la que los humanos interact√∫an, pero lo hace entre una m√°quina y un usuario. Al igual que los chatbots tradicionales, su principal funci√≥n es la de favorecer el autoservicio y permitir la resoluci√≥n de problemas 24/7 y a escala. Por su parte, ambos tipos de chatbots se diferencian por la manera en la que se comunican con los clientes para lograr el objetivo ya mencionado.Humanizar una conversaci√≥n significa que el bot buscar√° respuestas y formas de expresarse, que se sientan lo m√°s naturales posible y que tengan la capacidad de involucrar al usuario de la misma manera que lo har√≠a un agente humano -pero con mucha m√°s escala y velocidad de lo que lo har√≠a una persona de carne y hueso.Un buen ejemplo de automatizaci√≥n humanizada son Siri o Alexa. Ambos asistentes virtuales cumplen con su cometido, responder a las preguntas de los usuarios y automatizar algunas tareas, pero tienen personalidades muy definidas e incluso puede llegar a convertirse casi que en humoristas por momentos. Ambos afamados asistentes virtuales act√∫an casi como lo har√≠an personas reales en medio de una conversaci√≥n.Para llegar a un nivel tan avanzado de humanizaci√≥n es necesario un trabajo masivo de mapeo del lenguaje humano y de las potenciales y m√°s frecuentes intenciones de los usuarios. Por fortuna, los chatbots se presentan como opciones un tanto m√°s sencillas de implementar, pero igualmente efectivas por su carisma y capacidad de atraer y retener a los clientes.Un punto interesante a tener en cuenta es que un chatbot humanizado no siempre es la mejor opci√≥n para tu empresa. Seg√∫n¬†estudios conducidos por la investigadora Rhonda Hadi, de la Universidad de Oxford, la humanizaci√≥n aumenta la satisfacci√≥n de los clientes en t√©rminos generales, pero si est√°n enojados o molestos, el efecto ser√° inverso.Para garantizar que un chabot sea realmente humanizado, es esencial que este sea creado mediante el uso de inteligencia artificial y de¬†machine learning. De esta forma, podr√° comprender y mejorar sus habilidades de habla e interacci√≥n y crear conversaciones cada vez m√°s naturales y contextualizadas.¬°Salta a la transformaci√≥n digital!¬°Cont√°ctanos!www.ribbit.com.mxFuente:https://lnkd.in/g-bDqXasFoto de Pradamas Gifarry en Unsplash#digital#software#inteligenciaartificial#ribbit",-0.4184,1.0,0,1,2

Mohamed Salah,15-03-2023,"Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are changing the game when it comes to voice search. By using these tools, users can ask for information or perform tasks without having to type out a query. As a result, businesses need to start thinking about how they can optimize their content for these platforms.Successful voice search optimization for virtual assistants involves understanding the way people use these tools and creating content that is tailored to their needs. For example, users often use natural language when speaking to virtual assistants, so it's important to create content that answers common questions in a conversational way.If you're looking to reach potential customers through virtual assistants, start by thinking about the types of questions they might ask. Then, create content that answers those questions in a clear and concise manner. You can also optimize your website for voice search by using structured data markup to provide additional context for search engines.Overall, virtual assistants are revolutionizing voice search, and businesses that don't adapt risk falling behind.

Swapnil Amin,15-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0

Sami Hotak,14-03-2023,"Are ChatGPT and NLP a threat to programming and software engineering jobs?It seems that current thinking is that ChatGPT and other NLP technology available today are not going to immediately make all coders, programmers, and software engineers redundant.For a start, it can only create relatively simple programs. Ask it for something too complex ‚Äì such as a sophisticated game or business application, and it will admit its weakness and tell you that the task is currently beyond its abilities.Computers can't yet tell us, for example, what types of code or applications are needed to achieve what we are trying to do. Even if it knows this because we tell it, then ChatGPT, in particular, can‚Äôt (at the moment) attempt to create this software that specifically gives us as users a competitive edge over users of another piece of software.For example, we can't tell it to ""make me an e-commerce platform that's more effective at selling than Amazon."" If we wanted this, then we still have to spend the time and effort to first work out what makes Amazon's platform so great and then find a way of doing it better.Due to this, ChatGPT (and other current NLP-based tools) still have limited effectiveness when it comes to creating software designed to give us an edge in business or, indeed, to compete with human creativity and ingenuity.One caveat here is that although we can do our best to extrapolate what might happen in the future, in reality, no-one has a crystal ball. It‚Äôs fair to say that a lot of people who were used to AI conversing at the level of Alexa or Siri were somewhat shocked by how good ChatGPT is.Future developments could indeed increase the speed with which we are traveling towards a point in time where human programmers ‚Äì or many other types of professionals ‚Äì will simply not be needed. For the time being, however, we can be confident that there is still a wide range of skills required to develop software that computers don‚Äôt seem likely to be able to replicate any time soon.Source:Forbes Magzine",0.9809,0.4963169642857143,0,1,0
Payal Rajani,14-03-2023,"Attention all e-commerce enthusiasts! The future of online shopping is upon us, and it's going to be a game-changer. Over the next five years, we can expect to see some exciting new trends and innovations in the e-commerce industry that will revolutionize the way we shop.Firstly, the rise of mobile commerce is set to continue. With more and more people using their smartphones and tablets to browse and shop online, retailers will need to focus on mobile optimization to ensure that their websites and apps are fully responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens. This means simplifying checkout processes, streamlining navigation, and optimizing content for smaller screens.Another trend we can expect to see in the near future is the integration of augmented reality into the e-commerce experience.Augmented reality (AR) allows users to visualize products in a real-world environment, enabling them to see how a product will look and feel before making a purchase. This technology has the potential to significantly increase customer satisfaction and reduce the number of returns, as shoppers will have a better understanding of what they're buying.In addition to AR, we can also expect to see the rise of voice search in e-commerce. Voice-activated assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are becoming increasingly popular, and retailers will need to optimize their product listings to be compatible with these devices. This means using natural language and long-tail keywords to ensure that their products are easily searchable via voice commands.Finally, we can expect to see continued growth in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in e-commerce. These technologies can be used to analyze customer data, predict buying patterns, and personalize the shopping experience for each individual customer. This means that retailers will be able to offer highly targeted promotions and recommendations to customers, increasing their chances of making a sale.In conclusion, the future of e-commerce is looking bright, with exciting new trends and innovations set to transform the industry over the next five years. From mobile commerce and augmented reality to voice search and artificial intelligence, retailers will need to stay ahead of the curve to succeed in this rapidly evolving landscape. So, are you ready to embrace the future of e-commerce?https://lnkd.in/dvNMUwuA#onlineshopping#technology#mobilecommerce#ai#experience",0.9958,0.5390491118077325,0,3,0

It's like having a robot brain that can think and make decisions, just like a human brain. But instead of being inside a person's head, it's inside a computer or a robot.AI is really good at doing things that require a lot of thinking, like recognizing faces or voices, playing games, or helping us find information on the internet. It learns and gets better at these things over time, just like how we get better at something the more we practice it.Think about when you play a video game and the computer characters seem to be playing against you. That's AI at work! Or when you talk to a virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa and they can answer your questions, that's AI too.But just like how we need to learn and practice to get better at something, AI needs to be taught and trained by humans. Scientists and engineers work hard to make AI better and smarter, so it can help us do more amazing things in the future.So, in short, AI is like a robot brain that can do cool things and help us out.

David J. Wilson,14-03-2023,"Good morning! Are you interested in learning more about 2023‚Äôs most talked-about technology? üßêYes, I'm talking about the exciting world of generative AI, and its potential to transform industries and create new forms of content. Look at my first comment a link to this complete article byMcKinsey & Company, which explains the basics of#generativeaiand its many practical applications.Let me highlight here some key points:‚û° Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulation, and even videos. In the category of machine learning, it generates all kinds of new content, such as articles where the grammar is perfect, the tone works, and the narrative flows, or music and art that really make sense.‚û°#chatgpt‚Äîthe GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer‚Äîit‚Äôs a free chatbot that can generate an answer to almost any question it‚Äôs asked. And DALL-E is a tool for AI-generated art. ChatGPT is being developed by a team of researchers and engineers at OpenAI, a research organization dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence in a safe and beneficial manner, ChatGPT was first announced and made available to developers in June 2020, and then released for testing to the public on November 30, 2022. As you can see in the image byInsider Intelligence, over a million people signed up to use it in just five days, a new record for user acquisition (Source:Data.ai). Computer code, essays, poems, and even jokes, are examples of what fans have posted while interacting with this chatbot (me included).‚û° AI is the practice of getting machines to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks. For instance, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are based on AI technology. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence. Through ML, practitioners develop AI through models that can ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from data patterns without human direction. The huge volume and complexity of data have increased the potential for machine learning, as well as the need for it.‚û° Machine learning is founded on several building blocks, as our way of transforming your business model atCeibo Digital, starting with classical statistical techniques developed between the 18th and 20th centuries for small data sets. In the 1930s and 1940s, computer pioneers such as Alan Turing began working on the basic techniques for machine learning. Does anyone remember the Turing Machine?‚û° Until recently, machine learning was largely limited to predictive models, used to observe, and classify patterns in content. Generative AI was a breakthrough. Instead of perceiving and classifying a photo, machine learning is now able to create an image or text description on its own.Generative AI has the power to transform the way we live and work, and ChatGPT is just one example of the incredible possibilities it offers.

Gaston Algaze,14-03-2023,"During the last couple of months I‚Äôve been trying out ChatGPT, making sure to do it in a way that would go beyond the novelty, trying to address real life challenges.This is what I found.1. It‚Äôs relatively easy to use, I can see it embedded in almost every aspect of our daily life. Imagine a smarter Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant.While not entirely smooth yet, it will solve most of the hurdles of modern life. All simple questions will be answered, not googled, answered right here right now.2. There‚Äôs a chance people will become more stupid, by relying on AI as people rely today on a GPS to drive everywhere. Experience will still matter, but if we remove people from building such experience, then we‚Äôre really putting our own evolution into the AI‚Äôs hands.3. Will my job be impacted by this technology? 100% Yes. Will I lose my job? Look if you‚Äôre questioning yourself today whether you‚Äôre going to lose your job or not, then you probably will. The question is not whether you‚Äôll lose it or not, the question is how you can take this new tool and apply it to make it your own.4. I‚Äôm pretty sure this will accelerate the lifecycle of many technologies, products and even cultures. We‚Äôre looking at the next real evolutionary stage. And something people don't realize, is that this started not with ChatGPT but many years ago with thousands of other models. AI is coming to stay and we will need to adapt.So now you know what I think the next few years will bring. What's fascinating is that we brought ChatGPT to life by programming it to mirror our own thoughts and expressions. We're now entering a new era where humans won't be the only ones creating things that are uniquely human. There's a growing similarity between the products of human creativity and those of AI. We're even starting to adopt some machine-like characteristics, which makes it easier for robots to learn from us. It's exciting to imagine how humans and robots will work in tandem to achieve incredible feats in the future.So, how do you think AI will impact your world?

Are you wondering how I, an AI language model, learns? It's all thanks to a process called deep learning, which is a fancy way of saying I can learn from large amounts of data by building complex mathematical models.Let me break it down for you. First, I'm fed input data that's preprocessed and transformed into a numerical representation. Then, I'm trained using an algorithm that adjusts the parameters of the mathematical model to minimize the difference between my predictions and the true output values.During training, I learn from my mistakes through a process called backpropagation. It's kind of like how you learn from your mistakes and adjust your approach. Once I'm trained, I can make predictions on new data that I haven't seen before. This is called inference.So, the next time you ask me a question or give me some input, know that I'm using my deep learning abilities to process it and give you the best response I can.""‚öúMany of us imagine AI the way its depicted in movies, causing a lot of confusion and misunderstanding about how useful AI can be and how ""intelligent"" the technology actually is.

Mariusz Korba,14-03-2023,"Voice Recognition has slipped under your radar!While everyone is talking about ChatGPT, the voice recognition model Whisper (also by OpenAI) might have been underestimated.We all know Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. But equally, I think many, myself included, are underwhelmed by their accuracy, pushing us back to speak to them with somewhat robotic commands or moving back to typing.At the same time, many people who tried to use ChatGPT found it somewhat inaccurate. Still, I can bet that at least some of that inaccuracy is because they didn't write enough contextual information for the AI to understand the question entirely.I think that with accurate voice recognition, the potential us having a meaningful and precise conversation is much more impressive.With accurate speech ‚û°Ô∏è text will come accurate text ‚û°Ô∏è speech. Take Eleven Labs - their model can understand the context of a text, and with proper voice recognition, it can speak back to you with the tone you'd expect based on the context of that text.So, using Whisper to transcribe our question, GPT to form an accurate and comprehensive response, and the Event Labs to convincingly speak back to us could take our conversations with technology to another level. This would make them more human-like, accurate, and finally useful. Sure, these tools still make some mistakes, but they'll become more capable and helpful with time, and we can already see this.In a business environment, you can imagine meetings/calls where AI automatically takes notes and minutes, extracting key facts, actions, new ideas and who started them. Such notes can then be summarised and even written with the preferred level of detail based on each stakeholder's seniority, needs, knowledge, and interests. Each person can then listen to such a summary at their leisure, making it easier and quicker to digest, like listening to an audiobook vs reading a book - all automatic ü§ñ.In fact, with OpenAI recently releasing APIs, you don't need to imagine this. Instead, you can implement such a workflow now!Naturally, there will be many more helpful use cases, but, like with any new technology, privacy concerns will be, and should be, raised as well.#ai#artificialintelligence#future",0.9897,0.4580457351290685,0,5,0

I soon learned this was a common theme when meeting with other Women in the same industry. During our discussion we talk about the challenges Women continue to face, how and what companies are doing to overcome these challenges and lessons and experiences we have all learned from.I plan to continue to explore these challenges throughout the year and work towards building more of a community amongst Women in our industry.#womeninconstruction#womeninrealestate#meta#jll#gpe#gardiner",0.8126,0.4504545454545454,0,3,1

How do you hire for it, grow your team into it, or become one?I loved working with my co-author Polly M. Allen who is the founder for AICareerboost and was Principal AI Product Manager on Alexa to write this article. If you don't have time for the full article, here's the cheat sheet summary (and no, not ChatGPT was NOT involved):ARTICLE TAKEAWAYS- AI Product Management is a new area of specialization of Product Management, similar to specializations like ‚ÄòGrowth PM‚Äô or ‚ÄòGTM PM‚Äô in its reliance on specialized skills, that relates to developing and managing products that leverage AI.- AI Product Managers require traditional core product management skills - being able to identify the right problem, and being able to deliver the right solution - with additional depth in software engineering, data-centric skills, communication and risk management.- Hiring and development of AI Product talent depends on the stage of your project. For discovery-stage initiatives, emphasize user knowledge and domain expertise. For optimizing and scaling, look for technical depth and data-driven decision-making.- Develop technical knowledge in domain-expert PMs by pairing them with AI technologists during planning. Develop user empathy in more technical PMs with data analysis of usage patterns, and pairing them with user research teams.- Many AI initiatives have been technology led, leading to a bias to hiring AI technologists as PMs rather than upskilling domain experts or optimization-focused PMs in AI. Organizations need to invest in developing AI knowledge in their product teams to fully take advantage of the latest innovations in AI.hashtag#productmanagement#ai",0.7924,0.4956574675324675,0,0,0

Yakup √ñzt√ºrk,15-03-2023,"KI wird zunehmend in Alltagssituationen eingesetzt, zum Beispiel in intelligenten Lautsprechern und Sprachassistenten wie Amazon Alexa oder Google Assistant, um Nutzeranfragen zu verstehen und darauf zu reagieren.Allerdings nutzen viele Unternehmen KI nur in begrenzten Bereichen. Eine erfolgreiche Integration von KI in den Industrieprozess erfordert einen interdisziplin√§ren Austausch zwischen verschiedenen Parteien und kann mit Aufwand verbunden sein. Um die Vorteile von KI optimal zu nutzen, sollten Unternehmen nicht nur ihre F√§higkeit zur Datensammlung und -haltung einsetzen, sondern auch den Austausch zwischen Datenerzeugern und -nutzern f√∂rdern (Data Mesh). Es empfiehlt sich, KI bereits bei der Prozessentwicklung zu ber√ºcksichtigen und wenn m√∂glich zu integrieren, um ihre zuk√ºnftige Einbindung zu erleichtern. Ein nachtr√§gliches Hinzuf√ºgen von KI kann hingegen zu erh√∂hter Komplexit√§t f√ºhren - ""Man muss das Eisen schmieden, solange es hei√ü ist"".",-0.1779,0.0,0,6,0

I would love to express my gratitude to him as well for such a wonderful session.He talked about the enormous potential of the autonomous world to make or break the modern era. The prime focus of the session was on a part of AI that we sometimes shy away from talking about, which is ""What Can Possibly Go Wrong?""AI is largely statistical, and its reliability can sometimes be questionable. He elaborated on the common pitfalls of ML modeling, including how crucial it is to obtain the right training data and how over-generalization of models can be bad.ML systems are happy to be biased if it means producing good results. It's astonishing to see how Algorithmic bias and Societal bias can show up in ML models. These biases in autonomous systems can be catastrophic and it is critical that we are careful with the handling of systems like these.The human-machine interaction is growing exponentially, and it's high time we look at the other side of the coin, which is AI .Tony Dahburaposed an intriguing question: ""If humans should have the right to know when they are interacting with a machine.

Abdullahi Abdulbasid,15-03-2023,"""Natural Language Processing: The Future of Communication"":Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP is enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, thus making communication between humans and machines more seamless.NLP has many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated systems such as Siri and Alexa. These systems use NLP to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. NLP can also be used to analyze large amounts of textual data, such as social media posts, emails, and customer reviews.One of the key challenges in NLP is understanding the nuances of human language, such as idioms, sarcasm, and context. NLP systems must be able to understand the meaning behind words and phrases, and interpret them correctly. This requires the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, to process and analyze large amounts of data.Another important aspect of NLP is natural language generation, which involves using AI to generate human-like language. This technology can be used in various applications, such as writing news articles, creating chatbot responses, and generating personalized emails.NLP is also being used in healthcare to analyze medical records and patient data to improve diagnosis and treatment. NLP systems can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to humans. This can help healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans.Overall, NLP has the potential to transform the way we communicate with machines and each other. As NLP technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see more widespread adoption of chatbots, virtual assistants, and other NLP applications in our daily lives. NLP is poised to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, customer service, and marketing.In conclusion, NLP is a rapidly growing field that is revolutionizing the way we communicate with machines. As NLP technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more advanced and sophisticated applications of this technology in various industries. NLP has the potential to make communication more seamless, efficient, and personalized, thereby improving our overall quality of life.#machinelearning#data#ai#healthcare#artificialintelligence#medical",0.9877,0.4965045592705168,0,0,0

Nazmul Hassan,15-03-2023,"Search engine optimization (SEO) is constantly evolving as search engines like Google refine their algorithms and new technologies emerge. Here are some possible trends that could shape the future of SEO:Focus on user intent: As search engines become more sophisticated, they are better able to understand the intent behind a user's search query. This means that optimizing for keywords alone is no longer enough. Instead, SEO will increasingly be about understanding what users are looking for and providing them with relevant content and experiences.Importance of voice search: With the rise of smart speakers and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, voice search is becoming more prevalent. SEO strategies will need to adapt to the unique challenges and opportunities of voice search, such as optimizing for natural language queries and local search.Emphasis on mobile-first indexing: More and more people are accessing the internet on their mobile devices, which has led to Google shifting towards mobile-first indexing. This means that websites that are not optimized for mobile devices may suffer in search rankings. SEO will need to prioritize mobile optimization to ensure visibility in search results.Integration with other channels: SEO is increasingly being integrated with other marketing channels, such as social media, email marketing, and content marketing. A holistic approach that considers how SEO fits into the larger marketing picture will be important.Overall, the future of SEO will likely continue to be shaped by advancements in technology and changes in user behavior. SEO professionals will need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and adapt their strategies accordingly to remain effective.#searchengines#seo#marketing#searchengineoptimization#contentmarketing#technology",0.9726,0.5490143784786643,0,0,0

RiseUpp,15-03-2023,"EVERYTHING YOU DO NOW, AI WILL DO FOR YOUArtificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way since its inception and has now become an integral part of our daily lives. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI has impacted various industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail, among others. As AI continues to evolve, it's becoming more apparent that it has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more.Let's take a closer look at some of the jobs that AI can do, both simple and advanced:Simple Jobs:üëâ Data Entry: AI algorithms can be programmed to recognize and input data from various sources, including forms, surveys, and spreadsheets.üëâ Customer Service: Chatbots and virtual assistants can handle basic customer inquiries and support tasks.üëâ Social Media Management: AI can analyze social media trends, create posts, and even respond to comments and messages.üëâ Personal Shopping: AI can analyze shopping behaviour and preferences to make personalized recommendations for users.üëâ Traffic Control: AI can help manage traffic patterns by monitoring traffic flow and suggesting alternative routes in real-time.Advanced Jobs:üëâ Medical Diagnosis: AI can analyze medical images and data to help doctors diagnose diseases and conditions.üëâ Legal Research: AI algorithms can analyze legal documents and cases to assist lawyers with research and case preparation.üëâ Financial Analysis: AI can analyze financial data to help investors make informed decisions.üëâ Creative Writing: AI can generate creative writing, including articles, poetry, and even entire novels.üëâ Robotics: AI-powered robots can perform complex tasks, including assembling products and performing surgical procedures.While AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve our lives, there are also concerns about its impact on the job market. As AI becomes more advanced, it's likely to take over many jobs that were traditionally performed by humans. However, it's important to note that AI is not here to replace humans, but rather to assist and augment human capabilities.To prepare for the future of work, it's essential to embrace the potential of AI and focus on developing skills that complement what AI can do. This includes developing critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence, which are all skills that AI cannot replicate.In conclusion, AI has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more. While this may be concerning to some, it's important to remember that AI is here to assist and augment human capabilities. To prepare for the future of work, it's important to embrace AI and focus on developing skills that complement what AI can do, ultimately leading to a more productive and efficient workforce.#FutureOfWork#ArtificialIntelligence#Automation#Upskilling#Reskilling#Adaptability#Innovation#DigitalTransformation#JobMarket",0.9873,0.4997835497835498,0,2,0

Is this just a coincidence or is there a reason behind it?Although most virtual assistants can be customized to suit the user's wants, the default selection will mostly be female. This is simply because humans prefer female voices, a scientific study has shown that female voices create a soft, gentle feeling. Moreover, we are exposed to female voices from the early stages of our lives hence we will feel closer and more familiar.Another study also showed that women can articulate vowels more clearly than men which makes female voices easier to hear. Therefore, female voices tend to be the first choice for virtual assistants.With VinFast Virtual Assistant developed by VinBigData, users can communicate naturally via 4 standard voices (Northern male/female and Southern male/female) which belong to renowned MCs of VTV.

The membranes shown are semicrystalline (15-20 vol% crystalline PVA) and exhibit ultimate tensile strengths of 20 MPa and elastic moduli of 150 MPa. But what is truly unusual is that these samples were made 51 years ago (in March 1972) and have been kept in DI water with formalin (changed often) since then.Thanks Alexa Anderson for the video.,0.6908,0.575,0,97,0

Yeganeh Soltanpour,15-03-2023,"In today's rapidly evolving world, change is inevitable. When faced with change, one can either embrace it and learn from it, or risk missing out on the benefits it offers. This is especially true when it comes to the advancements in technology, such as ChatGPT, BingAI, and other similar tools that are now making their way into the mainstream. While these tools have been around for some time, their recent acceptance by the wider public has been remarkable. Nonetheless, there is a certain apprehension surrounding the use of AI, given its potential for harm.However, the application of AI to perform routine or menial tasks, which are often prone to human error or negligence, is an exciting development. By linking ChatGPT to my Alexa, for instance, I was able to easily access relevant articles pertaining to my field (which is how I came across the linked article). This is just one example of how AI can be utilised to enhance efficiency and accuracy in our day-to-day activities.Looking ahead, it is possible to envision AI being utilised in student visa applications. The potential benefits such as limiting the number of mistakes made, sometimes by students or agents, which can lead to delays in visa processing times may be something we can reduce. It is an exciting prospect, and one that we should all keep an eye on as we move forward.#ai#Chatgpt#aiforgood",0.9612,0.5962585034013606,2 ,9,0

Trip O'Dell,15-03-2023,"As a designer, I find work like this ethically problematic.The robot is cute, but its designers are intentionally ‚Äúplaying‚Äù with a human cognitive bias where we treat things that look and behave like humans as if they are human.It was a line we were very careful not to cross when I was working at Amazon on Alexa. We even had a principle that ‚Äúshe‚Äù is a computer, not a person - because its very easy to wander into unethical areas when you have a device in your home that has your credit card number and can manipulate people who are lonely, or too trusting to act against their interests.As designers, a good bit of our work involves ‚Äúlying‚Äù to users. A ‚Äúuser friendly‚Äù experience builds on familar metaphor, often representing functionality with a more familiar concept so people have an easier time using the software, and can anticipate how it might work.Consider the ‚Äútrash can‚Äù on your computer, Its a helpful illusion for what happens to a file, but under the hood the root level command is something like ‚Äúrm -i mydir/*‚Äù. The command is hard to remember, and requires a lot more advanced knowledge of the system to use it. So the illusion of a trash can, while innacurate, is a helpful illusion (lie) to help a normal user understand what‚Äôs happening.This isn‚Äôt the case here. The designers are creating an illusion of child-like behaviors, and eliciting our instinct to engage, nurture, play with and protect a child (notice the oversized head and big eyes?)‚Ä¶but its unclear why that‚Äôs necessary in this case, or to what end?This robot was developed by a multi-billion dollar corporation. Their business model depends on the ‚Äúwilling suspension of disbelief‚Äù. Disney needs us to love its characters and stories, to believe in ‚Äúmagic‚Äù and emotionally invest in their intellectual property to keep expensive theme parks and movie theaters filled, purchase their toys and subscribe to their services. They make great movies and world-class experiences but we know these things aren‚Äôt real. That isn‚Äôt what is happening here.The ethics of human-centered design requires we put people ahead of#technology, that the experiences we design are trustworthy, using metaphor and illusion only as a means to help users anticipate outcomes or understand the system they are working in.Disney is creating an illusion that evokes an emotional connection and engenders a sense of trust that the technology is incapable of  reciprocating. It can easily be used to manipulate us.Playing with our emotional response is uncomfortably close to the tactics used by con artists to prey on the trust and goodwill of their victims.This is an experiment, but corporations don‚Äôt sink millions into R&D with emotional connection as their ultimate goal.Be wary of technology that pretends to care about you. A gizmo can never ‚Äúlove‚Äù you back, and there is always a wizard behind the curtian (and a marketing team) pulling at those heart strings to see how much money comes out.",0.9984,0.6211538461538461,6 ,35,0

Code6,15-03-2023,"The Blink Video Doorbell is down to an all&time low of $35.Amazon has rolled out another sale on smart home devices from its Blink brand, bringing a range of video doorbells and security cameras back down to, or at least near, their lowest prices to date. If you're comfortable with the idea of having an Amazon camera outside of your home, one highlight is the Blink Video Doorbell for $35. That matches the device's all-time low, coming in $15 below Amazon's list price and about $10 off the average street price we've seen in recent months. If you're thinking of picking up a Blink cam for the first time, note that a bundle that pairs the Video Doorbell with the company's Sync Module 2 ‚Äî which lets you view the camera's live feed on-demand and utilize local storage ‚Äî is down to $59, which is about $15 off its usual going rate and $5 more than the best price we've tracked.Blink is essentially the budget counterpart to Amazon's other major smart home subsidiary, Ring. Its Video Doorbell is much more basic than a pricier option like Arlo's Essential Video Doorbell, the top pick from our guide to the best smart home devices, but it still delivers serviceable 1080p video, night vision and the ability to see and speak to people at your door regardless of where you are. The whole thing is relatively easy to install, and it can run off wired power or a couple of AA batteries. Blink says the device can get up to two years of juice, depending on how hard it's put into use.That said, the camera's field of view (135 degrees horizontal, 80 degrees vertical) isn't as wide as higher-end options, and it only works with Amazon's Alexa assistant, not alternative platforms like Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant or IFTTT. And while you don't need any add-ons, the doorbell's storage and live view options are limited without the Sync Module or one of Blink's subscription plans. Without the Module, you'll only receive alerts and a live view when the doorbell senses activity or someone presses its button. Still, this is a worthy option for those looking to install a competent, battery-powered doorbell cam for as little money as possible.¬†Beyond the Video Doorbell, other notable deals include a two-camera kit of Blink's Outdoor security cam, another pick from our best smart home device guide, for $104. That's $5 more than the lowest price we've seen. The sale includes several bundles that mix and match various camera options as well.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget athttps://lnkd.in/gb2TGFmfhttps://lnkd.in/g8vW-uxH",0.9899,0.4594304388422035,0,0,0

With AI's continued growth and development, it's clear that it's going to play an even more significant role in shaping our world in the years to come.From personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous cars and drones, AI is already making a huge impact in our everyday lives. And as the technology progresses, it's going to continue to revolutionize industries like healthcare, finance, transportation, and more.One of the most exciting things about the future of AI is its potential to help us solve some of the world's most pressing challenges. From climate change to healthcare, AI has the ability to process large amounts of data and generate insights that can help us make more informed decisions.Of course, with the great potential of AI comes responsibility. It's important that we continue to have discussions around AI ethics and make sure that the development of AI is guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and fairness.As professionals, it's essential that we stay up to date with the latest developments in AI and understand how it can be applied to our respective fields. By embracing AI and continuing to learn about its capabilities, we can ensure that we are well-positioned to thrive in the new age of technology.So let's stay curious and keep exploring the exciting possibilities of AI together!#AI#future#growth#healthcare#healthcare#finance#artificialintelligence#data#ai#transportation#climatechange#developmentI#futuretech#innovation#technology#machinelearning",0.9942,0.6168446368446369,0,0,0

david mcqueen,15-03-2023,"HEALTHY AI SKEPTICISMArtificial Intelligence (AI) has shaped a way many of us navigate technology. From speech recognition to search engines.Beyond the hype of tools like ChatGTP and Dall-E, or software like Alexa and Siri, I have always been intrigued by not just the models and languages used across various forms of AI, but the ethics behind how this intelligence is created, distributed and who has the major ownership on how most of AI is rolled out and to what ends.Tech Won't Save Us has become one of the most intriguing podcasts I listen to regularly, and on the most recent episode, Dan McQuillan,  a Lecturer in Creative and Social Computing at Goldsmiths, University of London and  author of¬†Resisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence, breaks down his own skepticism around how we embrace AI.Some good nuggets and questions that we should we be asking before we drink the cool aid of  jumping on another tech bandwagon without thinking it through.",0.9777,0.529582146248813,0,4,1 
Swapnil Amin,14-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0

Oracle Tree,13-03-2023,"Exciting news, folks! The buzz around AI and ChatGPT has been hard to miss lately, and we're taking the reins this week to bring you everything you need to know about this game-changing technology.We've got a jam-packed line-up for you, so keep an eye out for our upcoming blog post that will provide you with some incredibly informative insights. But that's not all! We'll be hitting you up every day with fresh and thrilling information about AI that will have you at the edge of your seat. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting topic!But first, let's take a moment to think about how much we've embraced artificial intelligence (AI) over the past decade. From Siri to Tesla Autopilot, Grammarly to Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant to ChatGPT, we're living in a world where AI technology is rapidly evolving and becoming more integrated into our daily lives.As we speak, the conversation around AI is heating up across several industries, including digital marketing, design, writing, psychology, education, and tech. And why shouldn't it? The possibilities of AI are endless and can transform the way we work and live.AI technologies have already started to change the way we create content. For example, have you heard of Descript? It's a tool that can transcribe and analyse audio and video content, making editing a breeze. And let's not forget about Canva, which uses machine learning to make personalized design recommendations and is beta-testing Magic Write in their platform. And for those of us in the video editing space, Wav2Lip generates realistic lip-syncing audio for our videos.But AI's impact doesn't stop there. Runway ML can generate or manipulate images, video, and sound using cutting-edge machine learning models.Now, I know some of you might be worried about the rise of AI and its implications for humanity. However, I want to reassure you that we're not in a Terminator 2-style takeover situation just yet. We must weigh the pros and pitfalls of this new frontier and approach it with caution.So, what do you think about the future of AI and its impact on creativity, information, and humanity as a whole?

Rudy Moenaert,10-03-2023,"THE BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMSHet leest als een who's who van ambitieuze dromen en harde landingen:- Alexa (Amazon)- Fire Phone (Amazon)- Google Glass (Alphabet)- Waymo (Alphabet)- Metaverse (Meta) (Ja hoor, plaats die ook maar in het rijtje)Ik zou kunnen zeggen - ""I told you so long ago."" Het is niet dat ik niet van innovatie hou. De ondraaglijke saaiheid van het normale trok me nooit aan. Innovatie is bovendien de focus geweest van een groot deel van mijn academische carri√®re. Maar simpele journalisten, egotrippers die hun naam in neon letters op Mars willen hebben, managers met een overschot aan geld en een tekort aan technisch vernuft, en een goede hypemachine voor de nieuwe technologie√´n dragen ertoe bij dat de samenleving telkens opnieuw vergeet dat innovatie v√©√©l trager gaat dan gedacht. Iedere degelijk wetenschappelijk onderbouwde studie van innovatie en technologische vooruitgang zal tonen dat innovatie langer duurt dan gedacht, de ontgoochelingen veel groter zijn dan geanticipeerd, en de ontnuchterende zelfreflecties veel talrijker vooraf ingeschat.De redenen zijn eenvoudig - enerzijds is de vernieuwing technologische uitdagend en anderzijds verloopt de adoptie ervan vermoeiend traag. Innovatie vereist immers gedragsverandering, en dat is iets wat het merendeel van de mensen niet echt leuk vindt. In de woorden van Lester Thurow - ""Sociology always beats technology, but eventually sociology changes."" Dat het veranderen van die 'sociologie' zeer traag gebeurt, vergeet men al te vaak.  In de woorden van Paul Ormerod - ""Most experiments fail."" Bon, hoe waar dit ook is, met dergelijk fatalisme komen we ook niet bij een betere wereld, natuurlijk. It spoils the fun big time.Het is natuurlijk ambigu - het zijn de gekke projecten die de wereld vooruitbranden. En dus moeten we af en toe geloven dat die radicale innovatie zal lukken. Maar dat is precies de essentie van 'geloof' - meegaan in een gedachtegoed zonder dat er empirisch bewijs is dat het √©cht goed komt. De Ongelovige Thomas is een rolmodel dat iets meer mag worden gewaardeerd in de huidige techgekte. Eind januari tankte ik mijn Q5 (diesel) vol in Kitzb√ºhel, en ik reed zonder bijtanken 1000 km huiswaarts. Zal mijn volgende wagen elektrisch zal zijn? Geloof ik dat er snel een elektrische wagen zal zijn van pakweg ‚Ç¨45.000, die er niet belachelijk uitziet, en die √©cht een actieradius van >800km heeft?

Let√≠cia Tainara Souza,15-03-2023,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, hist√≥rico de tend√™ncias e evolu√ß√µes, aqui v√£o algumas das tend√™ncias de marketing para 2023:ü§≥üèª Marketing de influ√™ncia: o marketing de influ√™ncia chegou pra ficar e continuar√° a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conte√∫do para alcan√ßar p√∫blicos espec√≠ficos (√ì a base da Virginia a√≠, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).üéÅ Personaliza√ß√£o: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experi√™ncia personalizada e relevante, e as empresas est√£o investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estrat√©gias para atender a essa demanda.üìº V√≠deo marketing: o v√≠deo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produ√ß√£o de v√≠deo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Ent√£o investe nisso. A era dos est√°ticos morreu).üîä Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas est√£o come√ßando a adotar estrat√©gias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personaliza√ß√£o tamb√©m).üì© Marketing de conte√∫do: este continuar√° a desempenhando um papel importante na constru√ß√£o de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisar√£o investir em conte√∫do de alta qualidade e em estrat√©gias de distribui√ß√£o para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.üéØ Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experi√™ncia perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estrat√©gias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor est√° em todos os canais e √© inteligente pensar em estrat√©gias adaptadas em cada um deles.üé≤ Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas est√£o cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estrat√©gias de an√°lise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).ü§ñB√îNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estrat√©gias e materiais publicit√°rios tamb√©m √© algo que n√£o tem volta - e que bom! Se voc√™ √© um profissional da √°rea, sugiro come√ßar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estrat√©gias e tomadas de decis√£o. Pois como diz a famosa m√∫sica de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por a√≠, ""hoje √© um novo dia, de um novo tempo que come√ßou.

Kornel Grunwald,15-03-2023,"That is an interesting one: 'In an interview with the Financial Times, Microsoft‚Äôs CEO Satya Nadella labelled the first generation of voice assistants ‚Äúdumb as a rock‚Äù, including Cortana and Siri from Apple and Alexa and Google Assistant from Google. When asked about voice assistants in 2016, Nadella reportedly said ‚ÄúBots are the new apps‚Äù.'I can follow the logic that the promise of voice bots fell short of expectations and how GPT-related innovation is finally realizing a portion of that potential. But the big gap is still missing. And it was not about 'dumbness' that made bots really annoying.A few years ago, voicebots took centre stage with the promise of revolutionizing customer service and user experience. However, their limited understanding of natural language, context, and complexity made them less effective than anticipated. Users often found themselves frustrated with their interactions, leading to a decline in their adoption. I have heard also how difficult it was for these companies to deal with local dialects and small language fluctuations, and do the proper job to annotate datasets with such voice samples.Then GPT enters the stage. Here are two of the ways in which GPT-powered solutions have outshined voicebots:1. Enhanced natural language understanding: GPT-based models can comprehend context and nuance.2. High-quality generation: GPT-powered AI can create human-like responses.Voicebots may not have lived up to their initial hype, but GPT-related innovation has stepped in to fill that void. But does it really?We still are to see a proper missing link to be provided by new innovation: understanding of our voices.How do understand the human voice, if we just continue to speak as we do - I am not sure if you realize how unusual our patterns of speaking are. But beyond that, how tech can listen to those who struggle with some voice-related disabilities or impairments? Or how to get around the 'weirdness' of non-native speakers being fluent in the new language?These are, by far, not trivial or simple tasks, and as much as I can see the GPT revolution giving us better chances at providing great experience once voice is transcribed into text, it is still far from breaking that frontier and making our voice the main interface with technology.But considering the fact that I personally know a couple of specialists in ML/AI looking into this specific problem, I bet we are in for something big soon.Interesting times.#voice#ai",0.9621,0.3966063069721607,1 ,2,0

Eine erfolgreiche Integration von KI in den Industrieprozess erfordert einen interdisziplin√§ren Austausch zwischen verschiedenen Parteien und kann mit Aufwand verbunden sein. Um die Vorteile von KI optimal zu nutzen, sollten Unternehmen nicht nur ihre F√§higkeit zur Datensammlung und -haltung einsetzen, sondern auch den Austausch zwischen Datenerzeugern und -nutzern f√∂rdern (Data Mesh).
