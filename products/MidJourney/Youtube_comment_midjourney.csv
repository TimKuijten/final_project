I’m really happy to have found your channel. Your content is so existential and thought-provoking. I’m always waiting for your next video.

Don’t worry about videos taking a while or whatever; this sort of content takes a lot of time and effort, and I’m sure everyone is aware of the amount of work you put into making these.

I discovered MidJourney the other day and was absolutely blown away. It’s insane what technology and AI can do even today, and they are still in their infancy.",0.8425,0.5974206349206349,17-09-2022,105,10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI

Web3 wont be crypto based or integrated.
It will be a almost seamless ai integration of visual, text and media.
Eventually most content will be ai generated.

Ive only screwed around with chatgpt a little as well as midjourney but given the right prompts and data training; most people will stop creating things the old fashioned way.
Why bother when an ai can do it cheaper and faster, with same or better quality?
With all the good and mostly bad that entails.

It wont kill human generated content completely it will seriously put a dent in it.

It's enhanced my productivity tenfold and is now an invaluable tool that I don't know if I could ever go back on... however there is absolutely no doubt that GPT does and will cause incomprehensible repercussions in society.. and we're just getting started.  Kids no longer have to do homework, many types of graphic artists, painters, story writers, editors, etc careers will be soon obsolete.. except for highly skilled.. 

People really have no idea what's coming, and it's coming FAST.  Whichever company is able to product a robot that can do simple labor and tasks (tesla optimus perhaps), boom there goes millions of jobs.  Granted who wants to scrub toilets, mow lawns, etc.. it's a waste of human capabilities, and should be replaced by Ai anyway... but our current economy isn't ready for such a massive disruption that this will bring.

For example, I just wrote a custom app that was written at least half by AI and all graphics were made by midjourney.. it's great since I don't have to find a graphic artist to help me with UI.. as the current results are vastly superior to any past product UI designers i've worked with... and I get unlimited prototypes and fine tuning lol.  Probably won't be long before many basic coding needs are met by AI as well, especially if it can write file structures.  It will be very interesting to see how the future of AI unfolds...

Whether its Neuralink, ChatbotGPTs or Midjourney art creations.
 
With such things coming out, really the only people who will succeed are those already rich and those who control these AI.
 
People don't seem to realize that the idea of AI and Robots taking over every human job is by no means a fantasy, and by the end of our lifetimes many jobs will already be robot operated unless something changes.
 
It also poses an extreme human life endangerment, as someone in the Airforce, I love getting to use the drones. But, as they progress and get ever more dangerous, and with AI potentially being able to take the role of the drone operators in the next few years, warfare would be even worse then it is now.
And such tech could possibly induce more warfare then there is today.
 
And, my final point, I know many people (like myself, I guess) who are against this, and in recent years due to global events extremism is on the rise.
It could go as far as too causing world rebellions, and that is by no means a fantasy either as I know people who would easily take out their gun and fight.",-0.8569,0.5447222222222222,17-02-2023,2,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30TpiDwnMYU

Mid Journey’s weakness is that it can create faces and hands that are terrible, so I usually add the words “very detailed facial features.” One thing that has taken me awhile to figure out is the use of Seeds. At the end of a prompt, if you type- -seed (like seed 1 or seed 2,etc, if you like most of the work, you can copy the text with seed, but edit the text any way you want. Except for what you changed, with a seed the rest of the image will be unchanged. To date, there are 50 billion images in these AIs, basically every image, or photo is in that AI. Overall the images you showed do paint a coherent story. I do believe that AI has not learned much about emotion and facial expressions. I think the experiment you did works well. I’ve done a number of Angels on Mid Journey.

would that

A) Make the hamster an artist?
B) Or my mom the artist?
C) Or neither?

Midjourney can actually generate images based on one word or “non-word” prompts. or “by accident.” 

I don’t think it’s fair for someone to use raw Midjourney output, post it on a gallery somewhere (as they often do) and consider it their own art. It’s simply not their own art. 

Not unless they creative iterative art using a model trained on either 

1. open sourced content 
2. commons content 
3. their own artwork.
4. licensed art

Artists should be compensated for the use of their art in the training of these generative art models.

              cwagular            ,"As an artist and a programmer, here is my large pile of thoughts about this:

I have mixed feelings about this as many of you also probably do. It will certainly disrupt the commercial art industry and my heart goes out to the freelancers that will be affected by this. Perhaps sites like Pinterest should also be considering how these algorithms can disrupt mood-boards etc. 

But if you first use the tool, you will realize that many of the colors, textures and design elements that the algorithms add to your images are selected from the data it is trained on without much of your own intention or context. The algorithms by default start with literal random noise and builds the image from there. You can of course add your own images and refine the prompt details, making your results more and more specific to get to the final render you want. What do we call this process? 

To get something decent from this, you still need intention, decent taste, a discerning eye, perhaps some comedic or poetic intuition as well when coming up with the prompts. (You will also find that as you add more and more details to your prompts, the results may start to break down. Maybe this is something that will improve over time, or maybe I myself am not skilled enough at prompt generation to avoid these pitfalls)

You create these images based on data made from the hard work of countless artists before. IP and legal stuff will certainly be an interesting question with these algorithms….

Would I say that images created by this tool were created by me? Not personally. I would say that I came up with the prompt idea, and guided the AI tool to arrive at a result that I wanted. It feels somewhat collaborative. It does certainly bother me when people take raw images from these tools and say “look what I made!”. The AI fills in too many design decisions for me to ever feel comfortable saying that I made those choices, unless I happened to make the prompt specific enough to do so. Some other artists have made those design choices already, and ideally these algorithms would give them some credit. 

My point is, good design is purposeful and design decisions should be made with actual purpose/intention, contextualized by the needs of your project. Examples: this character needs five feathers on their wing because it is symbolic for something, or this new smartphone needs to be in this shape for this very specific usability reason, etc.

The random search of these algorithms may get lucky and arrive at an image that will exactly satisfy your needs, especially if your needs are not very specific. For an actual commercial project like a game, movie, product design etc., more often many of the images produced by this tool are not good enough for a final render. 

This tool is good for brainstorming ideas, providing bottomless inspiration for design elements, and also can be a great source of material for digitally inclined creatives. I have seen artists generate several of these images and take elements from each, Photoshopping elements of them together into a purposeful and meaningful digital collage piece of sorts. 3D artists can use it to make textures for their games or renders. It significantly lowers the barrier to creation, and will no doubt disrupt the industry. I even have a friend who uses it in their DnD group to make backgrounds for their games. 

The value of a digital image will be reassessed under these conditions; perhaps more emphasis will be placed on the poetry or ideas behind these synthetic images. Not to mention that these AI cannot create a physical painting. They cannot create a physical piece of pottery made by hand and burned in a kiln for three days of of the coast of some distant island in Japan. When a robot makes its own conscious decision to travel to some far off land to paint the sunset off the shore and comes back with masterpiece that embodies its own experience with love, nostalgia, and heartbreak, maybe that will be the day that artists of all mediums should be afraid. Until then, these algorithms are just tools

Perhaps there will also be value on art created without the use of AI, 100% human organic wholesale kind of thing. I would not be surprised if there was a backlash to using AI tools in some sectors, especially as we are saturated with more and more of these synthetic images. Maybe there will also be emphasis on the process people use to get their results, for example those painters that record videos of themselves painting are a work of art in and of themselves.

Further disruptive technologies powered by AI are certain to come; videos, music etc can also be generated by AI. But again, the algorithms still require a human to come up with the idea (driven by a creative impulse, design need, etc), refine the result through several iterations, doctor the results (perhaps some post processing, not to mention fixing the terrifying faces these early algorithms create). It is not replacing humans quite yet. 

The real danger lies in how the commercial industry will use this stuff. We already live in a world where many “creative” decisions are made simply to get the most money, and not necessarily to create the most original or thought provoking pieces of work. I am worried that these algorithms will exacerbate problems we are seeing in an already stilted media industry, where pop culture already feels rehashed and derivative. It sounds incredibly boring to live in a world where synthetic images are created from datasets of rehashed synthetic images. But that is also why these algorithms cannot replace the human aspect. 

These algorithms can recombine data in ways that can even be considered creative by some definitions, but they simply cannot incorporate new lived experience. The works made by them are by definition derivative. Additionally, the images you are allowed to create will be limited by the prompts you are allowed to use, dictated by the companies that own the tools. If you have used DALLE-2 or Midjourney, you will realize that they are both especially strict to prevent legal issues on their end. In that sense, when you are using these algorithms, your creativity is still pretty bounded. 

Humans will by virtue of living will always have new data and experiences available to them, and that is where the freshest, rawest material comes from in my opinion. That “you couldn’t make this stuff up” moment when someone is telling a story. 

Don’t stay inside looking at a screen all day, live life to the fullest (and perhaps I should take my own advice, ha). Go outside, fall in love with something or someone, then lose it all and do it again. Live your life, acquire new experiences, write about them, make creative projects that reflect what you have learned. Don’t compare yourself to other humans or AI algorithms.

Midjourney takes that away entirely. You simply enter a little command and it just makes it right there and then, instantly devaluing art. Decades of experience and training, all for nothing, because a program can generate it all in a manner of seconds. Sure, it's not perfect yet, but this is literally only the first version. It won't take long before you can talk to it like an actual artist, taking your feedback, improving it, all for essentially free.

              Michael J Walls            ,"I find it ridiculous to call those who are ""Prompting"" an A.I. to create the artwork on their behalf, based on the user's thought salad, can be taken seriously as ""Artists"".  

Anyone who has no concept of the time, effort, or energy it takes to create an original piece of artwork by hand, who does not use the internal vision of their own minds,  influences and experiences they consume during the course of their own lives, which truly make their own works unique to themselves, but choose to use the A.I. to produce randomized work samples on behalf of them, could never in real life, so easily create similar works on their own, in any reasonable amount of time, or expense, without God given talent, or hard earned practice and work.

Those who use an A.I. to produce high concept, detailed artwork to pawn off as ""their own"", and at the same time, have the hubris to call themselves ""Artist"" should NEVER be considered, ""Artist"".  

The fact that they are using ""Artificial Intelligence"" rather than ""Authentic Intelligence"" to create for them makes this clear.  Using text to create artwork via an A.I., turns the user simply into a client, who basically is commissioning artwork from an A.I. subcontractor to produce the artwork for them.  Those calling themselves ""Artist"" who use A.I. to produce on behalf of themselves are hardly even ""Coders"" at this point.  

Simply give credit where credit is due.   The A.I. is the Artist. 

Everyone else that feeds the A.I. it's instructions are either ""Prompters"" or ""Thoughts"" that feed the Midjourney machine, and those apps like it, which in reality, doesn't even think for itself until told to do so, which makes it essentially no more useful than a microwave oven until you prompt it to cook for you.  And after entering the time and pressing ""Start"" on your microwave oven, does that make the user a chef?  Is the microwave the real cook?  

The bottom line that I've seen since this new wave of A.I. art has taken it's grip on the global internet community, is that apps like this have the potential to fracture and diminish the spirit of the ""Authentic Artists"", old and young.  The reality now is that anyone who is “prompting” a machine to produce content that, if you take the time to give a good, thorough look, much of it is essentially the same.  

How many people out there have actually taken the time to really look at the A.I. artwork itself, and experience it?  How many have spent any time to try to understand what the artist's intent was, or think about how does the artwork make them feel? Or where did this idea I’m experiencing come from, and what kind of person had the vision to produce this artwork? What kind of life must they have lived to inspire them to create this vision?  

The answer for A.I. generated art is ZERO.  ""Imagine/"" is your answer.  

There is simply too much A.I. produced content to really appreciate it all.  The only real winners here will be the Coders who created this gargantuan ""Artificial Mind Monster"" as they sop up all of your precious, hard earned dollars with subscription fees, just so the user can play with prompts, pretend to be ""Artists"" and use an A.I. to scrape up all the available IP that permeates the World Wide Web to create it's ""art"".  

Without this content, this A.I. would produce nothing.   If there was a way to look at all the imagery that this A.I. used to create on behalf of these ""Prompters"", and find out and pinpoint exactly what elements were used to generate these most ""Amazing Images"", well, I bet that would be one Hell of a bill that would be owed to the countless original artists that contributed to these ""Amazing Pieces of Art"".  No doubt, it's quite amazing, beautiful, wondrous, and all that stuff.  

But at the end of the day, it's ARTIFICIAL.  FAKE.  

The prompter has no more right to these works, as do the coders who created the algorithms used to hijack other's imagery, just to cobble them together into something illegitimate, that will in time likely displace and demotivate graphic artists, designers, and other ""Authentic Artists"" from producing, and will also give incentive to corporations from paying  ""Authentic Artists"" to produce, when all they need do is pay a fee, type in the right words, and hit refresh, until they come up with something that fits the bill.  

The only ones in control are the ones with control of the levers.  Without their code, or their servers, and without the fertile digital earth full of content that precedes these apps, there would be no “A.I. Artists”.  

I would advise everyone who creates to learn how to code for themselves, and perhaps find a way to permanently tag your works so that no one may ""Scrape"" it and pawn it off as a hidden brush stroke within their ""original artwork"", without crossing your palm with silver first.  I believe turning your art into NFT's with a blockchain stamp is a way to protect your art.  Just a thought.  I'm not sure.  Learn how to create the tools yourself and do not give in to the notion that ""Authentic Artists "" should give up because of the ""Artificial Artist”, but continue to create and cultivate your own original art that will start and end with your time here on earth, and will live long after you do, and mean something to someone else that you'll never meet or know,  countless eyes and minds, connecting with your ""Authentic Art"" and not be forgotten like the countless and endless samples that Midjourney and other apps like it crank out daily, that, aside from the ""Wow!” and “That looks so cool!” Factor, will be easily forgotten, and lost in endless threads of ""Artificial Works"".  

I wonder at which point do these A.I. Art Apps start cannibalizing their own creations and start to just become digital, visual, mud?

That old saying applies here, ""If it was easy, everyone would be doing it.""  Well, this A.I. Art is easy.  That's why everyone is doing it.""  To think all of that time users spend hitting refresh, and upscaling, and typing in all of those prompts, could serve their human experience in a much richer way, by picking up a pencil, a piece of paper, learning anatomy, understanding color, shape, shade, and light, proportion, perspective, depth, and so many other things, simply because they lack the drive to do nothing more than type in ""Imagine/ Vomit Words Here"" to have and A.I. produce ""their artwork"" and call themselves ""Artist"".

Their results will be countless, impressive in the moment, like burning flash paper, then forgotten in an instant, until the next scroll of the mouse wheel, or slide of the finger tip on the Magic Mouse.  

Remember those stupid bored ape NFT's?  Anybody care about them now?  Not really, as far as I can tell.  True Artists don't need A.I. to create for them.  From analog brush to digital , film to video, all of the tools are out there for everyone to use, and in time, the true wheat will be separated from the chaff.

And look out filmmakers, Meta/Facebook is already going down this road with their own brand of A.I. Video/Filmmaking.  Writers, Musicians, I'd imagine you are next on the A.I. chopping block.  

This is just one person's opinion.  I've used Midjourney.  It's very cool, but at the end of the day, it's not my Art, because A.I. is incapable of producing my Art. It is more than capable of borrowing other's Art and producing it's own style of Art for everyone else that “prompts” it to do so.  It's neat, just not for me.

No doubt there are many ""Authentic Artists"" out there that are exploring these A.I. Content Producers, as there are novices, or non artists, who are doing the same, and that's fine.  It's a great time to be alive.  Technology has improved and enhanced our lives in many profound ways.  But let it improve, not replace.  

Don't forget what it truly means to create and to be a true Artist.  You don't need an A.I. Content Producer to make great works of Art.  It's a fun toy, but it can never replace the originality and authenticity of a Biological, Authentic, Artist.   Do not compare yourself as a creator or give up because of the A.I. Artists.

You are only comparing yourself with something Artificial. The A.I. is not thinking about you.  It's standing by, waiting for it's next ""Prompt"".

Good luck Authentic Artists. Do not shrink under the tidal wave of A.I. art that you see, in fact, don't even waste your time looking at it.  A.I. Art is Fake.  It has no real Soul.  It took no suffering or effort to will it into existence.  Just keystrokes and refreshing the algorithm, until the “prompter sees something they like. 

If this A.I. Art generator somehow inspires someone to pick up a pencil or a paint brush and create Authentic Art, great!  But getting these amazing results with little effort is hard to resist.  You never know what will grow out of this.

But the idea of the A.I. Artist is false.  It's a vapor.  It's a phantasm.  And the content, no matter if your User Name is connected to it, is not ""uniquely yours.""  It's not YOURS.  It effort belongs to an A.I. app., with a subscription fee attached to it.  And without the app to do all the heavy lifting, what is the measure of an A.I. Artist then?

Remember, with your own creations, worked by your own hands, with your own tools, vision, and intelligence, you are an AUTHENTIC ARTIST.  

You are REAL.  

Ignore the A.I. Artist.  Continue to create your own, subscription free, Authentic Artwork in spite of it. 

Sign it.  Protect it.  Share it with the world.  Sell it.  There is no shame in that.  And most importantly, don't stop making YOUR own Authentic Art.  

Good luck. God Bless you and yours.",0.9997,0.6061811428235849,None,0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw
              TheMostFrench            ,"It's interesting to think about, I was sitting in the midjourney discord watching people pump stuff out with a few keywords, and made a few ideas of my own. I thought to myself ""Is there any point in learning to draw or make digital art anymore with stuff like this?"" and I think the answer is still yes, because the AI still depends heavily on things that already exist to be able to generate ideas. For example, I tried to describe celebrities and politicians combined with fictional characters (e.g imagine donald trump as darth vader) but it could only create something based on photos and images which already existed, which means that it struggles with certain positions and poses - an experienced artist could conceive anything from any angle including things which don't exist yet.

I've made my own products like tshirt designs and stickers by using collages of photos and magazine/newspaper clippings combined with drawings; things like photoshop and digital scanners made a huge difference to art production already. Being able to change the colours of objects, create lines and shapes where none previously existed, which have adjustable width and curvature, and then save practically unlimited copies or make new layers for experimenting with new ideas, all without putting the original piece of work at any harm was absolutely mind blowing. 

What IS changing is that people without any artistic experience or background are able to create very vivid things with next to no effort (they are alsothings which might take artists hours to create with current tools), but to get EXACTLY what they want they will still need the assistance of someone who knows what they're doing. The AI will serve as a good starting point e.g ""I want something that looks like this, but can you change xyz"" which is a service that a lot of people already request. 

In the future it's possible that actual language could become a valuable currency if we need specific prompts to generate something valuable. Certain AIs might come with their own descriptive vocabularies which must be registered with the user like a vocal license - consider the possibilities of AI controlled 3D printing where you can ask it to build whatever you describe.",0.9895,0.519665138782786,17-08-2022,30,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw
              vince            ,"I have been painting digitally for over 10 years now. I've been playing around with lines, contrasts, brush style, traditional and old master style on digital. It's been so much fun, and I'm really glad to get that experience before AI starts blowing up. Also, reproduction ""in a style of..."" has been around for a long time in the art world. AI just simplifies the process and the tool.

About MidJourney, it's amazing if you want to get new ideas for paintings, concepts, etc. I think every AAA studio will create their ""own version"" of Midjourney with unique options for generating characters, landscapes, visual effects, storyboards, etc. And then apply copyright and security on it to prevent access to random people. At the same time, NFT Art can get a huge boost from this AI work. I think it will be a new market with the classic/contemporary art market that already exists. 

But does AI replace the artist? Digital painting and 3D are already answering these questions. But, there are still oil painters on this earth who like to paint on a traditional medium.  

In terms of medium, a visual artist with experience has a huge advantage over someone who just puts in quick words with no art knowledge. Also, if there is no human artist left, there is no creativity left and after decades of using a single prompt, Ai will be stuck on a loop of something already created in the past. This is the death of human art and an endless vicious loop for Ai's tools. As long as there have been humans on earth, I think artists will always be useful, they just have a new role over time.",0.8456,0.4157163149350649,17-08-2022,27,4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw

And this is by buying some app u can steal from any past famous artist by typing their name and u gain their style their abilities to create a piece based on what the AI creates for you is completely stealing someone else’s skills, so go ahead pay for an AI app and sell, which i feel is stupid cuz it seems any human can do this with AI so save money and get this midjourney app yourself and have an AI CREATE IT ALL",0.951,0.5772727272727273,17-01-2023,0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=704brywiyfw
