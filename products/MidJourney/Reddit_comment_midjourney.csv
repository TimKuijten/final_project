olegkikin,02-03-2023,You can't just judge AI by its current state. Look at the trajectory. Look at the accelerating speed of improvement. Midjourney V4 is freaking magical. GPT-3 is quite good.

TopFloorApartment,02-03-2023,"Hm. I've been using midjourney to create some images to use in my campaigns, and for things like landscapes it can work pretty well.

AsteriskYouth,01-03-2023,"BIPOC artist with a disability here. I really appreciate John Oliver touching on some of the ethical and legal issues with ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and other generative (really, in the case of the arts, destructive) AI. While many of us recognize the potential for this technology to help cure cancer, HIV, and other diseases we would all like to see disappear, there is no equivalent case to be made for stealing the work of artists in order to facilitate further large-scale theft. There is no great societal benefit.
