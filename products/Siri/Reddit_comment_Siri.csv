seemsprettylegit,17-03-2017,"Since your an expert  I would really love your input on some thoughts- I've always played around with the idea that to create a self concscious mind an interesting strategy would be to unify two AI computers into one system and have them communicate stimuli and information to eachother to eventually create analysis through a sort of high speed internal discourse. Kind of like how we have our own discussions with our selves in our heads before we come to conclusions, it would be like having watson privately speaking to watson in order to figure out what watson thinks. Maybe by bouncing information back and forth internally between AI systems one can create a sort of artificial mind capable of thought, and maybe the more systems (or voices) its being internally bounced around can effect the level/predictability of the AI? I mean this could all be nonsense but I've seen it possible for something like siri to hold a bit of a conversation with another siri and it gave me the idea? Id be really interested what someone with a much more educated understanding thinks of this.
