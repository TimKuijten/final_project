amalgam_reynolds,17-03-2021,Google Assistant has very good male and female voices. I've been using a male voice a couple years and it's great.,0.807,0.3793333333333334,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/mih2id/women_are_perceived_differently_from_men_even/

zackline,17-03-2017,If this replaces the Google assistant I'd not be happy. But I don't buy devices with TouchWiz anyway.,-0.2498,1.0,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5zj5mu/samsung_confirms_its_new_artificial_intelligence/
,17-03-2017,They keep putting it on the same devices as Google Assistant. Just no. It's an annoying pop-up if anything.,-0.5994,0.5125,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5zj5mu/samsung_confirms_its_new_artificial_intelligence/
LuckyLanno,17-02-2023,"I'm curious about how they will integrate new results into the model. Will they be able to update it hourly, or daily? I guess they could have it work like Google Assistant, where it just uses search for you. I'm hoping for more though.",0.765,0.5159090909090909,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10vikbb/google_announces_bard_ai_in_response_to_chatgpt/
Antonskarp,17-03-2018,"They're using a lot of it for themselves as well.  For instance if you go to google maps and look up a restaurant, it will tell you the average amount of time people spend there. Google knows the average time people spend there because they track phones. Google collects data because with enough data, google becomes psychic. Their endgame is having a google Assistant that knows what you want before you do. In the future, google might let me know that I should reschedule the table I booked at that restaurant, because the average time people sit there combined with the average walking time to the cinema means I will miss the move I've bought tickets for.",0.2023,0.3708333333333333,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/99oxgz/im_ryan_nakashima_technology_writer_for_the/
