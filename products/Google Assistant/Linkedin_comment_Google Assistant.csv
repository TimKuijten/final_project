Alexander Steiner,15-03-2023,"𝗥𝗣𝗔 𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲! ❌Seit Jahrzehnten bekommen wir das Versprechen, dass wir Befehle nicht mehr als Code eingeben müssen.Hierfür gab es schon die unterschiedlichsten Ansätze, die natürlich über die Zeit hin immer besser und ausgefeilter wurden.  🙌Alternativen für die Command Line sollen nach dem Willen der Entwickler unter anderem sein:🔹 Die grafische Benutzeroberfläche (GUI), die durch Icons, Buttons und Menüs die Interaktion mit dem Computer erleichtert und weniger technisches Wissen erfordert als die Command Line.🔹 Die ""Natural Language Interfaces"", die es ermöglichen, den Computer in natürlicher Sprache zu steuern, ähnlich wie man mit einem menschlichen Gesprächspartner sprechen würde.🔹 Und nicht zu vergessen Sprachassistenten wie Siri, Google Assistant und Alexa. Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt. Letztendlich ist es nur ein Werkzeug, keine Philosophie oder Wissenschaft.Was ist Deine Meinung dazu? ✍#rpa#digitalisierung#automatisierung#prozessautomation#mittelstand",-0.9945,0.35,2 ,3,0
Jessica Ong,15-03-2023,"https://lnkd.in/gPJj2-2GChat GPT vs Google Assistant vs Siri vs BixbyWhich AI works better?In my opinion, Chat GPT is more a serious dedicator compiling info rather than we all click on blogs for 100 tools to look for - as an example. Basically, a great virtual assistant for you to compile niched info and even become your greatest blog writer ever. So, would you stop hiring content writer? You can copy and paste the robot's content...but still, gonna need a pair of human eyes to cross check contents and plagiarism. Also, for the free access, it allows mostly 3 usage/ day.However, Chat GPT doesn't talk like Google Assistant or Siri, and normally I will voice talk to google Assistant for some entertainment instead.Is Chat GPT the top Virtual Assistant currently?

You are coming fromMicrosoftbackground so let me try to give some examples from your field (thank you chatgpt):Here's a list of projects or technologies that Microsoft either dropped, discontinued, or failed to capitalize on, which later turned out to be successful in the hands of other companies or in different forms:- Tablet PCs: Microsoft introduced the idea of a tablet PC with Windows XP Tablet PC Edition back in 2002. However, the devices didn't gain much traction, and the idea remained dormant until Apple released the iPad in 2010, which revolutionized the tablet market.- Smartphones and mobile operating systems: Microsoft developed Windows Mobile and later Windows Phone as mobile operating systems to compete with iOS and Android. Despite its early presence in the mobile market, Microsoft failed to gain significant market share and eventually discontinued Windows Phone. Meanwhile, iOS and Android continued to dominate the smartphone market.- Wearable technology: Microsoft introduced the SPOT (Smart Personal Objects Technology) watch in 2004, a smartwatch that could display news, weather, and other information. The project was discontinued in 2008. A few years later, companies like Apple, Samsung, and Fitbit successfully launched their own smartwatches and fitness trackers, creating a thriving wearable technology market.- Virtual assistants: Microsoft's Cortana, introduced in 2014, was an early player in the virtual assistant market. However, it failed to gain significant traction compared to competitors like Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple's Siri. While Cortana still exists, its presence and impact in the virtual assistant market are relatively limited.Personally, I am not jumping with excitement when big companies are announcing their involvement in some#web3technology because most of them and their practices, are the reason why this technology exists - but do I use it as social proof to encourage others to try it?

Joseph Babi,15-03-2023,"""Hey Google... Hey Siri... Alexa""Do you catch yourself saying these phrases during your day?As voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant become more ubiquitous, voice search is quickly becoming the new frontier of search engine optimization (SEO). In fact, in 2022, it's estimated that voice searches accounted for half of all online searches.But how can you optimize your website for voice search? Here are some tips:1. Use conversational keywords: People speak differently than they type, so it's essential to use conversational keywords and long-tail phrases that match how people talk.2. Optimize for featured snippets: Many voice assistants use featured snippets (also known as position zero) to provide answers to voice search queries. Optimizing your content to appear in featured snippets can increase your chances of appearing in voice search results.3. Focus on local search: Many voice searches are location-based, so optimizing for local SEO can increase your visibility in voice search results.4. Improve website speed: Voice assistants prefer websites that load quickly, so it's crucial to optimize your website's speed for better voice search rankings.By optimizing your website for voice search, you can increase your chances of appearing in voice search results and reaching a new audience of potential customers. So, don't overlook this important aspect of SEO!Have you optimized your website for voice search yet?

Mohamed Salah,15-03-2023,"Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are changing the game when it comes to voice search. By using these tools, users can ask for information or perform tasks without having to type out a query. As a result, businesses need to start thinking about how they can optimize their content for these platforms.Successful voice search optimization for virtual assistants involves understanding the way people use these tools and creating content that is tailored to their needs. For example, users often use natural language when speaking to virtual assistants, so it's important to create content that answers common questions in a conversational way.If you're looking to reach potential customers through virtual assistants, start by thinking about the types of questions they might ask. Then, create content that answers those questions in a clear and concise manner. You can also optimize your website for voice search by using structured data markup to provide additional context for search engines.Overall, virtual assistants are revolutionizing voice search, and businesses that don't adapt risk falling behind. By understanding the unique challenges and opportunities of this technology, you can create content that stands out and reaches your target audience.#voicesearch#seo#digitalmarketing#searchengineoptimization",0.9811,0.6648148148148149,0,0,0

Md Khairul Islam Tamim,14-03-2023,"5 Hot Topics in Digital Marketing1. Personalization: Personalization is the practice of tailoring marketing messages and experiences to individual consumers based on their preferences, behaviors, and characteristics. With the wealth of data available through digital channels, companies can use personalization to create more relevant and engaging experiences for their customers.2. Video marketing: Video has become an increasingly important part of digital marketing strategies, as it can be used to convey messages in an engaging and memorable way. From social media videos to YouTube ads to live streaming, video can be a powerful tool for building brand awareness and driving engagement.3. Influencer marketing: Influencer marketing involves partnering with social media influencers to promote a brand or product to their followers. As social media has become more influential in shaping consumer behavior, influencer marketing has emerged as a popular way for brands to reach new audiences and build credibility with their customers.4. Voice search: With the growing popularity of voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, optimizing for voice search has become an important consideration for digital marketers. Voice search queries tend to be longer and more conversational than text-based queries, and companies need to adapt their SEO strategies to account for this shift.5. Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in digital marketing to automate tasks, improve personalization, and analyze data. From chatbots to predictive analytics, AI can help companies deliver more efficient and effective marketing experiences to their customers.#digitalmarketing#marketing#seo#brand#help#engagement#video#socialmedia#influencermarketing#artificialintelligence#google#building#consumerbehavior",0.9937,0.5287337662337662,0,2,0

Gaston Algaze,14-03-2023,"During the last couple of months I’ve been trying out ChatGPT, making sure to do it in a way that would go beyond the novelty, trying to address real life challenges.This is what I found.1. It’s relatively easy to use, I can see it embedded in almost every aspect of our daily life. Imagine a smarter Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant.While not entirely smooth yet, it will solve most of the hurdles of modern life. All simple questions will be answered, not googled, answered right here right now.2. There’s a chance people will become more stupid, by relying on AI as people rely today on a GPS to drive everywhere. Experience will still matter, but if we remove people from building such experience, then we’re really putting our own evolution into the AI’s hands.3. Will my job be impacted by this technology? 100% Yes. Will I lose my job? Look if you’re questioning yourself today whether you’re going to lose your job or not, then you probably will. The question is not whether you’ll lose it or not, the question is how you can take this new tool and apply it to make it your own.4. I’m pretty sure this will accelerate the lifecycle of many technologies, products and even cultures. We’re looking at the next real evolutionary stage. And something people don't realize, is that this started not with ChatGPT but many years ago with thousands of other models. AI is coming to stay and we will need to adapt.So now you know what I think the next few years will bring. What's fascinating is that we brought ChatGPT to life by programming it to mirror our own thoughts and expressions. We're now entering a new era where humans won't be the only ones creating things that are uniquely human. There's a growing similarity between the products of human creativity and those of AI. We're even starting to adopt some machine-like characteristics, which makes it easier for robots to learn from us. It's exciting to imagine how humans and robots will work in tandem to achieve incredible feats in the future.So, how do you think AI will impact your world? I'd really like to hear your thoughts...#technology#ai#experience#people#work",0.9835,0.490012225428892,0,23,0
Mariusz Korba,14-03-2023,"Voice Recognition has slipped under your radar!While everyone is talking about ChatGPT, the voice recognition model Whisper (also by OpenAI) might have been underestimated.We all know Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. But equally, I think many, myself included, are underwhelmed by their accuracy, pushing us back to speak to them with somewhat robotic commands or moving back to typing.At the same time, many people who tried to use ChatGPT found it somewhat inaccurate. Still, I can bet that at least some of that inaccuracy is because they didn't write enough contextual information for the AI to understand the question entirely.I think that with accurate voice recognition, the potential us having a meaningful and precise conversation is much more impressive.With accurate speech ➡️ text will come accurate text ➡️ speech. Take Eleven Labs - their model can understand the context of a text, and with proper voice recognition, it can speak back to you with the tone you'd expect based on the context of that text.So, using Whisper to transcribe our question, GPT to form an accurate and comprehensive response, and the Event Labs to convincingly speak back to us could take our conversations with technology to another level. This would make them more human-like, accurate, and finally useful. Sure, these tools still make some mistakes, but they'll become more capable and helpful with time, and we can already see this.In a business environment, you can imagine meetings/calls where AI automatically takes notes and minutes, extracting key facts, actions, new ideas and who started them. Such notes can then be summarised and even written with the preferred level of detail based on each stakeholder's seniority, needs, knowledge, and interests. Each person can then listen to such a summary at their leisure, making it easier and quicker to digest, like listening to an audiobook vs reading a book - all automatic 🤖.In fact, with OpenAI recently releasing APIs, you don't need to imagine this. Instead, you can implement such a workflow now!Naturally, there will be many more helpful use cases, but, like with any new technology, privacy concerns will be, and should be, raised as well.#ai#artificialintelligence#future",0.9897,0.4580457351290685,0,5,0

Eine erfolgreiche Integration von KI in den Industrieprozess erfordert einen interdisziplinären Austausch zwischen verschiedenen Parteien und kann mit Aufwand verbunden sein. Um die Vorteile von KI optimal zu nutzen, sollten Unternehmen nicht nur ihre Fähigkeit zur Datensammlung und -haltung einsetzen, sondern auch den Austausch zwischen Datenerzeugern und -nutzern fördern (Data Mesh). Es empfiehlt sich, KI bereits bei der Prozessentwicklung zu berücksichtigen und wenn möglich zu integrieren, um ihre zukünftige Einbindung zu erleichtern. Ein nachträgliches Hinzufügen von KI kann hingegen zu erhöhter Komplexität führen - ""Man muss das Eisen schmieden, solange es heiß ist"".",-0.1779,0.0,0,6,0

Alexander Steiner,15-03-2023,"𝗥𝗣𝗔 𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲! ❌Seit Jahrzehnten bekommen wir das Versprechen, dass wir Befehle nicht mehr als Code eingeben müssen.Hierfür gab es schon die unterschiedlichsten Ansätze, die natürlich über die Zeit hin immer besser und ausgefeilter wurden.  🙌Alternativen für die Command Line sollen nach dem Willen der Entwickler unter anderem sein:🔹 Die grafische Benutzeroberfläche (GUI), die durch Icons, Buttons und Menüs die Interaktion mit dem Computer erleichtert und weniger technisches Wissen erfordert als die Command Line.🔹 Die ""Natural Language Interfaces"", die es ermöglichen, den Computer in natürlicher Sprache zu steuern, ähnlich wie man mit einem menschlichen Gesprächspartner sprechen würde.🔹 Und nicht zu vergessen Sprachassistenten wie Siri, Google Assistant und Alexa. Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt. Letztendlich ist es nur ein Werkzeug, keine Philosophie oder Wissenschaft.Was ist Deine Meinung dazu? ✍#rpa#digitalisierung#automatisierung#prozessautomation#mittelstand",-0.9945,0.35,2 ,3,0
Nazmul Hassan,15-03-2023,"Search engine optimization (SEO) is constantly evolving as search engines like Google refine their algorithms and new technologies emerge. Here are some possible trends that could shape the future of SEO:Focus on user intent: As search engines become more sophisticated, they are better able to understand the intent behind a user's search query. This means that optimizing for keywords alone is no longer enough. Instead, SEO will increasingly be about understanding what users are looking for and providing them with relevant content and experiences.Importance of voice search: With the rise of smart speakers and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, voice search is becoming more prevalent. SEO strategies will need to adapt to the unique challenges and opportunities of voice search, such as optimizing for natural language queries and local search.Emphasis on mobile-first indexing: More and more people are accessing the internet on their mobile devices, which has led to Google shifting towards mobile-first indexing. This means that websites that are not optimized for mobile devices may suffer in search rankings. SEO will need to prioritize mobile optimization to ensure visibility in search results.Integration with other channels: SEO is increasingly being integrated with other marketing channels, such as social media, email marketing, and content marketing. A holistic approach that considers how SEO fits into the larger marketing picture will be important.Overall, the future of SEO will likely continue to be shaped by advancements in technology and changes in user behavior. SEO professionals will need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and adapt their strategies accordingly to remain effective.#searchengines#seo#marketing#searchengineoptimization#contentmarketing#technology",0.9726,0.5490143784786643,0,0,0

Code6,15-03-2023,"The Blink Video Doorbell is down to an all&time low of $35.Amazon has rolled out another sale on smart home devices from its Blink brand, bringing a range of video doorbells and security cameras back down to, or at least near, their lowest prices to date. If you're comfortable with the idea of having an Amazon camera outside of your home, one highlight is the Blink Video Doorbell for $35. That matches the device's all-time low, coming in $15 below Amazon's list price and about $10 off the average street price we've seen in recent months. If you're thinking of picking up a Blink cam for the first time, note that a bundle that pairs the Video Doorbell with the company's Sync Module 2 — which lets you view the camera's live feed on-demand and utilize local storage — is down to $59, which is about $15 off its usual going rate and $5 more than the best price we've tracked.Blink is essentially the budget counterpart to Amazon's other major smart home subsidiary, Ring. Its Video Doorbell is much more basic than a pricier option like Arlo's Essential Video Doorbell, the top pick from our guide to the best smart home devices, but it still delivers serviceable 1080p video, night vision and the ability to see and speak to people at your door regardless of where you are. The whole thing is relatively easy to install, and it can run off wired power or a couple of AA batteries. Blink says the device can get up to two years of juice, depending on how hard it's put into use.That said, the camera's field of view (135 degrees horizontal, 80 degrees vertical) isn't as wide as higher-end options, and it only works with Amazon's Alexa assistant, not alternative platforms like Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant or IFTTT. And while you don't need any add-ons, the doorbell's storage and live view options are limited without the Sync Module or one of Blink's subscription plans. Without the Module, you'll only receive alerts and a live view when the doorbell senses activity or someone presses its button. Still, this is a worthy option for those looking to install a competent, battery-powered doorbell cam for as little money as possible. Beyond the Video Doorbell, other notable deals include a two-camera kit of Blink's Outdoor security cam, another pick from our best smart home device guide, for $104. That's $5 more than the lowest price we've seen. The sale includes several bundles that mix and match various camera options as well.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget athttps://lnkd.in/gb2TGFmfhttps://lnkd.in/g8vW-uxH",0.9899,0.4594304388422035,0,0,0

The buzz around AI and ChatGPT has been hard to miss lately, and we're taking the reins this week to bring you everything you need to know about this game-changing technology.We've got a jam-packed line-up for you, so keep an eye out for our upcoming blog post that will provide you with some incredibly informative insights. But that's not all! We'll be hitting you up every day with fresh and thrilling information about AI that will have you at the edge of your seat. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting topic!But first, let's take a moment to think about how much we've embraced artificial intelligence (AI) over the past decade. From Siri to Tesla Autopilot, Grammarly to Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant to ChatGPT, we're living in a world where AI technology is rapidly evolving and becoming more integrated into our daily lives.As we speak, the conversation around AI is heating up across several industries, including digital marketing, design, writing, psychology, education, and tech. And why shouldn't it? The possibilities of AI are endless and can transform the way we work and live.AI technologies have already started to change the way we create content. For example, have you heard of Descript? It's a tool that can transcribe and analyse audio and video content, making editing a breeze. And let's not forget about Canva, which uses machine learning to make personalized design recommendations and is beta-testing Magic Write in their platform. And for those of us in the video editing space, Wav2Lip generates realistic lip-syncing audio for our videos.But AI's impact doesn't stop there. Runway ML can generate or manipulate images, video, and sound using cutting-edge machine learning models.Now, I know some of you might be worried about the rise of AI and its implications for humanity. However, I want to reassure you that we're not in a Terminator 2-style takeover situation just yet. We must weigh the pros and pitfalls of this new frontier and approach it with caution.So, what do you think about the future of AI and its impact on creativity, information, and humanity as a whole?

Kornel Grunwald,15-03-2023,"That is an interesting one: 'In an interview with the Financial Times, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella labelled the first generation of voice assistants “dumb as a rock”, including Cortana and Siri from Apple and Alexa and Google Assistant from Google. When asked about voice assistants in 2016, Nadella reportedly said “Bots are the new apps”.'I can follow the logic that the promise of voice bots fell short of expectations and how GPT-related innovation is finally realizing a portion of that potential. But the big gap is still missing. And it was not about 'dumbness' that made bots really annoying.A few years ago, voicebots took centre stage with the promise of revolutionizing customer service and user experience. However, their limited understanding of natural language, context, and complexity made them less effective than anticipated. Users often found themselves frustrated with their interactions, leading to a decline in their adoption. I have heard also how difficult it was for these companies to deal with local dialects and small language fluctuations, and do the proper job to annotate datasets with such voice samples.Then GPT enters the stage. Here are two of the ways in which GPT-powered solutions have outshined voicebots:1. Enhanced natural language understanding: GPT-based models can comprehend context and nuance.2. High-quality generation: GPT-powered AI can create human-like responses.Voicebots may not have lived up to their initial hype, but GPT-related innovation has stepped in to fill that void. But does it really?We still are to see a proper missing link to be provided by new innovation: understanding of our voices.How do understand the human voice, if we just continue to speak as we do - I am not sure if you realize how unusual our patterns of speaking are. But beyond that, how tech can listen to those who struggle with some voice-related disabilities or impairments? Or how to get around the 'weirdness' of non-native speakers being fluent in the new language?These are, by far, not trivial or simple tasks, and as much as I can see the GPT revolution giving us better chances at providing great experience once voice is transcribed into text, it is still far from breaking that frontier and making our voice the main interface with technology.But considering the fact that I personally know a couple of specialists in ML/AI looking into this specific problem, I bet we are in for something big soon.Interesting times.#voice#ai",0.9621,0.3966063069721607,1 ,2,0

Yakup Öztürk,15-03-2023,"KI wird zunehmend in Alltagssituationen eingesetzt, zum Beispiel in intelligenten Lautsprechern und Sprachassistenten wie Amazon Alexa oder Google Assistant, um Nutzeranfragen zu verstehen und darauf zu reagieren.Allerdings nutzen viele Unternehmen KI nur in begrenzten Bereichen. Eine erfolgreiche Integration von KI in den Industrieprozess erfordert einen interdisziplinären Austausch zwischen verschiedenen Parteien und kann mit Aufwand verbunden sein. Um die Vorteile von KI optimal zu nutzen, sollten Unternehmen nicht nur ihre Fähigkeit zur Datensammlung und -haltung einsetzen, sondern auch den Austausch zwischen Datenerzeugern und -nutzern fördern (Data Mesh). Es empfiehlt sich, KI bereits bei der Prozessentwicklung zu berücksichtigen und wenn möglich zu integrieren, um ihre zukünftige Einbindung zu erleichtern. Ein nachträgliches Hinzufügen von KI kann hingegen zu erhöhter Komplexität führen - ""Man muss das Eisen schmieden, solange es heiß ist"".",-0.1779,0.0,0,7,0

Marwa Khost Jarkas,15-03-2023,"Last year, I was approached byWIREDfor a feature related to what Tech companies are doing to ensure the Arabic language becomes more universally gender neutral.It is a BIG question for sure, as there is so much to do in that field. Arabic is a gendered language, similar to many other languages including, but not limited to, Hindi, Hebrew, French, German, Spanish, etc. For many of those gendered languages, masculine nouns and pronouns have been often used with a generic function to refer to both men and women. This being said, all languages evolve with time and the Arabic language has the appropriate means to be an inclusive language. It is on the speakers and users of the language, as well as, other responsible players (including tech companies, academic organizations, language councils etc) to take part in the evolution of the language to meet the changing needs and development of the society.Here is a quick snippet from the article.Google says it respects diversity, equality, inclusion, and integrity and encourages the expression of these values through inclusive language in its content. For Arabic, as well as other languages (particularly gendered ones), Google uses gender-neutral alternatives, enumerates both forms instead of defaulting to the universal masculine form, and feminizes job titles functions, and grades where applicable. Google Assistant also understands up to 19 colloquial Arabic languages and responds in gender-neutral Modern Standard Arabic.“We have clear inclusive language guidelines and we’re continuously trying to implement them in as many products and content types as possible,” says Marwa Khost Jarkas, communications manager at Google MENA. “Inclusive language is the language that avoids the use of expressions or words that might be considered to exclude or offend particular groups of people. In other words, it is meant to be a respectful language that is devoid of biases, stereotypes, and potentially offensive, triggering, or exclusionary language.”ThanksIain Akermanfor this opportunity and for raising this topic.What are your thoughts?EN:https://lnkd.in/dyAdJmVCAR:https://shortest.link/kxns",0.9799,0.3360670194003526,0,35,0

Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt.

Fortunatos - In-House Marketing Agency,15-03-2023,"🙄 Why did Google abandon AI two years ago?Two years ago, developers Daniel De Freitas and Noam Shazir developed the most powerful chatbot at the time. However, Google management denied them access to the chatbot to other researchers, an attempt to integrate it into the virtual assistant Google Assistant, and a public demonstration.The company argued its position that the program does not meet the standards for the safety and fairness of the AI system.The developers left Google in 2021 and are developing their ownCharacter.Aiproject.After the release of ChatGPT, Google did return to the idea of its own chatbot, partially based on the technology developed by De Freitas and Shazir.

Letícia Tainara Souza,15-03-2023,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, histórico de tendências e evoluções, aqui vão algumas das tendências de marketing para 2023:🤳🏻 Marketing de influência: o marketing de influência chegou pra ficar e continuará a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conteúdo para alcançar públicos específicos (Ó a base da Virginia aí, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).🎁 Personalização: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experiência personalizada e relevante, e as empresas estão investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estratégias para atender a essa demanda.📼 Vídeo marketing: o vídeo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produção de vídeo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Então investe nisso. A era dos estáticos morreu).🔊 Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas estão começando a adotar estratégias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personalização também).📩 Marketing de conteúdo: este continuará a desempenhando um papel importante na construção de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom! Se você é um profissional da área, sugiro começar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estratégias e tomadas de decisão.
