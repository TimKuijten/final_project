              Smitcher            ,"I think the recent shoot in popularity of the DALL-E and Chat GPT bots are just the beginning. The appearance of AI in the public consciousness, to this degree, has happened incredibly fast. Advances will only get better. This will be the new fad for a long time--because it's hard not to think of new uses for these things. The most used tools in the world, soon enough....",0.6249,0.4788567493112947,17-12-2022,17,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs
              Jensen Raylight            ,"what people didn't know is that, Dall-e and ChatGpt already targeting the most hardest problem.
which is generating Arts from scratch, and writing Code.

everything else is a child play, because AI already solves the hardest problem and everything
other than that is super Easy.
there will be no exception, All jobs will be disrupted

in the future, there will be hundreds of different AI specialized in one specific problem,
so that if the AI makes an error, there will be other AI work on fact checking and fixing the issue, 
then there will be an AI Auditing the overall product produced by the other AI.

all of the combination above will guarantee AI to be able to do all Human Jobs
with amazing precision and they can produce Millions of things in Millisecond.

AI will rewrite history, our language,
and we won't be able to understand them anymore.
they will rewrite their own program Thousands time a second, and we won't be able to decipher anything at all.
we will lose control

does our existence still have a meaning when we are bombarded by Billions of new things everyday?
our Action loses its impact, we're insignificant",-0.4828,0.4183884297520661,17-12-2022,3,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

For those who don’t keep a track of the A.I. field, what is commercialized is usually 18 months to two years behind in the current research.
Keep in mind, the A.I. only uses the information it has been trained on, if in this case the Eastern Orthodox view of Christian theology had been used as input what kind of images would have been generated?
Also art A.I. still have trouble with general human features though some like DALL-E 2 can produce photorealistic renderings, that’s a question to ask, generate a photorealistic image of Jesus from all available descriptions.

A.I. is a reflection of what we feed into it, the cautionary tale is not to anthropomorphize the inanimate.

While I agree that a lot of issues raised in this video are serious concerns, as a visual artist myself, the absolute best thing about dall-e 2 is its ability to produce alternatives of my own work based on image uploads. The outputs are always high quality and surprising in what they tease out of my  work. This helps me think beyond my own limits. Like AI text generators which, based on prompts, come up with nonsense (but sometimes extremely beautifully poetic nonsense), even these early examples can be incredibly useful tools for creative people in brainstorming, seeing their own bad habits, seeing how their work may be interpreted by an inherently naïve audience, etc. In other words, we've been imaging AI for decades as robotic and binary and drudgingly predictable, but what we're actually seeing now is a kind of joyful spontaneity.",0.9382,0.5724166666666666,17-08-2022,10,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVcsDDABEkM

              Richard Levy            ,"As a university researcher in VR and computer visualization, Dall-E2 will certainly open up exciting new opportunities.  But for someone who has taught at the college level for over 40 years, I also know that in the hands of my students,  AI applications like Dall-E2 and Chapt GPT will be used to reduce the time spent on the act of producing a work of art or writing an essay.  Each term I grade hundreds of essays.  How will I know if the work they submit was the product of AI?  Though ChatGPT creates the same output from the same input terms. However, by varying the input terms slightly you can produce a different essay. My experimentation with ChatGPT has produced essays that are better written than 90% of what is submitted during the term.  For those students in the visual arts, Dall-E2 can create numerous permutations from a single set of keywords.  Most of the experiments have produced works of art that I know my students could never create. For those college students who look for the easy way out, the use of these tools will result in little learning over their tenure in college. It is true that in the past students plagiarized the work of others.
