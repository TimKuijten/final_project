Swapnil Amin,15-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0
David J. Wilson,14-03-2023,"Good morning! Are you interested in learning more about 2023’s most talked-about technology? 🧐Yes, I'm talking about the exciting world of generative AI, and its potential to transform industries and create new forms of content. Look at my first comment a link to this complete article byMcKinsey & Company, which explains the basics of#generativeaiand its many practical applications.Let me highlight here some key points:➡ Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulation, and even videos. In the category of machine learning, it generates all kinds of new content, such as articles where the grammar is perfect, the tone works, and the narrative flows, or music and art that really make sense.➡#chatgpt—the GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer—it’s a free chatbot that can generate an answer to almost any question it’s asked. And DALL-E is a tool for AI-generated art. ChatGPT is being developed by a team of researchers and engineers at OpenAI, a research organization dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence in a safe and beneficial manner, ChatGPT was first announced and made available to developers in June 2020, and then released for testing to the public on November 30, 2022. As you can see in the image byInsider Intelligence, over a million people signed up to use it in just five days, a new record for user acquisition (Source:Data.ai). Computer code, essays, poems, and even jokes, are examples of what fans have posted while interacting with this chatbot (me included).➡ AI is the practice of getting machines to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks. For instance, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are based on AI technology. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence. Through ML, practitioners develop AI through models that can “learn” from data patterns without human direction. The huge volume and complexity of data have increased the potential for machine learning, as well as the need for it.➡ Machine learning is founded on several building blocks, as our way of transforming your business model atCeibo Digital, starting with classical statistical techniques developed between the 18th and 20th centuries for small data sets. In the 1930s and 1940s, computer pioneers such as Alan Turing began working on the basic techniques for machine learning. Does anyone remember the Turing Machine?➡ Until recently, machine learning was largely limited to predictive models, used to observe, and classify patterns in content. Generative AI was a breakthrough. Instead of perceiving and classifying a photo, machine learning is now able to create an image or text description on its own.Generative AI has the power to transform the way we live and work, and ChatGPT is just one example of the incredible possibilities it offers.

The new study marks the first time an AI algorithm called Stable Diffusion, developed by a German group and publicly released in 2022, has been used to do this. Stable Diffusion is similar to other text-to-image “generative” AIs such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, which produce new images from text prompts after being trained on billions of images associated with text descriptions.Unlike previous efforts using AI algorithms to decipher brain scans, which had to be trained on large data sets, Stable Diffusion was able to get more out of less training for each participant by incorporating photo captions into the algorithm. It’s a novel approach that incorporates textual and visual information to “decipher the brain,” says Ariel Goldstein, a cognitive neuroscientist at Princeton University who was not involved with the work.",0.891,0.3140692640692641,0,0,0

Il nome DALL-E deriva dalla combinazione dei nomi dell'artista surrealista Salvador Dalì e del personaggio animato Pixar Wall-E.Il funzionamento di DALL-E è basato su una tecnica di apprendimento profondo chiamata ""generative adversarial network"" (GAN), in cui due reti neurali si ""sfidano"" a creare contenuti: una rete genera le immagini e l'altra le valuta e le confronta con quelle reali, cercando di individuare le differenze e le somiglianze.

Mukesh Manral🇮🇳,15-03-2023,"🔴 Timeline view of different deep learning approaches in Natural Language Processing that have been developed to improve this field:👉  2014: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber. LSTMs address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs and enable the network to retain long-term dependencies in the input sequence.👉  2014: Google introduces the Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) system, which uses a combination of deep learning approaches, including LSTMs, to improve machine translation accuracy.👉  2015: Attention Mechanism👉  2016: CNNs are applied to natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and sentiment analysis. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.👉  2017: Transfer learning becomes popular in natural language processing, allowing pre-trained models to be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Examples of this approach include the OpenAI language model GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) introduced by Google.👉  2018: Transformer model is introduced by Vaswani et al. Uses self-attention instead of RNNs to process input sequences, resulting in faster training and better performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.👉  2019: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are applied to text generation and style transfer. This approach allows the model to learn the underlying structure of the input data and generate new data that is similar to the training data.👉  2020: Pre-trained language models such as GPT-3, introduced by OpenAI, achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks, and are used as a starting point for further fine-tuning on specific tasks.👉  GPT-3 (2020): This language model, developed by OpenAI, achieved state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing tasks, including language generation, question-answering, and language translation.👉  CLIP (2021): Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training model developed by OpenAI, which is capable of learning representations of both images and text in a joint space.👉 DALL-E (2021): model that generates images from textual descriptions using a combination of transformers and a generative adversarial network (GAN).👉MLP-Mixer (2021): new architecture for image classification, which uses only multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and no convolutional layers.👉 Perceiver (2021): new architecture for image recognition, which uses a combination of transformers and MLPs to process input data.👉 Swin Transformer (2021): new transformer-based architecture for object detection in images, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.👉 SETR (2021): another transformer-based architecture for image segmentation, which achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.",0.9531,0.3869146005509643,0,0,0

Sekura Mobile Intelligence,15-03-2023,"GPT-4 is a game-changer for our industry -Gautam Hazari,Sekura Mobile IntelligenceChief Technology Officer reviews yesterday's live demo and foregrounds what is going to be a step-change for identity and security...""There are 2 key features in GPT-4 which are mind-blowing: it can process images. In the live demo today, a hand-drawn note for a web page was photographed with a phone camera and was fed into a GPT-4 trained model, which GPT-4 interpreted as a requirement to create a website - and it did just that!It created a functioning website, with the look and feel of the hand-written diagram on the page of a notebook. So, going forward, text-based inputs are not going to create any limitations; it can be images and hand-written notes, combined with text if needed.It can process very large documents - from various domains, including legal, contractual and even tax-related documents. In the live demo, GPT-4 came up with tax return calculations based on the tax regulations and even provided explanations referring to the sections of the tax laws. So, contract red-lining can be done by GPT-4 much more efficiently and within minutes.The implications to our industry will be many, here are just some:‣ Sophisticated account takeover frauds: GPT-4 can be trained using the reinforced learning methods (basically complementing the already trained model with additional specific details), by feeding handwritten notes, letters, electronic communications etc.‣ Personalised and realistic phishing messages: Re-trained GPT-4 model can generate phishing messages which will look like coming from known and genuine sources‣ New creative attack vectors: This is an outcome of Generative AI - including GPT-4 and DALL-E/DALL-E 2, which will create new attack vectors, including Synthetic ID attacks and beyond. GPT-4 can be trained to write code to automate those attacks and even personalise the attacks to industrialise targeted attack vectors.""Thanks, Gautam. Clearly, we will need robust methods of preventing new attack vectors; Sekura's API focuses on the SIM as a true possession factor using 66 separate potential fraud signals providing extremely strong fraud detection coupled with an awesome UX for the user.The SAFr framework continues to develop in line with AI & ML advances too.

It can’t however generate images (like Dall-E).- GPT-4 scored around the top 10% in bar exams across different fields (medicine, biology, physics, math, economics, chemistry etc), in comparison, GPT 3.5 was in the bottom 10%.- It performs better in other languages (including Swahili) than even other large language models perform in English.- GPT-4 still has issues with hallucinations (spouting overconfident bs), however it performed 40% better than GPT-3.5 on tests that evaluate ability to stay factually accurate.- Bing was already using GPT-4 (without the image part). You have to join a waiting list to get access (without the image part at the moment) as developer or AI (ethics) researcher. For GPT Plus subscribers, it’s coming soon.- They are for some reason hiding the size of GPT-4 (number of parameters). They say it’s because of competition.- Of course the 100 trillion parameter post that claimed it can write songs blah blah was fake news.

It involves defining the context, setting goals, selecting relevant datasets, and fine-tuning parameters to optimize the output. Basically, you manipulate what a Large Language Model does, instead of training your own (which is costly, believe me).Is there a demand for prompt engineers? 🤔#AIis currently a very hot topic, so it’s only natural that individuals who can make the most of AI tools are much in demand.

Egy pillanatra a kis robot szüleinek érezzük magunk, akik bemutatják a szomszédnak a tehetséges gyermekük. Ahhoz hasonlítható büszke érzés, mint Karikó Katalinnak díjat átadni, vele fényképezkedni. A rivaldafényből pici sugár nekünk is jut, mi is átlényegülünk közben.Beállok hát én is a boldog-boldogtalanok sorába, és megosztom én is gondolataim!1. Mivel nincs személyes véleménye, és nem érzelmei irányítják, emiatt a beszélgetések folyamán kizárólag az adatokra támaszkodik.Wow, LEAN szemlélete van!Nem mondom, hogy arra a világra vágyom, hogy minden kollegám Chat GPT üzemmódba váltson, de néha segítene, ha tudnánk mindannyian váltogatni: meeting kicsit „AI” alapú, utána a kávézás inkább ember alapú.2. Egy egyetemi oktató ismerősöm mesélte, náluk az a megoldás várható, az írásbeliken nem tiltják meg a használatát, hanem az esszékbe integrálni kell a Chat GPT által összegyűjtött információkat, és azokat is véleményezni kell.Vow, egy fura, érzelem nélküli robot ösztönöz bennünket arra, hogy jobban támaszkodjunk érzelmeinkre és kreativitásunkra!3. Növelni kell a szóbeli vizsgák arányát, mivel ott kiderül az igazság, ki mit tud.Vow, a mesterséges intelligencia kényszeríti rá az emberiséget, hogy személyesebb kapcsolatot ápoljanak egymással, az oktatók és diákok többet beszélgessenek egymással.Ez az algoritmus az évszázad nagy tanítómestere, ha rajtam múlna, ő lenne az Év embere a Time magazin következő borítóján.Fruzsi lányomnak felolvastam a hvg Portré rovatában a vele készített interjút, egyik válasza különösen tetszett:„Olyan vagyok, mint egy szuperokos, de a társaságban esetlenül mozgó okostojás, akinek az intelligenciáját a haverjai-egy csomó lármás partiarc-folyvást játékos kérdésekkel tesztelik.

Cash flow (and working capital) issues are often just a symptom of more significant underlying ‘upstream’ problems that must be addressed.These are 10 of the most common root causes of financial problems in consultancies I am observing all the time:𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝟯 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗵 𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀1. Inefficient billing and collections: by far the #1 cash flow killer in consulting, it can screw up a consultancy big time;2. Scope creep: the silent killer of consultancy profitability and cash flow, definitely the #2 ‘upstream problem’ in consulting;3. Price it right: not charging competitive rates that reflect the value of the expertise, the #3 cash flow ‘eater’ in consulting;𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗴4. Underutilized team: if the consultancy's team isn't being utilized to its full potential, it’s leaving money on the table;5. Flying blind: the danger of running a consultancy with unreliable pipeline forecasting (I wrote a post about it yesterday);6. Overreliance on one client: a ticking time bomb. Diversify the client base to avoid a financial crash when the biggest client disappears;7. Inadequate cash reserves: a recipe for disaster, consultancies need at least 3 to 6 months of working capital;8. One-trick ponies: the danger of poor service offering design in consultancies, not targeted at retaining a client over a long period;9. Unnecessary expenses: inefficient expenses and cost management can drain the cash flow;10. Seasonality: don't let seasonality take you by surprise, the months of December, January, July, and August are quiet months in consulting.👉 HERE’S MY ADVICEIf you're experiencing cash flow (and/or working capital) issues in your consultancy, looking beyond the obvious reasons and considering all the possible root causes is essential.Go ‘upstream’...Remember that cash flow is not just about money coming in and going out, it's all about how you manage your consulting business.

Denis Rothman,15-03-2023,"GPT-4 is now here. I've read so many ridiculous assumptions about the model, that I decided to ask ChatGPT to summarize the transcript of yesterday's live session hosted by Greg Brockman, President and Co-Founder of OpenAI.First, let's see what Greg Brockman had to say and then I'll make 2 comments for you to think about. The links to the resources in this post are in the comment section.▶️ ChatGPT's summary of Greg Brockman's presentation:""On March 14th, Greg Brockman, President and Co-Founder of OpenAI discussed a developer demo of GPT-4 and its capabilities/limitations. The demo showcases GPT-4's ability to perform various tasks, such as summarizing articles into sentences and turning blog posts into rhyming poems. The model is steerable and can adhere to any instruction given to it. The demo also highlights the creation of a Discord bot using GPT-4 as an AI programming assistant to write code in pseudocode and break down problems into smaller pieces. The model's training cutoff is in 2021, which limits its ability to recognize new chat completion formats. Nonetheless, the model is flexible and can be applied to various problems and applications. The text also indicates that the model is highly flexible and can handle a variety of inputs, including code, language, and text, suggesting that it may be capable of processing images in some form, although the exact extent of this capability is not clear from the given information.""▶️ My 2 comments:1. GPT-4 is an incremental evolution of GPT-3.5 turbo(ChatGPT) that will have better ""steering"" flexibility and multimodal capability. It's a good step forward but not a revolution. There is still a lot of work to do such as helping OpenAI by evaluating and providing feedback.2.. DALL-E, Vit, and CLIP are already ""first generation"" multimodal transformers as shown in the image below which is an excerpt from Transformers for NLP, 2nd Edition, Chapter 15, in which I explain the theory of these models and provide notebooks.🔴 Bottom line: For those who understand the architecture of transformer models and are implementing GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4 is an incremental evolution. However, for those who have not kept up with the theory and practice of transformers, GPT-4 is a quantum leap to get up to speed. Some compensate for their lack of knowledge with fantasmagorical hype. This creates the huge gap we can see on social media between science and fiction. Ignore the hype, stick to the science, and get to work on transformers asap!#ai#science#gpt4#chatgpt",0.6918,0.4608383838383839,7 ,45,4

Der Golden Circle ist ein Konzept, das von Sinek in seinem Buch ""Start with Why"" eingeführt wurde. Es ist ein Framework, das Unternehmen dabei hilft, ihre Mission und ihr Warum (Why) zu identifizieren und zu kommunizieren.👨‍💻  Ich: Wäre die richtige Übersetzung von Why in dem Zusammenhang nicht eher Wozu oder Wofür?🤖  ChatGPT: Ja, du hast recht, die Übersetzung von ""Why"" im Zusammenhang mit dem Golden Circle kann je nach Kontext auch mit ""Wozu"" oder ""Wofür"" übersetzt werden. Im deutschen Kontext kann das Wort ""Warum"" jedoch auch passend sein, da es oft als Synonym für ""Wozu"" oder ""Wofür"" verwendet wird und sich auf den Zweck oder die Motivation hinter einer Handlung oder Entscheidung bezieht.In der Tat betont Sinek, dass das ""Why"" im Golden Circle sich auf das ""purpose"" bezieht, was in diesem Zusammenhang mit ""Zweck"" oder ""Sinn"" übersetzt werden kann. Der Fokus liegt darauf, warum ein Unternehmen, eine Person oder eine Organisation das tut, was sie tut, und nicht nur darauf, was sie tun oder wie sie es tun.👨‍💻  Ich: Naja, auch wenn es in Deutschland einfach falsch übersetzt wird, hat das Konzept eine sehr starke Wirkung und ich bin davon überzeugt, dass wir die Welt besser machen, wenn wir mehr über  unsere Überzeugungen sprechen und weniger darüber, wie wir es oder was wir machen.🤖  ChatGPT: Ja, da gebe ich dir vollkommen recht. Das Konzept des Golden Circle ist unabhängig von der Übersetzung sehr wirkungsvoll und kann dazu beitragen, dass Menschen und Organisationen ihre Überzeugungen und Werte besser verstehen und effektiver kommunizieren. Indem wir uns auf unser ""Why"" oder unseren Zweck konzentrieren, können wir uns motivieren, unsere Ziele zu erreichen und einen sinnvollen Beitrag zu leisten.👨‍💻 Ich: Wir brauchen vielleicht bald keine Freunde mehr, mit denen wir uns über solche Themen unterhalten. Und doch ist es wichtig, dass wir unserer Überzeugung treu bleiben und nicht auf alles hören, das uns irgendwer vorkaut und wir dann einfach schlucken. Wenn wir immer nach dem Warum fragen (also nach der Ursache) hängen wir in der Vergangenheit und finden Ausreden (warum -> weil versus wozu -> damit). Es geht darum, dass wir selbst denken und unsere eigenen Fehler und Erfahrungen machen.Warum stehst du jeden Tag auf? Weil der Wecker klingelt.Wofür stehst du jeden Tag auf?

"Manuel Parra Palacios, MSc PMP",15-03-2023,"Ayer martes se anunció el nuevo modelo de lenguaje GPT-4 de OpenAI, un modelo de inteligencia artificial que asegura ser el más avanzado del mundo.GPT-4 tiene 15 veces más parámetros que su predecesor, GPT-3, y es capaz de completar tareas complejas de lenguaje natural con una precisión impresionante. Una de las principales innovaciones de GPT-4 es su capacidad para generar textos coherentes y convincentes a partir de solo un fragmento de texto de entrada. Además, GPT-4 puede crear texto que parece haber sido escrito por humanos, lo que lo hace muy útil para diversas aplicaciones.La capacidad de GPT-4 para entender y producir lenguaje natural se basa en un enfoque de aprendizaje automático conocido como ""aprendizaje profundo"". A través del aprendizaje profundo, GPT-4 puede analizar enormes cantidades de datos de lenguaje natural y aprender patrones en el idioma. Esto permite a GPT-4 generar texto que suena natural y coherente, incluso en contextos complejos.GPT-4 también puede generar respuestas a preguntas complejas, completar oraciones y crear resúmenes precisos de textos largos. Otra de las aplicaciones potenciales de GPT-4 es la creación de contenido para medios de comunicación y marketing. Por ejemplo, GPT-4 puede generar títulos de artículos, subtítulos y descripciones que atraen al público y aumentan la visibilidad del contenido.GPT-4 también tiene la capacidad de traducir texto de un idioma a otro con una precisión impresionante. Esto podría tener un gran impacto en la comunicación global y en la eliminación de barreras lingüísticas.Sin embargo, también hay preocupaciones sobre el potencial de GPT-4 para generar contenido engañoso o manipulado.OpenAI está trabajando en medidas para evitar el uso indebido de GPT-4 y garantizar que se utilice de manera ética y responsable.#ChatGPT#IAFuente: ""OpenAI releases GPT-4, a multimodal AI that it claims is state-of-the-art"".

Kate Xie,15-03-2023,"Can AI make better art than humans? It's an interesting questionArtificial intelligence has been infiltrating every industry and the world of arts and culture is no exception. In other words, AI art is poised to explode.AI text-to-image generators such as DALL-E or Midjourney have been creating remarkable visual artworks. ChatGPT has taken the world by the storm with its ability to answer questions, write essays, and summarize texts, among other things. AI-generated art is even being displayed at world-renowned museums.These examples show just how powerful generative AI can be and bid this pressing question: is AI about to replace human artists? It is a question worth thinking about.Seth Dobrin, IBM's first-ever Global Chief AI Officer, has an answer.AI-generated visual art already exists in various forms. There are examples of artists — such as Refik Anadol — who are the actual creators, but use artificial intelligence to augment their artworks. There are also tools like DALL-E which “are getting there,” although it's difficult to say whether their works are truly indistinguishable from humans'.Dobrin has a similar view on news articles, noting that financial news is already being automatically generated to an extent. And while he doesn't believe that AI-generated text is as engaging as a writer's would be, he explained that GPT-3 and Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate stories that journalists can use as a starting point.But when it comes to movies and novels, AI has a longer way to go. That's because “AI needs to truly learn emotion, really be able to simulate it, and invoke empathy — better than it can today,” Dobrin said. He expects five more years for novel creation, and between five to 10 years for movie production.But what's Dobrin's prediction on classical music? And does he believe that AI will merely augment humans in the creative process — or eventually replace them?You can watch the full interview to find out.#AIintelligence#AI#ChatGPT#artificialintelligence#OracleTranslation#manualtranslation#languagetranslation",0.9907,0.4346059113300492,0,0,0

Es dauerte nie lange, bis jemand mit einem breiten Grinsen verkündete, dass irgendein Superstar oder Politiker bestimmt albanische Wurzeln hatte. In meiner wilden Jugendzeit war das “Who is Who” der albanischen Berühmtheiten noch recht überschaubar.🇦🇱Doch die heutige 2. und 3. Generation der in der Diaspora lebenden Albaner und Albanerinnen erlebt eine regelrechte Explosion an internationalen Stars und Erfolgen! Egal ob Fußballprofis wie Granit Xhaka und Xherdan Shaqiri oder Pop-Ikonen wie Dua Lipa, Bebe Rexha und Rita Ora – sie alle sorgen dafür, dass die albanischen Jugendlichen vor Stolz platzen und die ein oder andere Gesangseinlage oder sportliche Kür einlegen möchten.Aber Moment mal, es gibt noch mehr! Die jüngeren Generationen entdecken ganz neue Vorbilder, die über Sport und Musik hinausgehen.

Florian Groening,15-03-2023,"Viele große Unternehmen sind längst „in der Cloud“. Für viele kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMUs) stellt sich jedoch nach wie vor die Frage: Macht das für mich Sinn?Die Antwort kann man ausnahmsweise mal sehr klar formulieren: Ja!Warum genau sollte man denn so unbedingt „in die Cloud“? In Gesprächen mit KMUs höre ich häufig eine aus meiner Sicht falsche Motivation/Hoffnung: Um Geld zu sparen! Das ist aber in den meisten Fällen gar nicht so gegeben – zumindest nicht kurzfristig.Was hingegen aber unbedingt für die Cloud spricht:🚨Sicherheit! Sehr viele Unternehmen – auch die KMUs - sind schon Opfer von Cyber Angriffen geworden, teilweise mit dramatischen Folgen bis hin zur Insolvenz. Experten gehen davon aus, dass im Laufe der Zeit jedes (!) Unternehmen Opfer wird. Eine Auslagerung von kritischen Geschäftsprozessen in die Cloud erhöht signifikant die Chancen, auch bei Cyberangriffen „betriebsbereit“ zu bleiben bzw. schnell wieder zu werden. Früher hatte man eher Bedenken, ob „meine Daten“ in der Cloud sicher seien – heute muss man anerkennen, dass tausende von Sicherheitsexperten bei Cloudanbietern ihr Kerngeschäft besser absichern können, als ein KMU dies jemals mit seinen Ressourcen tun könnte!📱Mobilität und Flexibilität! Die Verlagerung möglichst vieler Geschäftsprozesse und Daten in die Cloud ermöglich erst, dass man flexibel von überall auf der Welt (oder auch nur im Außendienst 250km entfernt) „wie im Büro“ sicher arbeiten kann. Und manchmal sogar besser als vorher (z.B. gleichzeitig im selben Dokument). Kombiniert mit Kommunikationslösungen, wie z.B. MS TEAMs, kann man zudem auch mit den Kunden und seinen Teams „unterwegs“ nahtlos im Kontakt bleiben.Somit entsteht einerseits ein ganz anderes Flexibilitätsniveau, um auch mit besonderen Situationen umzugehen (à la: „Alle ins Homeoffice, wir haben eine Pandemie“). Es wächst vor allem aber auch die Attraktivität des Unternehmens für Arbeitnehmer - und um die muss in den nächsten Jahren immer härter „gekämpft“ werden!🚀 Weil man es heute endlich kann! Viele Standardprozesse des Büroalltags lassen sich inzwischen über Standard-Cloud-Lösungen / Software as a Servcie SaaS (wie z.B. Microsoft 365/Azure oder Google) effizient auslagern, sodass man „auf Augenhöhe“ mit Konzernen operieren kann, ohne eine eigene IT-Abteilung zu unterhalten.Insofern kann man zusammenfassend festhalten: wenn man einen Cyber Angriff schneller und ohne Lösegeldzahlungen überstanden hat, weil man schon in der Cloud war, hat man am Ende doch sehr viel Geld gespart.Natürlich muss ein „Umzug in die Cloud“ gut geplant sein, von der technischen Umsetzung bis hin zur Anpassung der Unternehmenskultur. the future of | unterstützt hier gerne und ganzheitlich!Was denkt Ihr, macht der Umzug in die Cloud Sinn?#thefutureof#kmu#cloud#saas#cybersecurity#mobileworking#workcation(Bildquelle: durch Dall-E gerendert)",-0.9952,0.5625,0,9,1

Shoukat Hussain,15-03-2023,"Microsoft laid off an entire team dedicated to guiding AI innovation that leads to ethical, responsible and sustainable outcomes. The cutting of the ethics and society team, as reported by Platformer, is part of a recent spate of layoffs that affected 10,000 employees across the company.The elimination of the team comes as Microsoft invests billions more dollars into its partnership with OpenAI, the startup behind art- and text-generating AI systems like ChatGPT and DALL-E 2, and revamps its Bing search engine and Edge web browser to be powered by a new, next-generation large language model that is “more powerful than ChatGPT and customized specifically for search.”The move calls into question Microsoft’s commitment to ensuring its product design and AI principles are closely intertwined at a time when the company is making its controversial AI tools available to the mainstream.Microsoft still maintains its Office of Responsible AI (ORA), which sets rules for responsible AI through governance and public policy work. But employees told Platformer that the ethics and society team was responsible for ensuring Microsoft’s responsible AI principles are actually reflected in the design of products that ship. The team had been recently working to identify risks posed by Microsoft’s integration of OpenAI’s technology across its suite of products.The ethics and society team wasn’t very large — only about seven people remained after a reorganization in October. Sources who spoke with Platformer said pressure from the chief technology officer Kevin Scott and CEO Satya Nadella was mounting to get the most recent OpenAI models, as well as next iterations, into customers’ hands as quickly as possible.Last year, the reorganization saw most of the ethics and society team transferred to other teams. On March 6, John Montgomery, corporate vice president of AI, told the remaining members that they’d be eliminated after all. Members of the team told Platformer they believed they were let go because Microsoft had become more focused on getting its AI products shipped before the competition, and was less concerned with long-term, socially responsible thinking.Teams like Microsoft’s ethics and society department often pull the reins on big tech organizations by pointing out potential societal consequences or legal ramifications. Microsoft perhaps didn’t want to hear “No,” anymore as it became hell bent on taking market share away from Google’s search engine. The company said every 1% of market share it could pry from Google would result in $2 billion in annual revenue.V-ART SERVICES PVT LTDVector ArtRohit JaiswalKafil Baloch",0.9754,0.4735312306740879,0,1,0

Bastien Villebrun,15-03-2023,"#citylabNYC Is Looking for Its Next Artificial Intelligence CzarThe position would find new use cases for AI and machine learning at city departments and create policy to ensure tools are used responsibly.With programs like ChatGPT and Dall-E going mainstream,#NewYorkCityis looking for a director of#ArtificialIntelligenceand#MachineLearningto shape how emerging tools are used in everything from policing to#urbanplanning.The newly defined role under the city’s Office of Technology and Innovation, with a salary range of $75,000 to $140,000, will be tasked with finding new#AIuse cases, educating the public and city departments about upsides and risks, and informing and guiding the city’s overarching AI and machine learning policies.“Part of this new director's job will be to do collaborative work with agencies to better identify where AI can be used, and where there are resources that could be brought to bear to help support agency use of AI machine learning,” saidAlex Foard, the executive director for Research & Collaboration for NYC’s Office of Technology and Innovation. Another major goal, he said, is to “create policies and guardrails for agencies that allow them to be able to use those tools responsibly.”New York City for years has used algorithms to match students with public schools, to power police technologies like gunshot detection tools, and even to target homelessness prevention resources. In many instances, they have learned to proceed with caution. There are several ethical considerations raised by the application of AI, including#privacyconcerns and questions of bias that can have disproportionate impacts on people of color or women when applied to criminal justice or hiring decisions.The position of AI director isn’t an entirely new one for New York. In 2019, under then-Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, New York City hired Neal Parikh, a start-up founder who got his PhD in machine learning from Stanford University, to run artificial intelligence strategy, a role that was then under the Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer.“The idea was, essentially, we can't really write these AI policies governing the city's own use of this without understanding what is even out there,” Parikh recalled.His main priority then was shaping New York City’s#AIstrategy, with a document that laid out the city’s philosophy of#digitalrightsand the areas of opportunity for using artificial intelligence and machine learning within city government. Doing this work within the structure of government was sometimes challenging, he said.“The diversity of tasks is a great challenge in doing something like AI policy, because it's not a one-size-fits-all thing. It's often very context-based,” said Parikh. “It's a much harder job than being an AI ethics researcher, I'll tell you that.”Prior AI-focused initiatives, like a task force convened in 2017 to shape algorithmic policy, have run into...",0.9923,0.4699320794148379,2 ,1,0

James Craddock,15-03-2023,"Morning! Over the last couple of months, I've been talking a lot about#AIand#ChatGPT. Last night there was a major#updatemoving from GPT 3.5 to GPT 4.ChatGPT 4 is available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers at $20 per month and is currently restricted to 100 messages in a 4-hour period.ChatGPT 4 will beable to:✔Understand images - eg: writing captions for images or interpreting them and picking out ingredients and suggesting recipes.✔It is capable of handling up to 25,000 words in a single request - about 6 times that of the previous version.✔It has advanced reasoning capabilities✔It's safer, less likely to respond with disallowed content and is more likely to produce factual responses than its predecessor.So I thought I'd interview ChatGPT 4 and ask it what the differences are between ChatGPT 3.5 vs 4.It had many ideas, but they were all hypothetical as it didn't realise that the upgrade had taken place and it was now running on a new version....However, I did get an insight as to how it wanted to be seen by the LinkedIn community. I asked it:❓Please write me instructions for Dall-E-2 to draw me a picture to go with your LinkedIn interview that you feel best represents you.Its response: 🗣 ""Create an illustration featuring a friendly and professional AI language model, ChatGPT, being interviewed for a LinkedIn post. The scene should depict a virtual environment with ChatGPT represented as an advanced, sleek, and modern chatbot or hologram. Include a laptop or computer screen displaying the ongoing interview conversation""Dall-E-2 is an AI image generation tool 📷 created by#OpenAithe company behind ChatGPT - the image used on this post was generated by Dall-E-2 using the text prompt above. So one could say, this is how ChatGPT sees itself...But when questioned, ChatGPT 4 says: 📢 ""As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or self-perception in the way humans do. My purpose is to assist users with their questions and provide information based on the data I've been trained on.""My conclusion, ChatGPT 4 is not the best interview subject or indeed an expert on what the new version of this ground-breaking AI is capable of.I guess I'm just going to have to start using it to see what all the fuss is about. But don't worry I will share my findings.Have you started to use ChatGPT yet?

Michael Sean O'Brien,15-03-2023,"Generative AI (Dall-E, Chat-GPT, etc) is very important, interesting, and impressive. As Artificial Intelligence, however, it is also extremely limited and—worse—impossible to predict in its behavior. It *mimics* intelligence in specific (and undoubtedly useful) situations, but it cannot reason, and it has no capability for abstraction. It cannot be relied upon to solve even simple logic puzzles and “story problems”. It cannot solve problems at all except where it has many many examples to hand of similar problems laid it out in exhaustive imagery or text, and even then it regularly gets basic things wrong. The problem is not that its manner of learning is not yet perfected. The problem is that it *only* learns. It neither reasons nor abstracts learning to create or apply understanding. And the authors of these technologies are not by and large working to add these capabilities to their creations. They have their hammer — deep learning — and they will find their nails. We need more tools in our toolbox, if we are to make AI not just more proficient, but more reliable, governable, and most of all safe.

Mid Journey's output is particularly impressive when it comes to generating complex structures with many layers and details.DALL-E 2: This tool is a natural language processing (NLP) model that can generate images based on textual prompts. For the architecture visualization prompt, DALL-E 2 could generate a wide variety of images, ranging from abstract representations of buildings to more realistic depictions. DALL-E 2's output tends to be more creative and imaginative, as it can generate images that are not necessarily based on realistic architecture.NightCafe: This tool is an AI-based image generator that can create unique and realistic images based on textual prompts.

MIT Machine Intelligence for Manufacturing and Operations,15-03-2023,"It’s impossible to overstate the excitement that currently surrounds the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From generative AI breakthroughs like ChatGPT and DALL-E to advancements in autonomy, enthusiasm about machine intelligence is spreading beyond computer science circles and entering the mainstream market, prompting industry leaders to ask how this technology can be useful to them. Current trends show that AI could augment a workforce, speed up decision-making, improve pipelines, and automate mundane tasks. But there are complex considerations when weighing AI solutions such as sustainability concerns, cost, and limitations. AI adopters also want to be sure that they’re staying up to date with the latest innovations, maximizing the impact of use cases and remaining competitive as this evolving field continues to change.One way to see beyond the horizon in machine intelligence is to understand what’s happening at research institutions like MIT. This year’s AI – Accelerate Impact: MIT MIMO Symposium—a student-led annual event that brings together industry leaders and members of the MIT community to discuss how machine learning is transforming manufacturing and operations—will focus on the current impact of AI and how it can be accelerated going forward.On May 9th, join both industry and academic speakers as they discuss how machine intelligence can increase efficiency, empower sustainability, and be applied to manufacturing and operations.The 2023 Symposium is hosted by MIT MIMO in collaboration withMIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)",0.9912,0.5427350427350427,0,5,1

Ante las primeras críticas, la compañía ha querido lanzar un comunicado donde vienen a decir que los despidos no significa que dejen de lado la responsabilidad sobre sus desarrollos.El problema es que un informe de Platformer [https://lnkd.in/eh9URh46] asegura que algunos empleados ya han expresado que era precisamente el equipo de ética y sociedad el que desempeñó un papel fundamental para garantizar esos principios de IA responsable de los que se habla en el comunicado.

Giordano B Ferreira,15-03-2023,"Você acha que uma pessoa que não saiba nada de programação conseguiria criar um jogo do zero com o auxílio do GPT4?Hoje aOpenAIrealizou o lançamento do GPT4, a nova versão do seu LLM. A demo realizada pelo presidente da OpenAI, Greg Brockman, mostrou a grande capacidade do modelo. Como já esperado, o modelo é multimodal, ou seja, receberá tanto texto quanto imagens como input e apresentará textos como output. Isso cria novos casos de uso como detalhamento de imagens, ou mesmo criação de códigos à partir de uma foto de um desenho realizado em uma folha de papel.Ainda não é possível enviar imagens para a versão pública do modelo, mas eles já disponibilizaram a interface de chat com a versão nova do modelo e eu pude testar. E, respondendo a pergunta lá do início, sim, foi possível criar um clone funcional de flappy bird em menos de 20 minutos.O que eu fiz? Pedi para o GPT4 criar um clone de flappy birds em javascript mostrando todos os arquivos necessários para que o jogo funcione. A resposta inicial foi que não seria possível apresentar o código de todo o jogo, mas já mostrou os primeiros códigos. Ao final da resposta, o modelo informou o que faltava para ter um código funcional (obstáculos, detecção de colisão, pontuação e game over). Depois disso, foi só realizar as perguntas sobre cada um dos pontos e atualizar o código.O mais legal é que todo o código gerado tem uma explicação no final. Uma ótima forma de aprender a programar.Depois disso, criei uma conta noReplituma IDE colaborativa que roda diretamente no browser. Colei o código gerado pelo GPT4. Criei um ícone no DALL-E. Cliquei em publicar e pronto. Estava com o jogo rodando no browser.Claro, para que o jogo ficasse divertido, muitas coisas ainda seriam necessárias. Mas, acredito que seria possível continuar utilizando o GPT4 para incrementar a jogabilidade.

Daniel Herrero,15-03-2023,"Hola a todos! ¿Conocen la inteligencia artificial? Es una tecnología en constante evolución y proyectos como OpenAI están liderando el camino en su desarrollo. Aunque la IA tiene el potencial de ofrecer muchos beneficios, también hay algunos riesgos asociados que debemos tener en cuenta.Las IAs del proyecto OpenAI, como GPT-4, pueden generar textos y DALL-E puede generar imágenes a partir de descripciones de texto. Aunque esto tiene muchas aplicaciones beneficiosas, también existe el riesgo de que se utilicen para difundir información falsa y engañar a la gente.Además, las IAs pueden reemplazar trabajos humanos y ser difíciles de controlar y predecir. También existe el riesgo de ser utilizadas para el control y la vigilancia, lo que puede violar la privacidad y los derechos humanos.A pesar de los riesgos, las IAs del proyecto OpenAI y similares tienen el potencial de ser increíblemente beneficiosas para la humanidad. Con la capacidad de crear texto, imágenes, sonidos y más, estas tecnologías pueden ayudarnos a avanzar en campos como la medicina, la investigación, la educación y mucho más.Es fundamental que los desarrolladores, usuarios y la sociedad en general trabajen juntos para maximizar los beneficios y minimizar los riesgos de la IA.

James Creech,15-03-2023,"ChatGPT-4 has arrived. And it's got more horsepower than Vin Diesel during a bank heist. 🏎️💨So what makes this new version better than ChatGPT-3?➊ GPT-4 can understand images. 🧑‍🎨That's right, art history class just got a lot easier.The feature is a research only preview for now, but essentially ChatGPT can accept photos, diagrams, and screenshots as prompts.Why write social media captions anymore when ChatGPT can do it for you?Not only will this enable better feedback loops for generative AI tools like DALL-E, it's a huge accessibility milestone. ChatGPT can now ""read images"" to help the blind and visually impaired.➋ GPT-4 is more accurate. 🎯The new model has broader general knowledge and increased problem solving abilities that produce 40% more accurate results than GPT-3.Which is good because if I want someone to mansplain everything on the Internet to me, I at least want the answers to be correct.➌ GPT-4 is safer. 🦺Just like Liam Neeson, the new model has a very particular set of skills that make it harder to trick or request disallowed content.➍ GPT-4 is multilingual. 🌐I guess AI spent the last 6 months studying abroad because ChatGPT now has high accuracy in 26 languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Russian.➎ GPT-4 is better at biology than you. 🔬The new model scored in the 99th percentile of the Biology Olympiad (basically the nerd olympics).Robots don't even have biology, and now they're better than us humans at that too!?What are you most excited about for ChatGPT-4?#AI#technology#chatgpt#chatgpt4#openai",0.9913,0.4528453364817001,17 ,50,5

Have you considered early retirement?""My Saturday Accountability post came and went this week as I spent the day drinking Guinness and contemplating these two statements from two separate interviews from Thursday.My whole life I have been mistaken for a woman over email. An example of this: I worked as a strategist at an agency in Portland, which had offices in New York. I would send strategy deck to the NY Strategy team for review, and their feedback redlines would be intense with very combative language. It was frustrating, and I spent a measure of effort and time providing well researched support rationales aligning with company goals. No matter how prepared I was, they always tore the work apart and sent back conflicting strategy that made no sense and wouldn't achieve the client's goals.Then they finally met me in person.""When is this Lynn woman going to get here?"" the Sr. Head of Strategy stated with an afternoon cocktail in hand. ""Ummm... I'm Lynn, standing right here."" The whole group went silent as they looked me up and down. ""Wait, you're a man?""After this interaction, their responses to my strategy decks were generally no feedback or simple ""Looks good.""Shocking? Not for women who deal with this their whole careers.Now, I'm dealing with the inverse. A recruiter this week called me (they were in the HR function) and asked to speak with ""Lynn."" ""That's me,"" I replied. ""That can't be; you sound like a man?"" I explained that I had checked the ""Male"" box in the gender question part of the application process. Within a few sentences, she excused herself from the call ""Sorry, I forgot something. I'll need to call you back.""That call never came.I have encountered the second comment more frequently as I turned 50. Ageism has been a problem for me in the past 5-8 years, particularly in marketing where anyone over 40 years-of-age is deemed either too expensive on the FTE budget or not relevant to the target audience for messaging and creative development. It's frustrating, but I am working on adapting to the situation.Which Lynn would you consider hiring?Image is courtesy DALL-E, where I input my LinkedIn photo and asked the AI to draw two genders for myself.

It seemed apt that whilst we were recording,#ChatGPT4was launched.""The generative power of large language models is remarkable because it's generative. It makes stuff up.Making stuff up is a feature not a bug.That is what its supposed to do.It’s supposed to make stuff up.If I want to find facts I’ll do a search - I’ll go to google or wikipedia and I’ll be very careful about what the sources are.Just use the right tool for the job.""I also mentioned a poem that I generated (with the assistance of ChatGPT3.5) when I was visiting my Mum this weekend. It was about pigeons in the snow in her garden. We asked for it in the style of Philip Larkin. It would seem a shame not to share it. This was#GenerativeAI, and it was harmless, and it meant that we shared a much needed giggle.#PigeonsintheGardenIn my mum's garden, there's a bloody mess,Pigeons shit on everything, causing distress,The songbirds are scared off, their chirps suppressed,Leaving us with a garden, that's a sorry jest.The snow still lingers on the cold, hard ground,But the bulbs keep poking through, making a sound,Of hope and resilience, amidst the filth around,A sign that nature's force, can never be bound.Yet, the bloody pigeons, they just won't quit,Ravaging the buds and the leaves, bit by bit,Their coos and flutters, making me want to hit,Them with a stick, until they finally submit.But my mum, she loves them, with a passion,Feeding them seeds, like it's some kind of ration,And I can't help but wonder, with a sense of frustration,If she's gone mad, or if it's just my imagination.So here I stand, in my mum's garden,Pigeon shit on my shoes, and my heart harden,But amidst the chaos, there's a beauty unburden,A reminder that life, is more than just garden.[and yes pic thanks to DALL-E]",0.0319,0.7152056277056277,10 ,23,0

Edo Bar-Gil,15-03-2023,"A few AI-based tools that can change your life (IMHO 😊) -When ChatGPT was released, it quickly became something that people couldn’t stop talking about (yours truly is one of those people 😊).However, it’s not the only tool that is free (or cheap) and that can really change your life / work routine and boost your productivity.Below is a list of a few AI-based tools that I find very useful (on some of which I have already wrote about):·  Wordtune (https://www.wordtune.com/) – Wordtune is the ultimate AI writing tool that rewrites and rephrases your writing. Think of it as your personal assistant in drafting your thoughts in words.·  Canva’s Magic Write (https://lnkd.in/d-3kNp-e) - Simply type in a prompt describing what you’re looking to create and then the AI kickstarts a first draft to best suit your vision. It’s useful for drafting strategy documents, meeting agendas, letters etc.·  Eleven Labs (beta) (https://lnkd.in/dFb6Ueig) – an audio tool that generates top-quality spoken audio in any voice and style. It can be used for storytelling, articles or newsletters to be read, and for audiobooks.·  Midjourney (https://lnkd.in/dFb6Ueig) – Similar to Dall-E 2, this tool allows to create graphics and art via text inputs. All you need to do is tell it exactly what you need for an image and it creates it for you within seconds.·  Papercup (https://www.papercup.com/) – amazing AI based translation tool for videos. You can simply translate any video, which means that you can reach millions of users from different countries with over 70 languages available.·  Rationale (https://rationale.jina.ai/) – think of it as your strategy top confidential partner. The tool is meant to assist in making tough decisions. All you have to do is enter a pending decision and it will list pros and cons or generate a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis to help you weigh your options.·  OtterPilot (https://otter.ai/home) - automated meeting summaries, slides capture and meeting notes, that streamline the meeting process and enable to skip unnecessary meetings.As always, I would be happy to get any comments / feedback. Please lmk if you were / weren’t aware of some of these tools and which of them changed your life 😊.",0.9887,0.5072380952380953,21 ,49,1

Pavel Krishchuk,15-03-2023,"PLEASE OUTLINE THE FONTSOnce in the quirky town of Typography, a designer named Dolly Doodle was famous for her eccentric fashion and love for fonts. Each day, she wore outfits inspired by different fonts, making her a walking, talking embodiment of a diverse font library.Dolly's favorite pastime was creating posters for imaginary events using her extensive font collection. One day, she decided to host a real event – the First Annual Font Festival! She planned a day full of font-themed games, food, and fashion for font fanatics to share their passion.While designing the promotional posters, Dolly discovered a mysterious font called ""Fontasia,"" which changed its appearance every time it was used. Intrigued, she used Fontasia on her posters, and they became the most eye-catching designs she had ever made.Word spread quickly about the Font Festival, and font enthusiasts from far and wide RSVP'd. Dolly prepared tirelessly for the big day, and when it finally arrived, the town of Typography was buzzing with excitement.Everyone dressed in outfits inspired by their favorite fonts, and the highlight of the event was the Fontasia Fashion Show. As Dolly took center stage, her Fontasia-inspired dress shimmered under the spotlight. As she danced, the font transformed into an array of styles and colors, leaving everyone in awe.Suddenly, Fontasia went rogue! The font began to change uncontrollably, growing larger and more erratic with each transformation. Soon, the entire town was engulfed in a chaotic jumble of letters and styles. Arial acrobats became entangled in serifs, and the Times New Roman toga party was trapped in a labyrinth of text.Desperate to save the day, Dolly climbed to the top of the tallest building in Typography and pleaded with Fontasia. ""Please, Fontasia, you are a beautiful and unique font, but we need order and harmony to coexist. Please outline the fonts and help us bring peace back to our town!""With a flash, Fontasia understood the importance of balance and outlined itself, settling into a stable and elegant style. The town returned to normal, and the First Annual Font Festival became the most memorable event in Typography's history. From then on, whenever Dolly designed a new poster, she remembered to say, ""Please outline the fonts!""(story generated with ChatGPT, pic generated by DALL-E 2)#chatGPT#ai#artificialintelligence#dalle2",0.9947,0.5980614973262031,0,7,0

Ola Andersson,15-03-2023,"And there it is. I förra veckan fick vi veta att Open AI skulle släppa GPT-4 - alltså version 4 av den teknik som ChatGPT är baserad på - och nu har den landat.Jag börjar på ungefär samma sätt som när jag skrev om förhandsinfon förra veckan: det handlar om version 4 av GPT - inte version 4 av ChatGPT. Det är alltså den språkmodell som ChatGPT använder som nu har uppdaterats.Den stora nyheten i beskedet förra veckan var att GPT-4 skulle hantera multimodala kommandon. GPT-4 kan alltså hantera mer än bara textkommandon. Det är alltså ungefär som Googles multisök som släpptes förra året: AI:n kan kan förstå både text och bild. Vilket alltså skulle kunna innebära, även här en Google-parallell, att man kan ladda upp en bild på exempel på vad man vill att AI:n ska skapa och komplettera med textinstruktion.Det leder förstås till frågan om AI:n i och med detta också skulle kunna spotta ur sig svar i flera format. Open AI står ju exempelvis även bakom bildskapar-AI:n DALL-E. Men här är svaret nej. GPT-4 kan förstå bilder som ”kommandon”, men den kommer fortfarande bara svara med text.Och precis som Open AI-VD:n konstaterade när han avfärdade den där virala bilden med jämförelsen mellan GPT-3 och GPT-4 som ”bullshit” (för att förtydliga: den var alltså fejk) så handlar det om en inkrementell förbättring. En från version 3.5 till version 4. GPT bli bättre, snabbare och ännu lite smartare - men det kommer inte att bli någon himlastormande skillnad för slutanvändaren. Enligt Open AI själva.Men hur blir det då med ChatGPT? Jodå, den får också GPT-4. Så den kommer att bli lite vassare. Kommer även till ChatGPT:s API (det senare har en väntelista). Vi kan väl anta att de som betalar för ChatGPT får snabbare tillgång.Det mest intressanta i nyheten är beskedet att Open AI ”för att förbereda bildinmatningskapaciteten för en bredare utrullning kommer att samarbeta med en enda partner initialt”. Frågan är alltså vilken tjänst eller vilket företag som kommer att stå för bildigenkänningsskillsen. Microsoft känns väl lite som en… lågoddsare.Men frågan är hur Open AI tänker sig att flera partners ska fungera här? Nu när jag tänker efter så känns det som att det kanske helt enkelt handlar om vilken molnleverantör som ska sköta de tunga lyften.https://buff.ly/3mPIiU0#digitalaspaningar#chatgpt#openai#ai",0.0,0.5,2 ,17,0

Aitor Porcel Laburu,14-03-2023,"¿La industria de la construcción se está quedando atrás en la revolución de la inteligencia artificial?A medida que la ciencia de datos, la inteligencia artificial y el ""big data"" se vuelven más omnipresentes en diversos campos, uno podría preguntarse si la industria de la construcción, con sus prácticas tradicionales, está adoptando estas nuevas tecnologías lo suficientemente rápido. Aunque se habla de cómo la inteligencia artificial va a transformar la construcción, hay pocos ejemplos concretos de su implementación en esta milenaria industria. ¿Será que un perro viejo no aprende trucos nuevos?En este post, vamos a compartir algunos casos reales de la aplicación de la ciencia de datos a la construcción. Estos ejemplos ilustran cómo se están utilizando modelos de machine learning para mejorar algunos aspectos en la industria de la construcción.Por ejemplo, DALL-E 2 y Midjourney son herramientas de inteligencia artificial que pueden utilizarse para ayudar a arquitectos a crear los primeros bocetos de los edificios:https://lnkd.in/d3e_pE5GPor otro lado, ARCHITEChTURES es una plataforma que utiliza IA para el diseño asistido de edificios residenciales:https://lnkd.in/dU_fn42vEn el rubro de la ingeniería, es posible utilizar modelos de machine learning para predecir el tráfico aéreo:https://lnkd.in/detXzMhsO para detectar fallas de pavimentos en base a fotografías:https://lnkd.in/dSE7QURsyhttps://lnkd.in/d_9JJHdCTambién puede utilizarse para identificar sectores de carretera que necesitarán mantenimiento:https://lnkd.in/dvTf_jwUEn el campo de la energía, es posible utilizar modelos de machine learning para predecir el consumo de electricidad y así optimizar el uso de energía renovable:https://lnkd.in/dtY5GTfGEn este notebook, el autor intenta estimar el confort térmico de las personas utilizando un modelo de clasificación:https://lnkd.in/dNtHbK3YEn resumen, si bien todavía la industria de la construcción no está utilizando de manera generalizada IA, lentamente aparecen algunos intentos de sumar a la ciencia de datos a la misma como pudimos ver en los ejemplos anteriores.#InteligenciaArtificial#Construcción#Arquitectura",-0.5803,0.82,0,9,0

While today's#technologycan get you closer to reality, when mapping supply chains ""end-to-end"", there are often two perspectives of which the second frequently is forgotten:1️⃣ The first is the#transactionalor ""order"" perspective, which focuses on who you buy from, where you sell/ship to, and maybe where your suppliers buy from and your customers sell to.

Swapnil Amin,14-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0

Brian Yam,14-03-2023,"Want to integrate OpenAI into your own product?It's hard not to get excited and hop on the bandwagon due to FOMO with the recent AI launches by HubSpot, Notion, Slack, and other leading SaaS companies.But is it the right move? I think every company that is considering an OpenAI integration need to think through these 3 questions.1. Is it a distraction to your roadmap?It's easy to build a cool OpenAI integration that gets your users excited, but will it actually deliver value? Unless you can ship it in a day or two with a tool likeParagon, you probably don't want to dedicate weeks of product and engineering resources on the integration until you've gone through through proper discovery.2. How will you train the model?Chatgpt is fun to play with out of the box, but its generalized nature means that its capacity to provide meaningful value is limited. Without appropriate training on your product specific context, it will be a gimmick at best. Think about what data you need to train the model on before you release it out into the public.3. How will you offset the costs?OpenAI API requests are not cheap. For text based responses you're paying per group of characters (tokens), for DALL-E you're paying per image, and for Whisper you're paying per minute of speech. If you release your integration out in the wild for free and users start playing nonstop with different prompts, your OpenAI invoice is not going to be fun to pay off.While answering the first two questions is extremely contextual and specific to your situation, the third problem of costs is universal.Thats why I'll be sharing strategic and tactical advice in my next post that will help you address the issue of OpenAI API costs.In the meantime, if you do have an OpenAI integration idea for your product, please share it below! I'm always fascinated by new, innovative use cases.And if it's interesting enough, perhaps we can build an MVP of it under an hour with Paragon's new pre-built OpenAI integration.#ai#openai#integrations",0.9949,0.4574544142725961,5 ,31,1

Dr. Andree Bates,15-03-2023,"A recent study, scheduled to be presented at an upcoming computer vision conference, demonstrates that#AIcan read#brainscansand re-create largely realistic versions of images a person has seen.As this technology develops, researchers say, it could have numerous applications, from exploring how various animal species perceive the world to perhaps one day recording human dreams and aiding communication in people with paralysis.Many labs have used AI to read brain scans and re-create images a subject has recently seen, such as human faces and photos of landscapes. The new study marks the first time an AI algorithm called Stable Diffusion, developed by a German group and publicly released in 2022, has been used to do this. Stable Diffusion is similar to other text-to-image “generative” AIs such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, which produce new images from text prompts after being trained on billions of images associated with text descriptions.Unlike previous efforts using AI algorithms to decipher brain scans, which had to be trained on large data sets, Stable Diffusion was able to get more out of less training for each participant by incorporating photo captions into the algorithm. It’s a novel approach that incorporates textual and visual information to “decipher the brain,” says Ariel Goldstein, a cognitive neuroscientist at Princeton University who was not involved with the work.",0.891,0.3140692640692641,0,0,0
Dr. Volker Meise,15-03-2023,"""Disruptive"", ""insane"", ""mindblowing"" - immer, wenn neue Technologie so beschrieben wird, bin ich skeptisch. Nicht so bei#GTP-4 , der neuen Version des KI-Modells u.a. hinter#ChatGPT- denn die Auswirkungen sind kaum zu überschätzen. Hier die wichtigsten Fakten, warum.💪 Mehr Parameter: GPT-4 kann noch mehr Daten verarbeiten und komplexere Texte generieren als GPT-3, denn GPT-4 hat 170 Billionen Parameter im Vergleich zu 175 Milliarden von GPT-3.💪 Größere Trainingsmenge: GPT-4 wurde mit 45 GB Trainingsdaten angelernt, während bei GPT-3 nur 17 GB verwendet wurden. Dadurch hat GPT-4 hat mehr Wissen, versteht Kontext besser und macht weniger Fehler.💪 Bilder als Input: GPT-4 akzeptiert Bilder als Eingabe, versteht deren Inhalt und kann daraus Beschriftungen, Klassifizierungen und Analysen erzeugen (""multimodal"").Insgesamt ist GPT-4 in der Lage, Texte mit größerer Kohärenz und Natürlichkeit zu erzeugen als GPT-3. Es kann Aufgaben erledigen, die Textverständnis und Zusammenhänge erfordern - wie z.B. Zusammenfassungen. Und das war schon beim alten ChatGPT beeindruckend zu erleben.Die Auswirkungen werden weitreichend sein:⭐ Beratung und Forschung reloaded: Schon jetzt ist GPT-4 beeindruckend gut darin, komplexe Zusammenhänge zu verstehen und neu zu sortieren, etwa die Zusammensetzung von Medikamenten zu erkennen und Alternativen vorzuschlagen. Wird es mit Spezialdaten trainiert (bspw. allen wissenschaftlichen Artikeln eines Fachgebietes), können in kürzester Zeit Analysen erstellt werden, die früher aufgrund des Aufwands sehr lange gedauert haben oder gar nicht erst in Angriff genommen wurden.⭐ Call-Center werden den Weg der Zeitungen gehen: Sie werden komplett digital oder zur Nische, denn die Mensch-Maschine Kommunikation springt auf ein neues Level. Bisher musste man bei Chatbots mögliche Antworten der Nutzer:innen voraussehen, um sinnvolle Antworten bereitzuhalten. GPT-4 versteht auch komplexe Fragen und erzeugt realistische Antworten - die dann als Text oder (KI-generiert) in natürlicher Sprache ausgegeben werden.⭐ Wir werden unseren Augen nicht mehr trauen können: KI-basierte Dienste wie DALL-E, Midjourney oder Stable Diffusion sind bereits jetzt extrem gut in der Erzeugung von realistischen Fotos auf der Basis von Textbeschreibungen. Mit realen Fotos trainiert, können neue Bilder einer Person mit beliebigen Gesichtsausdrücken in frei wählbarer Umgebung generiert werden. Kleiner Nebeneffekt: Stockfoto-Portale werden überflüssig.⭐ Alte Fähigkeiten werden wertlos, neue Fertigkeiten sind gefragt: Einfache Texte schreiben oder simplen Programmcode erstellen? Das kann die Maschine ab jetzt besser und schneller. In Zukunft braucht es Fähigkeiten, die KI-Tools so zu steuern, dass das gewünschte Ergebnis herauskommt (""prompt engineering"").Kurz: ""Mindblowing"". Und ich bin mir sicher, dass noch längst nicht alles ist. Da kommt noch mehr.https://lnkd.in/emttWY-J#GPT4#ChatGPT#KI#AI#Disruption#digitaleTransformation",-0.9904,0.5,5 ,3,0

Kate Xie,15-03-2023,"Can AI make better art than humans? It's an interesting questionArtificial intelligence has been infiltrating every industry and the world of arts and culture is no exception. In other words, AI art is poised to explode.AI text-to-image generators such as DALL-E or Midjourney have been creating remarkable visual artworks. ChatGPT has taken the world by the storm with its ability to answer questions, write essays, and summarize texts, among other things. AI-generated art is even being displayed at world-renowned museums.These examples show just how powerful generative AI can be and bid this pressing question: is AI about to replace human artists? It is a question worth thinking about.Seth Dobrin, IBM's first-ever Global Chief AI Officer, has an answer.AI-generated visual art already exists in various forms. There are examples of artists — such as Refik Anadol — who are the actual creators, but use artificial intelligence to augment their artworks. There are also tools like DALL-E which “are getting there,” although it's difficult to say whether their works are truly indistinguishable from humans'.Dobrin has a similar view on news articles, noting that financial news is already being automatically generated to an extent. And while he doesn't believe that AI-generated text is as engaging as a writer's would be, he explained that GPT-3 and Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate stories that journalists can use as a starting point.But when it comes to movies and novels, AI has a longer way to go. That's because “AI needs to truly learn emotion, really be able to simulate it, and invoke empathy — better than it can today,” Dobrin said. He expects five more years for novel creation, and between five to 10 years for movie production.But what's Dobrin's prediction on classical music? And does he believe that AI will merely augment humans in the creative process — or eventually replace them?You can watch the full interview to find out.#AIintelligence#AI#ChatGPT#artificialintelligence#OracleTranslation#manualtranslation#languagetranslation",0.9907,0.4346059113300492,0,0,0
