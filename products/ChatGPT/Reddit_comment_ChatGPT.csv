jawshoeaw,17-02-2023,Yeah I think many people are missing what’s truly revolutionary: a successful interactive natural language interface. I can’t get my phone or Alexa to do the simplest things because their interface is dumb. As in not very smart . It’s so starkly different talking to chatGPT it’s almost like stress relieving. I enjoy having a conversation with a computer that “understands “ me. Imagine if you asked Alexa to turn down the lights and instead of the idiotic “lights doesn’t support that “ it said instead “there are several lights I could dim but you are in your bedroom and yesterday you clarified that you want the bedroom lights turned off when you say this so I will do that now”,0.5822,0.468060643060643,45.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10qvt8l/chatgpt_is_just_the_beginning_artificial/

If we are forced to use school Chromebooks, or whatever, which have configuration restrictions, so you can't configure the Wi-Fi network to use your mobile hotspot, you can simply use a keyboard shortcut to soft reset the Chromebook, which solves that...), there are also thousands of sites like that which exist, such as ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com), CopyAI (https://copy.ai), and so on, so it will be very difficult for Network Administrators to ban them all.

thepo70,17-02-2023,"Fascinating to see all the discussions about consciousness that these technologies bring.But I feel like the word ""consciousness"" is not always well defined. It's a very fuzzy word. For some, it has magical properties, and for others (like myself) it's just the ability of the brain (organic or not) to be aware of itself and its surrounding at the present time and reflect back on it right now. Time seems to be one of the most important factors here. Stuff like ChatGPT is just recalling information that has been previously ""understood"" through the process of pattern recognition and reinforcement learning from human feedback (well, brains do that too). But unlike brains, those chatbots are not doing the reflection work needed to be ""aware of"". And, as far as I understand it, they don't make sense of things either (that would require a thought process). They just recall stuff automatically. But on the other hand, you'd be surprised to know that we do that too, more often than some may think. You probably noticed countless times that you performed ordinary tasks without even thinking about it. Your mind was elsewhere. Nevertheless, you probably drove 3 miles or more, or you just prepared your bag with all the necessary belongings to go to the gym, or even been asked something by someone, and you gave back an answer without thinking about it, and be like ""did you asked me that earlier?"". We're not continuously conscious all day long. However, there are trigger points that make us more conscious and ""awaken us"", because we need this state of mind to make decisions ""now"" that don't rely on unconscious processes.

If we are forced to use school Chromebooks, or whatever, which have configuration restrictions, so you can't configure the Wi-Fi network to use your mobile hotspot, you can simply use a keyboard shortcut to soft reset the Chromebook, which solves that...), there are also thousands of sites like that which exist, such as ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com), CopyAI (https://copy.ai), and so on, so it will be very difficult for Network Administrators to ban them all.

thepo70,17-02-2023,"Fascinating to see all the discussions about consciousness that these technologies bring.But I feel like the word ""consciousness"" is not always well defined. It's a very fuzzy word. For some, it has magical properties, and for others (like myself) it's just the ability of the brain (organic or not) to be aware of itself and its surrounding at the present time and reflect back on it right now. Time seems to be one of the most important factors here. Stuff like ChatGPT is just recalling information that has been previously ""understood"" through the process of pattern recognition and reinforcement learning from human feedback (well, brains do that too). But unlike brains, those chatbots are not doing the reflection work needed to be ""aware of"". And, as far as I understand it, they don't make sense of things either (that would require a thought process). They just recall stuff automatically. But on the other hand, you'd be surprised to know that we do that too, more often than some may think. You probably noticed countless times that you performed ordinary tasks without even thinking about it. Your mind was elsewhere. Nevertheless, you probably drove 3 miles or more, or you just prepared your bag with all the necessary belongings to go to the gym, or even been asked something by someone, and you gave back an answer without thinking about it, and be like ""did you asked me that earlier?"". We're not continuously conscious all day long. However, there are trigger points that make us more conscious and ""awaken us"", because we need this state of mind to make decisions ""now"" that don't rely on unconscious processes. But hey, this is just my take on what consciousness is, but I might be totally wrong. The advancement of AI tech really challenges us in our understanding of what intelligence or consciousness is, and even what Art is when it comes to stable diffusion.",0.964,0.4902636054421769,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/111ogdu/chatgpt_is_intelligent_just_at_a_lower_level_and/
