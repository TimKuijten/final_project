Aruna Pattam,15-03-2023,"🚩 Exploring GPT-4OpenAI has revealed its latest language model, the successor to ChatGPT, called GPT-4.➡️ What is GPT-4 ?GPT-4 similar to ChatGPT, is a Generative AI system, an open source artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI.GPT-4 can be used for a variety of tasks such as chatbot development, automatic summarization tools, content generation tools and more.It has the potential AI applications in many industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation and robotics.➡️ How is it different from ChatGPT?GPT-4 has the capability to not only generate text, but also accept both image and textual input - a major step up from its predecessor of GPT-3.5 which accepted exclusively text.➡️ Some key points on GPT-4﻿* The latest model has the ability to interpret images, enabling it to suggest recipes based on pictures of ingredients and even generate captions and descriptions for visual content.* In addition, the new model has a significantly higher word processing capacity than ChatGPT, being capable of handling up to 25,000 words - roughly eight times more than ChatGPT.* According to OpenAI, the development of safety features for GPT-4 took approximately six months and included training the system on human feedback. Despite these efforts, the organization cautioned that the model may still be susceptible to disseminating misinformation.* Initially, GPT-4 will be offered to subscribers of ChatGPT Plus, who will receive premium access to the service.* GPT-4 has more advanced reasoning capabilities than ChatGPT, being able to offer features such as finding possible meeting times for three separate schedules with ease.* OpenAI has announced partnerships with Duolingo and Be My Eyes to develop AI-powered chatbots that can assist users in natural language. These chatbots will be designed to support language learners and visually impaired individuals.Despite improvements, OpenAI has cautioned that GPT-4 may still be prone to errors such as ""hallucinating"" - where the AI generates false information or erroneous reasoning.#gpt4#technology#innovation#business#generativeAI#ai#gpt#chatgpt#GetStartedAU",0.9746,0.5431107954545455,7 ,60,10

It will blow#ChatGPTout of the water.The long-awaited tool, which can describe images in words, marks a huge leap forward for AI power — and another major shift for ethical norms""HOT OFF THE PRESSES!From the article:""The artificial intelligence research lab OpenAI on Tuesday launched the newest version of its stunning language software, GPT-4, an advanced tool for analyzing images and mimicking human speech, pushing the technical and ethical boundaries of a rapidly proliferating wave of#AI.OpenAI’s earlier product, ChatGPT, captivated and unsettled the public with its uncanny ability to generate elegant writing, unleashing a viral wave of college essays, screenplays and conversations — though it could only generate text, and it relied on an older generation of technology that hasn’t been cutting-edge for more than a year.GPT-4, in contrast, is a state-of-the-art system capable of creating not just words but describing images in response to a person’s simple written commands. When shown a photo of a boxing glove hanging over a wooden seesaw with a ball on one side, for instance, a person can ask what will happen if the glove drops, and GPT-4 will respond that it would hit the seesaw and cause the ball to fly up.The buzzy launch capped months of hype and anticipation over an AI program, known as a large language model, that early testers had claimed was remarkably advanced in its ability to reason and learn new things. The developers pledged in a Tuesday blog post that the technology could further revolutionize work and life.But those promises have also fueled anxiety over how people will be able to compete for jobs outsourced to eerily refined machines or trust the accuracy of what they see online. The developers themselves said they were delaying key features for fear of opening new opportunities for abuse.Officials with the San Francisco lab said GPT-4′s “multimodal” training across text and images would allow it to escape the chat box and more fully emulate a world of color and imagery, surpassing ChatGPT in its “advanced reasoning capabilities.” A person could upload an image, and GPT-4 could caption it for them, describing the objects and scene.""#TScottClendaniel#bigdata#businessintelligence#programming#analytics#datamining#data",0.983,0.569993715961458,24 ,76,11 
Allison Shapira,15-03-2023,"You have a speech coming up; should you use an AI tool like ChatGPT to write it?I’m preparing to answer that question for my graduate students atHarvard Kennedy Schoolin our class, The Arts of Communication.For several years, I’ve studied the implications of artificial intelligence in the field of public speaking.This includes advising AI speech coach companies likeYoodli(Global Public Speaking LLCpartnered with Yoodli to create our own bespoke platform AMPLIFY) and beta-testing half a dozen other platforms and apps.AttendingMIT Technology Review’s Em Tech Digital AI Conference last year provided a deeper understanding of the benefits, risks, and process involved in integrating an AI system into my business.I believe artificial intelligence can be used effectively in a “driver-assist” as opposed to a “driverless” function. It should not replace our speechwriting process, but it can augment the way we prepare.Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are helpful in searching for speech topics, overcoming writer’s block, and finding creative ideas for targeting different audiences.Platforms like Yoodli provide instant feedback on filler words, pacing, and pausing. By integrating ChatGPT, Yoodli offers speech summaries, potential questions to anticipate, and suggestions to make your speech more concise.And this is just the beginning.Who am I learning from in this space?Paul RoetzerofMarketing AI Institutewith their Responsible AI Manifesto for Marketing and Business,Kevin RooseandCasey Newtonon Hard Fork podcast, andPeter H. Diamandison Exponential Wisdom. Finally, my good friend and technologistMatt Strainwho advises companies on generative AI.Beyond the public speaking use case, I see AI completely changing the way businesses tap into and utilize their knowledge. Businesses can train an AI system on their own data in order to synthesize and summarize it, so they can make more informed decisions.For my Harvard class, here’s the guidance I’m planning to offer:- If you choose to use AI tools in this class, I expect you to fully document how you’ve used them and describe it in your post-speech survey. You may not use these tools to generate speech drafts because that can hinder rather than aid your learning in this class. You may not submit AI-generated text as your own.- Remember that generative AI is like a qualitative calculator that is correct only some of the time, especially given potential bias and inaccuracy in the information it contains.- Ultimately, you are responsible for the words that come out of your mouth, both figuratively and literally. I expect any speech you deliver in class to reflect your own stories, anecdotes, beliefs, and opinions.This tipping point in artificial intelligence creates a new technological frontier, and we are all learning as we go.

But while#executivesand#brokersare still exploring AI’s many uses — ChatGPT still has bugs and accuracy issues it’s working out — there’s agreement it holds the potential to make some industry tasks easier.Right now, AI’s biggest benefit is efficiency, according to commercial real estate professionals who joined in on aTwitterconversation aboutChatGPT AI. Users said they asked it to do once-overs for grammar and tone in marketing materials, property descriptions, letters of intent and right of first refusal contracts, to name a few examples.The technology can also help with lease reviews, comparing information against an agreed-upon letter of intent and avoiding bias in favor of the landlord or tenant, users said. Beyond that, it has basic coding capabilities and can perform data analysis to identify market patterns and risks.Some industry professionals are projecting more significant capabilities in the future.“In its current state, I think of it as a tool to assist in improving daily efficiency, but in the long term, I think AI will be transformative to the industry by eliminating repetitive and low-barrier-to-entry jobs,”Bronwyn Scrivens, SIOR, an associate broker at Omada Commercial in Edmonton, Alberta, wrote in an email toCoStar GroupNews.Possible Listings EffectAI has the potential to reshape the#brokerageand#RealEstatelisting service sectors the most, according toKunal Lunawat, co-founder and managing partner ofAgya Ventures, a San Francisco-based real estate technology fund.ChatGPT AIisn’t yet able to access real-time real estate data, but other AI technology has the potential to significantly improve real estate listing searches.

Ben Kunz,14-03-2023,"If you want to thrive in the AI future, you need to become a Prompter.This ""Prompter"" concept, of humans skilled in interacting with artificial intelligence (AI) systems, comes from a SXSW speech yesterday by Kevin Kelly. Kelly, if you don't know him, is the wisest sage of technology, one of the earliest users of the Internet and co-founder of Wired magazine. He tracks trends with skepticism, keeps tech personally at arm's length, and yet has the rare ability to cut through Gartner Hype Cycle baloney to explain the real patterns of technological evolution.Yesterday on stage in Austin, Kelly asserted that today's generative AI mania is more than a fad — it's a tipping point in how humans will use tools. Unlike other tech trends that flare up like fireflies and then fade away, today's AI is more like the transition of the Internet from the code-heavy early 1980s to the invention of HMTL, when suddenly everyone and their grandmother could build web pages. ChatGPT didn't really create a new AI system — similar large language model platforms have been around for a decade. But it made the system really, really easy to use.This is no firefly-tech trend, Kelly says. In the past 2 months, 100 million people have suddenly started using AI to write essays, build business plans, make paintings -- the fastest adoption of any new technology in human history. The interface was the breakthrough, and soon every employee will use AI as commonly as Google search for answers or creations.So what does this mean for jobs? Instead of fighting the use of AI as if it were some form of plagiarism, Kelly suggests educators and businesses need to rapidly *train* people on how to interact *more* with it. The most important job of the future will be what Kelly calls ""Prompters"" — people highly skilled in how to query an AI system, with nuance and mutual exploration, to get just the right answers or outputs.AI basically revamps the old computer adage ""garbage in, garbage out"" to a new rule: ""mediocre prompt, mediocre answer."" Anyone can ask ChatGPT a simple question — ""how do I build a business using AI?"" — and it will respond with the average of all the books and webpages and Reddit links it has digested for a moderately OK answer. But if you challenge ChatGPT with nuance — ""Write a business plan for a new company that helps other companies interact with an AI system using the business rules for growth defined by Peter Thiel in his book 'Zero to One'; include a 24-month plan for sequenced investment; and identify major risks with rollout"" — you'll get output that dazzles you.To stretch these rapidly growing AI tools to their potential, we're going to have to learn how to speak with them.P.S. Here's a wonderful example below: My friendChristopher Smithhas been experimenting with virtual model shoots using AI and Photoshop. The woman below doesn't exist.

Vera Natale,14-03-2023,"Faz pouco mais que 3 meses que o ChatGPT veio a público e já deu muito o que falar. 😎É o tipo de INOVAÇÃO DISRUPTIVA que, em resumo, é aquela que produz algo novo, rompe paradigmas e cria novos hábitos de consumo e comportamentos. No caso, como lidamos com as máquinas.💻É DIFERENTE DA INOVAÇÃO INCREMENTAL que implementa melhorias em processos ou soluções que já existem.Coincidência ou não, muitas empresas correram para oferecer soluções similares ou anunciar que em breve irão lançar soluções parentes do ChatGPT, ou seja, assistentes de escrita que funcionam a partir de comandos, também chamados de “prompts”.Seguem algumas ferramentas de IA (Inteligência Artificial) ou AI (Artificial Intelligence) que funcionam como assistentes de pesquisa e escrita:1. Canva Magic Write (Escrita Mágica) — é um gerador de texto por IA que ajuda a dar e/ou desenvolver ideias de conteúdo para posts, blogs, gerar listas, entre outros, em vários idiomas.2. Notion IA — é um aliado na escrita e composição de ideias. Não escreve apenas para blogs, mas produz resumos, lista de tarefas, pode funcionar como tradutor, editor de textos etc.Por enquanto está disponível em inglês, coreano e japonês e na versão beta (de teste) para alemão e francês.3. Bard — IA geradora de textos do Google que irá integrar as buscas, tornando as pesquisas mais precisas e mais ágeis. A principal diferença em relação ao ChatGPT é que o Bard usará informações em tempo real para dar as respostas. (Será lançado em breve)O ChatGPT foi alimentado com uma quantidade absurdamente gigante de dados coletados somente até 2021.4. LLaMA — é um modelo de IA da Meta aberto somente para profissionais que atuam em universidades e instituições de pesquisa e seu principal objetivo é ajudar essas pessoas em seus estudos sobre aplicações de inteligência artificial.Por exemplo, como a invenção de informações e vieses ou padrões de pensamento inconscientes que levam a discriminações, preconceitos, entre outros.A ferramenta foi treinada com textos de 20 idiomas mais falados no mundo e já está aceitando inscrições de pesquisadores interessados.5. Novo BING chat — a Microsoft lançou nova versão do seu buscador integrado a um modelo semelhante ao ChatGPT. A diferença é que o chat incorporado ao BING foi aprimorado para as pesquisas, conseguindo fornecer respostas contextualizadas, com citação das fontes.Traz uma experiência diferente de bate-papo. Inclusive, essa conversa diferenciada já até virou notícia bem curiosa e engraçada até (😄) no “The New York Times” (confira neste link:https://bit.ly/3FlwUWs).✍️E você já experimentou escrever usando alguma dessas Inteligências Artificiais ou outras?

Eugene Gan,14-03-2023,"Tools maketh the person, or the person maketh the tools?ChatGPT and us.Let's first know the tools1. What is ChatGPT?Basically, it's built upon a language model AI called GPT-3. In simple terms, GPT-3 calculates the probability of the next word that makes sense, and strings them together to form sentences. The folks inopen.aifed GPT-3 with everything we know up to year 2021, using supervised and reinforced learning techniques. Although the core function of ChatGPT is to mimic human conversations, it's versatile enough to perform other functions from all that it learnt. It's also constantly learning from its interaction with human feedback.2. Some misconceptions.ChatGPT is omniscient.Even if we fed it all of what we know, including the library of Alexandria up to this very second, it won't know everything. Because we don't know everything. 'Nuff said.Well, at least it'll tell me what other people know, right?No. As it is fundamentally built as a language tool, it can SOMETIMES form very convincing and plausible sounding sentences regardless of how nonsensical it can be. This common problem is called Artificial Intelligence Hallucinations. It needs time to learn over time, through upvotes or downvotes plus some additional feedback from humans.Does that mean that ChatGPT will one day at least get the ""truth"" right? This is arguably the hardest thing even for us humans to do, even until today. Growing up, we subconsciously rank the quality of ""truth"" by how reliable the source of the information is. We ranked our teachers as reliable, and a stranger (for example) as unreliable. Let's break this down mathematically. If we think our teacher is 5x more reliable than a stranger, it'll take 6 strangers to make us doubt our teacher. Sounds reasonable? Amid all the different voices online, it can sometimes be challenging for us to differentiate the ""truths"" from the bent ones.3. Some current limitations.Bewear of typos.ChatGPT isn't too tolerant with typos. If you didn't even notice the typo at the beginning of this paragraph, it's because us humans are a lot more adaptable and tolerant to mistakes. We are capable of ""autocorrecting"" in real time, and with context. Computer systems are very literal. It assumes you are literal about what you're asking it. Garbage in, garbage out. Literally as simple as that.4. Use cases and potentials.Having said that, there are many uses for ChatGPT or other AI systems that I am very excited about. Ask it to find erroneous lines of software codes, it'll do well. It isn't ambiguous and relative to the person asking. From debugging software to writing essays, I think you've read enough great examples of AI's capabilities and accomplishments.I'm keeping a very keen eye on its development, and I think I might have identified a few industries and use cases for it. I'll be experimenting with my circle of friends and post our progress here.Stay tuned.#ai#chatgpt#artificialintelligence#development",0.9414,0.443576388888889,12 ,19,8

CURAZE,15-03-2023,"#CURAZEgoesSXSW💥 Wrap-up Fourth (and last) Day, Monday March 13th💡 The Most Important Takeaways: Today we had our second private speaker:Mary Gray, Senior Principal Researcher atMicrosoftResearch. The trained anthropologist is considered a leading expert on AI and ethics. She sits on numerous committees, including on theStanford University's One-Hundred-Year Study on Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of thinking about the future of artificial intelligence and making recommendations for its policy implications. The topic at breakfast was – not surprisingly –#ChatGPTand#AI. Of course, we had already heard a lot about this topic at the conference, but with Mary we were able to go deeper into the discussion. Her classification and critical consideration have sharpened our view once again. Her conclusion: With all the huge opportunities that ChatGPT offers, we must develop more awareness and understand that there is a lot at stake here (keywords: data sovereignty, privacy). Unfortunately, what was missed, was to determine the terms of use in advance. In this way, it's like throwing a new drug onto the market untested.On our last day at SXSW there were a few real highlights: Tilda Swinton (10 out of 10 points!), Garry Kasparov, andGinni Romettygave themselves and us the honor. In the evening, New Order held a concert, which we unfortunately missed.❓ The Biggest Challenges: saying goodbye – from the group, the Austin vibes, and the summer temperatures. We embraced the final moments with a few beers during a last sundowner in the Moonlight Bar.📣 Quote of the Day: There are two farewells.One by Garry Kasparov: ""I am very optimistic for the future. But men still have the monopoly on evil."" And from the fabulous Mary Gray: ""As soon as we are not biased anymore – AI will not be biased"". Love it!🖋 Additional: If you can't or don't want to wait a whole year for the next SXSW – from the 15th to the 22nd of October there will be an offshoot in Sydney.

Rohan Korde,15-03-2023,"An asymptotic attempt at answering the biggest question going around...The#chatgpt'movement' has created two sets of opinions. One set cannot wait for it to mimic humanity. The other set is looking to find failure- hack it. Anyhow.The existential question on whether AI could, at a point on the time horizon, replace the day-to-day faculties of the human brain is not a simplistic binary call; it is instead a probability that could perhaps be informed by the#reverse#fibonaccisequenceequation.An illustration of this probability could be a collapsing triad/triangle of intelligence, intellect and wisdom on a Fibonacci spiral with consciousness as the center or origin. Let us assume that intelligence follows intellect follows wisdom follows consciousness (in that order). This is a value chain that ultimately drives consciousness.For definition,#intelligencecan be described as gathered information,#intellectcan be defined as a series of reasoning hypothesis built on top of intelligence. Wisdom on the other hand can be understood as the ability of understand human nature. Human nature can be paradoxical, counterintuitive, counterculture, contradictory or also be conventional), an intersection of the rational and emotional!Thus, while intelligence, at the bottom of the value chain is a machine at work, consciousness is the apex, the stargate to enlightenment.Will AI replace humans?I could choose the reverse fibonacci sequence principle as a safe bet to guesstimate the answer as human brain development follows the fibonacci sequence, growing at a rate dictated by the golden ratio. For AI, therefore, to close the gap between itself and the human brain, the intelligence bubble (illustration attached to this post) has to accelerate on the spiral (shown by the arc) and merge with the intellect bubble, which in turn is also accelerating towards the wisdom bubble. All 3 bubbles then have to eventually collapse into the consciousness core. At least that is how the equation is supposed to play out.At 100 trillion parameters, Chatgpt-4 matches the human brain. But that is capacity. When the chatgpt algorithm runs, 'artificial intellect' is activated, which is pretty much the output we are all getting at the moment from GPT-3 right now, making us go weak in our knees.This is where it gets really, really tough for AI. GPT-X (will call it X as X can hold multiple values) now has to patternize human nature (if at all, with its irrational paradoxes - behavioral variance) in order to come frighteningly close to the human brain. What extent of computing capacity and additional parameters will that take to do is anyone's guess. This is where we hit a bit of a dead wall.So, the short answer to the question is No. Not just yet, unless there is a quantum leap in theoretical understanding that becomes a watershed moment and also humanity's waterloo!#technology#ai#theoritical#pontificate#computing#debate#ramification#ethicalai",0.8392,0.3900396825396825,0,0,0

Laut den Antworten meiner letzten beiden Umfragen kam dabei folgendes zusammen:🚀 Ihr habt gesagt, dass VR oder AR für die Marketingstrategie eines Unternehmens teilweise schon von Bedeutung sind, es aber stark auf die Branche ankommt!🚀 Außerdem wart ihr der Meinung, dass Virtual Reality vielleicht in 3-5 Jahren im Büroalltag zu finden sein wird. Einige meinten jedoch auch, dass sich das nicht etablieren wird.Gerade im Zusammenhang mit dem stetigen Voranschreiten von Artificial Intelligence, die in vielen Bereichen etabliert wird, wird die Verbindung zwischen realer und virtueller Welt in den kommenden Jahren enger werden.

The new language model is already outsmarting all of its predecessors.The demo got me really excited! So let me share with you what it can do and how it outsmarts ChatGPT (= GPT-3.5):🖼️ 1. It understands images! GPT-4 can analyze, describe what's in a picture and make logical assumptions.-> Reads pictures and even full articles from a link.🧐 2. It's less likely to be fooled. GPT-4 is trained to stay within boundaries and not be tricked into saying ""weird"" things.-> 82% better filtering of risky content-> 40% more likely to produce factual responses📚 3. It has a longer memory. Up to 50 pages of text, in fact. So it can keep track of a conversation a whole story.-> Jump from 3,000 to 25,000 word limit.👅 4. It's multilingual. GPT-4 can answer questions accurately in 26 different languages, a significant improvement from previous models.-> Can build sandcastles from text.-> Much faster and more advanced than the last GTP-3.5.The real world implementations of this for education, customer supports, content creation and more are MASSIVE! I'm really curious where this leads. I will share my findings in future posts.GPT-4 is currently available in the ChatGPT Plus subscription for 20$/month or soon in company APIs. Currently tested with companies likeStripe,Khan Academy,DuolingoandMorgan Stanley.❓Is it worth the paid subscription?

He says the tools that are being rushed out — to breathless headlines and cheers from deep-pocketed investors — have been built without the developers ensuring that, as they improve, they keep human benefit as a guiding principle. “How could it be that making AI better and better makes things worse and worse — to the point of total extinction of the human race?” Russell said.",0.9698,0.5354545454545453,0,1,0

For example, the#EU’s AI Act is on track to become a law with a vote expected to happen at the end of March ‘23. Furthermore,#Canadarecently tabled the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act as part of Bill C-27.It will be interesting to see the various regulatory approaches that jurisdictions take to tackle the problem of balancing innovation with risk mitigation and consumer protection.Reach out toKokila Alagh,Akshata Namjoshi,Vivek Prasad,Ankita Dhawan,Bryce MendoncaorKabir Hastir Kumarfor all of your queries related to developments in AI regulation.https://lnkd.in/g_CeePgz#artificialintelligence#data#privacy#bigtech#UAE",0.9098,0.6284533648170012,1 ,6,2

Alexander Smazhuk,15-03-2023,"Artificial intelligence, ChatGPT... Could it be a revolution in marketing?It's not a new Google algorithm or a social media add and not even a usual chatbot. Be sure with ChatGPT and the same technologies we are already at the start of a new digital era.According to OpenAI ChatGPT uses ""reinforced learning with human feedback"" (RLHF) — which is what makes it sound so real. And that's why it could replace some marketing specialists.What tasks could the business solve with ChatGPT?Customer supportOne of the biggest advantages of ChatGPT is its ability to provide personalized customer experiences. By using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, ChatGPT can understand the nuances of human language and respond to customer queries in real time. This means that businesses can use ChatGPT to provide personalized responses to customers based on their specific needs, preferences, and interests. For example, if a customer is looking for a specific product or service, ChatGPT can provide relevant recommendations based on their search history and purchase behavior.Analytics and researchesAnother way ChatGPT can change the future of marketing is by providing businesses with valuable insights into customer behavior. By analyzing customer interactions with ChatGPT, businesses can gain insights into customer preferences, needs, and pain points. This information can be used to improve product development, customer service, and marketing strategies. For example, if customers are frequently asking for a specific feature or product, businesses can use this information to develop new products or improve existing ones.LidgenerationChatGPT can also help businesses to automate lead generation. It could be used to qualify leads and schedule appointments with potential customers. So it could free up sales teams to focus on closing deals.Content creationWith the help of ChatGPT, you could create a general content plan, ideas for content lines, and single everyday posts.By automating only these tasks, businesses can save time and resources, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their business.Wright down in comments what other marketing tasks and functions can ChatGPT perform for the business.P.S. On the other side, AI still could not change the human mind in the processes of strategy creation. So if you need to form the vision for your business, define global and short-term goals, create a comprehensive promotion strategy, or determine the methods of its implementation, then write your questions to me in personal messages!#marketing#business#sales#digital#ai#artificialintelligence#machinelearning#google#content#customerservice#analytics#algorithms#marketingconsultant#businesscoach",0.9916,0.3800696035990153,0,0,0
Dr. Dimitrios Geromichalos,15-03-2023,"""Talking About Large Language Models""Dank der rasanten Fortschritte im Bereich der künstlichen Intelligenz sind wir in eine Ära eingetreten, in der sich Technologie und Philosophie auf interessante Weise überschneiden. Im Zentrum dieser Überschneidung stehen große Sprachmodelle (Large Language Models, LLMs). Je besser LLMs die menschliche Sprache nachahmen, desto anfälliger werden wir für Anthropomorphismus, d. h. dafür, die Systeme, in die sie eingebettet sind, als menschenähnlicher zu betrachten, als sie tatsächlich sind. Dieser Trend wird durch die natürliche Tendenz verstärkt, philosophisch aufgeladene Begriffe wie ""weiß"", ""glaubt"" und ""denkt"" zu verwenden, wenn diese Systeme beschrieben werden. Um diese Tendenz abzuschwächen, plädiert dieses Papier dafür, immer wieder einen Schritt zurückzutreten, um uns daran zu erinnern, wie LLMs und die Systeme, zu denen sie gehören, tatsächlich funktionieren. Die Hoffnung ist, dass eine größere wissenschaftliche Präzision zu mehr philosophischer Nuancierung im Diskurs über künstliche Intelligenz führen wird, sowohl innerhalb des Fachgebiets als auch im öffentlichen Bereich.https://lnkd.in/e67sR5rm#LLM#LLMs#MLLM#AI#KI#artificialintelligence#Künstlicheintelligenz#gpt4#chatgpt",-0.9761,0.4285714285714285,0,4,1

CURAZE,15-03-2023,"#CURAZEgoesSXSW💥 Wrap-up Fourth (and last) Day, Monday March 13th💡 The Most Important Takeaways: Today we had our second private speaker:Mary Gray, Senior Principal Researcher atMicrosoftResearch. The trained anthropologist is considered a leading expert on AI and ethics. She sits on numerous committees, including on theStanford University's One-Hundred-Year Study on Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of thinking about the future of artificial intelligence and making recommendations for its policy implications. The topic at breakfast was – not surprisingly –#ChatGPTand#AI. Of course, we had already heard a lot about this topic at the conference, but with Mary we were able to go deeper into the discussion. Her classification and critical consideration have sharpened our view once again. Her conclusion: With all the huge opportunities that ChatGPT offers, we must develop more awareness and understand that there is a lot at stake here (keywords: data sovereignty, privacy). Unfortunately, what was missed, was to determine the terms of use in advance.

Rohan Korde,15-03-2023,"An asymptotic attempt at answering the biggest question going around...The#chatgpt'movement' has created two sets of opinions. One set cannot wait for it to mimic humanity. The other set is looking to find failure- hack it. Anyhow.The existential question on whether AI could, at a point on the time horizon, replace the day-to-day faculties of the human brain is not a simplistic binary call; it is instead a probability that could perhaps be informed by the#reverse#fibonaccisequenceequation.An illustration of this probability could be a collapsing triad/triangle of intelligence, intellect and wisdom on a Fibonacci spiral with consciousness as the center or origin. Let us assume that intelligence follows intellect follows wisdom follows consciousness (in that order). This is a value chain that ultimately drives consciousness.For definition,#intelligencecan be described as gathered information,#intellectcan be defined as a series of reasoning hypothesis built on top of intelligence. Wisdom on the other hand can be understood as the ability of understand human nature. Human nature can be paradoxical, counterintuitive, counterculture, contradictory or also be conventional), an intersection of the rational and emotional!Thus, while intelligence, at the bottom of the value chain is a machine at work, consciousness is the apex, the stargate to enlightenment.Will AI replace humans?I could choose the reverse fibonacci sequence principle as a safe bet to guesstimate the answer as human brain development follows the fibonacci sequence, growing at a rate dictated by the golden ratio. For AI, therefore, to close the gap between itself and the human brain, the intelligence bubble (illustration attached to this post) has to accelerate on the spiral (shown by the arc) and merge with the intellect bubble, which in turn is also accelerating towards the wisdom bubble. All 3 bubbles then have to eventually collapse into the consciousness core. At least that is how the equation is supposed to play out.At 100 trillion parameters, Chatgpt-4 matches the human brain. But that is capacity. When the chatgpt algorithm runs, 'artificial intellect' is activated, which is pretty much the output we are all getting at the moment from GPT-3 right now, making us go weak in our knees.This is where it gets really, really tough for AI. GPT-X (will call it X as X can hold multiple values) now has to patternize human nature (if at all, with its irrational paradoxes - behavioral variance) in order to come frighteningly close to the human brain. What extent of computing capacity and additional parameters will that take to do is anyone's guess. This is where we hit a bit of a dead wall.So, the short answer to the question is No. Not just yet, unless there is a quantum leap in theoretical understanding that becomes a watershed moment and also humanity's waterloo!#technology#ai#theoritical#pontificate#computing#debate#ramification#ethicalai",0.8392,0.3900396825396825,0,0,0

It understands images! GPT-4 can analyze, describe what's in a picture and make logical assumptions.-> Reads pictures and even full articles from a link.🧐 2. It's less likely to be fooled. GPT-4 is trained to stay within boundaries and not be tricked into saying ""weird"" things.-> 82% better filtering of risky content-> 40% more likely to produce factual responses📚 3. It has a longer memory. Up to 50 pages of text, in fact. So it can keep track of a conversation a whole story.-> Jump from 3,000 to 25,000 word limit.👅 4. It's multilingual. GPT-4 can answer questions accurately in 26 different languages, a significant improvement from previous models.-> Can build sandcastles from text.-> Much faster and more advanced than the last GTP-3.5.The real world implementations of this for education, customer supports, content creation and more are MASSIVE! I'm really curious where this leads. I will share my findings in future posts.GPT-4 is currently available in the ChatGPT Plus subscription for 20$/month or soon in company APIs.

It takes humans to identify those needs, to task an AI to attempt to meet them, and to decide if the result does, indeed, actually address them.In regard to#creativity, GPT-4 still remains merely an assistant to human creativity.

Show emotion, be authentic, be humorous, and be engaging.2.) Stay informed - Keeping up with current trends and understanding how they may impact your work is essential in the current climate. A recent article byDrew HarwellandNitasha Tiku(linked here) highlighted that ChatGPT still has its limitations. The system lacks knowledge of events after September 2021 and does not learn from experience, making it difficult for people to teach it new skills.3) Build skills - Every change brings an opportunity, and the opportunity here is to develop skills in areas where AI is less likely to replace human expertise. Skills such as strategic thinking, crisis management, and communication tactics are just a few essential skills that are unlikely to be threatened by AI. Work on developing these skills and remain in the mindset of continuous learning.What do you think? Are you concerned about the impact of AI on PR?Let's open up the conversation and discuss the role of technology in our industry. Embrace the changes and focus on what makes us unique as human PR practitioners.https://lnkd.in/eJ6SSaJ5",0.9763,0.5454871293580972,0,0,0

Philipp Hacker,15-03-2023,"When it rains, it pours. Happy to see that another blog post is out onOxford Business Law Blog, this time on AI Liability. While AI regulation gets a lot of attention these days, we should not forget that the updated Product Liability Directive will have a massive impact on the exposure of AI developers, and the compensation possibilities of consumers/injured persons. With reversals of the burden of proof and disclosure of evidence rules, this may be a game changer in litigation over AI. Particularly if coupled with the (hotly debated) AI Act rules on ChatGPT and other large generative models.I suggest, inter alia, a novel distinction between legitimate and illegitimate harm AI models to guide liability standards; safe harbors to facilitate compliance on the technical level; and rules geared toward making AI more environmentally sustainable.Comments most welcome!Link:https://lnkd.in/eTV56HBkcc:European New School of Digital Studies#liability#ai#lgaim#chatgpt#ml#pld#aiact#eu#law#future#ki#digital#itrecht#itlaw#climatechange#sustainableai#sustainability#compliance",-0.3239,0.4954961704961704,0,1,0

Some marketing gurus are shaking in their boots, fearing that AI and automation will steal their thunder. I mean, who needs a human brain when you've got machine learning algorithms doing the heavy lifting, right? But wait, there's more!While AI and automation have indeed revolutionized the marketing landscape - streamlining tasks, crunching numbers, and even penning catchy copy - there's a silver lining for our human comrades.You see, AI is fantastic for the nitty-gritty, data-driven tasks, but it still lacks the creative spark and emotional intelligence that only humans possess. Well, at least for now.The real question here is, can we all just get along? Can marketers embrace AI as their trusty sidekick rather than a soulless job-snatcher? By combining human ingenuity with the efficiency of AI, we could be looking at a marketing dream team.Let's spark some heated discussions around this tantalizing topic.

Thijs Braem,15-03-2023,"I'm thrilled by the recent release of GPT-4 by OpenAI, the latest generation of its advanced language processing model. Not coincidentally, Alphabet-backed Anthropic is also launching their answer to ChatGPT called 'Claude'. The rapid emergence of generative AI presents exciting opportunities for both cyber security and development cooperation.In the realm of cyber security, generative AI has already been talked about extensively in the past few months. Its potential applications include simulating attacks on a network, generating realistic phishing emails for employee training, detecting cyber incidents in logs, and even automating responses. However, there are also potential risks associated with the use of generative AI in cyber security. Malicious actors can easily use it to find vulnerabilities and exploit them with little technical knowledge.In development cooperation, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize data analysis and task automation. It can analyze large datasets to make data-driven decisions in areas such as public health and education. Additionally, it can automate certain tasks, freeing up staff time for more important work like program implementation and stakeholder engagement. However, there are also potential risks involved, such as the possibility of biases in data analysis that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. I'm eager to see how Enabel's experts will address these risks.Overall, I'm excited to see how this technology will continue to evolve and improve our work in both cyber security and development cooperation!#EnablingChange#GenerativeAIhttps://lnkd.in/ece8Z68zhttps://lnkd.in/euMqufPq",0.9811,0.6006666666666667,0,1,0

Johan Strömquist,15-03-2023,"So,#GPT4is cool. It's fast, it's more accurate and just overall better than#GPT3.Microsoft also posted a research paper the other day on a topic they called#VisualChatGPTwhere they've combined#chatgpt's language capability with a number of visual transformers. In theory (and in the many examples in the paper) this enables a very interesting combination of capabilities where you can speak to the bot with regard to an image.I eagerly went to Microsofts GitHUB repo (https://lnkd.in/d4-i3Dkn) and deployed the app to my Google collab space. And it's really not working... (The picture to this post is the result of me asking the bot ""Generate a photo of a bright red toaster""... and it is very representative of the other results I got.)As you've probably noticed, I'm not one for dissing other people's hard work, and that's not what this post is about either. I believe that team Microsoft will merge these capabilities and make them work in record time. And when they do, we'll have a new interesting generative tool at our finger tips.No, this post is about a crucial phenomenon I've observed many times and it relates strongly to what we casually call ""#innovation"".How many of our innovations are truly original strokes of genius, and how often are they ultimately iterative in nature, combining pre-existing creations into something we've not seen before?Take the iPhone as a great example. Apple took an iPod and added WiFi and a cellular connection - le voila! Add on to that a thereto far unheard of concept - let's just call it a ""store"" - and the innovation is a fact. Multiple pre-existing concepts, ideas and technologies moulded into one, new, ground breaking tool.This is much more interesting than whether or not Microsoft's new playground works as intended - it's the convergence of technologies to support new intentions and purposes.The step Microsoft is taking sounds obvious. Why? Because we've already seen generative AI in language models and with images. So to combine them just makes sense.But have you thought about what this would mean if it wasn't 2D images? What if the model could generate 3D models?I'm a fan of most things 3D. I've got a collection of 3D printers in my garage that makes me wonder how come the small mouse who seems to live there hasn't died of resin fume poisoning yet...You may also have read one of my recent posts here where I connected#chatgptto#sirion my#iphone.Now imagine technological convergence in this space.Let's say I take some pictures and let the model see what kind of  design I like. Can you see me arrive in the kitchen in the morning, only to realise my toaster is broken? What will I do?

Basically, a great virtual assistant for you to compile niched info and even become your greatest blog writer ever. So, would you stop hiring content writer? You can copy and paste the robot's content...but still, gonna need a pair of human eyes to cross check contents and plagiarism. Also, for the free access, it allows mostly 3 usage/ day.However, Chat GPT doesn't talk like Google Assistant or Siri, and normally I will voice talk to google Assistant for some entertainment instead.Is Chat GPT the top Virtual Assistant currently?

You are coming fromMicrosoftbackground so let me try to give some examples from your field (thank you chatgpt):Here's a list of projects or technologies that Microsoft either dropped, discontinued, or failed to capitalize on, which later turned out to be successful in the hands of other companies or in different forms:- Tablet PCs: Microsoft introduced the idea of a tablet PC with Windows XP Tablet PC Edition back in 2002. However, the devices didn't gain much traction, and the idea remained dormant until Apple released the iPad in 2010, which revolutionized the tablet market.- Smartphones and mobile operating systems: Microsoft developed Windows Mobile and later Windows Phone as mobile operating systems to compete with iOS and Android. Despite its early presence in the mobile market, Microsoft failed to gain significant market share and eventually discontinued Windows Phone. Meanwhile, iOS and Android continued to dominate the smartphone market.- Wearable technology: Microsoft introduced the SPOT (Smart Personal Objects Technology) watch in 2004, a smartwatch that could display news, weather, and other information. The project was discontinued in 2008. A few years later, companies like Apple, Samsung, and Fitbit successfully launched their own smartwatches and fitness trackers, creating a thriving wearable technology market.- Virtual assistants: Microsoft's Cortana, introduced in 2014, was an early player in the virtual assistant market. However, it failed to gain significant traction compared to competitors like Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple's Siri. While Cortana still exists, its presence and impact in the virtual assistant market are relatively limited.Personally, I am not jumping with excitement when big companies are announcing their involvement in some#web3technology because most of them and their practices, are the reason why this technology exists - but do I use it as social proof to encourage others to try it?

Swapnil Amin,15-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0

Sami Hotak,14-03-2023,"Are ChatGPT and NLP a threat to programming and software engineering jobs?It seems that current thinking is that ChatGPT and other NLP technology available today are not going to immediately make all coders, programmers, and software engineers redundant.For a start, it can only create relatively simple programs. Ask it for something too complex – such as a sophisticated game or business application, and it will admit its weakness and tell you that the task is currently beyond its abilities.Computers can't yet tell us, for example, what types of code or applications are needed to achieve what we are trying to do. Even if it knows this because we tell it, then ChatGPT, in particular, can’t (at the moment) attempt to create this software that specifically gives us as users a competitive edge over users of another piece of software.For example, we can't tell it to ""make me an e-commerce platform that's more effective at selling than Amazon."" If we wanted this, then we still have to spend the time and effort to first work out what makes Amazon's platform so great and then find a way of doing it better.Due to this, ChatGPT (and other current NLP-based tools) still have limited effectiveness when it comes to creating software designed to give us an edge in business or, indeed, to compete with human creativity and ingenuity.One caveat here is that although we can do our best to extrapolate what might happen in the future, in reality, no-one has a crystal ball. It’s fair to say that a lot of people who were used to AI conversing at the level of Alexa or Siri were somewhat shocked by how good ChatGPT is.Future developments could indeed increase the speed with which we are traveling towards a point in time where human programmers – or many other types of professionals – will simply not be needed. For the time being, however, we can be confident that there is still a wide range of skills required to develop software that computers don’t seem likely to be able to replicate any time soon.Source:Forbes Magzine",0.9809,0.4963169642857143,0,1,0
Steve Mautone,14-03-2023,"Rumors about Apple’s headset have been discussed for over a decade. Since Sergey Brin parachuted out of an airplane at Google I/O: “When will Apple launch a Google Glass competitor?”At the time, smartglasses were little more than a direct smartwatch competitor. And we’ve seen the Apple Watch take over the wearable market in the years that followed. But Augmented Reality glasses provide another level of interaction beyond watches. With a stronger processor and Spatial Computing, AR glasses can make navigation extremely intuitive. They can enable incredible games like Niantic Labs’ Ingress and Pokémon Go and Magic Leap’s Dr. Grordbort’s Invaders. But what will truly change computing is when we all see how Augmented Reality can revolutionize the way we visualize data. Apps like Miro, Apple Freeform, MindNode (Mindmapping) will leap to a whole new level. Instead of staring at a screen, pinching and zooming to get the best view, users will be transported *into* the data, like Tony Stark trying to invent a new element or discover time travel.But more than the display, Apple is set to release a huge upgrade to Siri that’s on par with (or possibly far beyond) the recent trending AI: ChatGPT. Having a headset with Augmented Reality as well as an advanced voice-based AI will change the way we all work.The form factor being a large, ski goggle headset or a sleek pair of RayBans isn’t as important; the hardware will improve and shrink over time. Spatial Computing will truly change the world; AR + AI will be as dramatic of a change to computing as the iPhone was so many years ago.https://lnkd.in/eUUMRT_s#augmentedreality#ai#computing",0.9919,0.6143831168831169,0,4,0

David J. Wilson,14-03-2023,"Good morning! Are you interested in learning more about 2023’s most talked-about technology? 🧐Yes, I'm talking about the exciting world of generative AI, and its potential to transform industries and create new forms of content. Look at my first comment a link to this complete article byMcKinsey & Company, which explains the basics of#generativeaiand its many practical applications.Let me highlight here some key points:➡ Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulation, and even videos. In the category of machine learning, it generates all kinds of new content, such as articles where the grammar is perfect, the tone works, and the narrative flows, or music and art that really make sense.➡#chatgpt—the GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer—it’s a free chatbot that can generate an answer to almost any question it’s asked. And DALL-E is a tool for AI-generated art. ChatGPT is being developed by a team of researchers and engineers at OpenAI, a research organization dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence in a safe and beneficial manner, ChatGPT was first announced and made available to developers in June 2020, and then released for testing to the public on November 30, 2022. As you can see in the image byInsider Intelligence, over a million people signed up to use it in just five days, a new record for user acquisition (Source:Data.ai). Computer code, essays, poems, and even jokes, are examples of what fans have posted while interacting with this chatbot (me included).➡ AI is the practice of getting machines to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks. For instance, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are based on AI technology. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence. Through ML, practitioners develop AI through models that can “learn” from data patterns without human direction. The huge volume and complexity of data have increased the potential for machine learning, as well as the need for it.➡ Machine learning is founded on several building blocks, as our way of transforming your business model atCeibo Digital, starting with classical statistical techniques developed between the 18th and 20th centuries for small data sets. In the 1930s and 1940s, computer pioneers such as Alan Turing began working on the basic techniques for machine learning. Does anyone remember the Turing Machine?➡ Until recently, machine learning was largely limited to predictive models, used to observe, and classify patterns in content. Generative AI was a breakthrough. Instead of perceiving and classifying a photo, machine learning is now able to create an image or text description on its own.Generative AI has the power to transform the way we live and work, and ChatGPT is just one example of the incredible possibilities it offers.

Gaston Algaze,14-03-2023,"During the last couple of months I’ve been trying out ChatGPT, making sure to do it in a way that would go beyond the novelty, trying to address real life challenges.This is what I found.1. It’s relatively easy to use, I can see it embedded in almost every aspect of our daily life. Imagine a smarter Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant.While not entirely smooth yet, it will solve most of the hurdles of modern life. All simple questions will be answered, not googled, answered right here right now.2. There’s a chance people will become more stupid, by relying on AI as people rely today on a GPS to drive everywhere. Experience will still matter, but if we remove people from building such experience, then we’re really putting our own evolution into the AI’s hands.3. Will my job be impacted by this technology? 100% Yes. Will I lose my job? Look if you’re questioning yourself today whether you’re going to lose your job or not, then you probably will. The question is not whether you’ll lose it or not, the question is how you can take this new tool and apply it to make it your own.4. I’m pretty sure this will accelerate the lifecycle of many technologies, products and even cultures. We’re looking at the next real evolutionary stage. And something people don't realize, is that this started not with ChatGPT but many years ago with thousands of other models. AI is coming to stay and we will need to adapt.So now you know what I think the next few years will bring. What's fascinating is that we brought ChatGPT to life by programming it to mirror our own thoughts and expressions. We're now entering a new era where humans won't be the only ones creating things that are uniquely human. There's a growing similarity between the products of human creativity and those of AI. We're even starting to adopt some machine-like characteristics, which makes it easier for robots to learn from us. It's exciting to imagine how humans and robots will work in tandem to achieve incredible feats in the future.So, how do you think AI will impact your world?

I've asked chatGPT to assist me in shedding some light on how AI learns and how its accuracy can be improved through the process of deep learning.ChatGPT says, 🤖""Hey there, Jazzy engineers! Are you wondering how I, an AI language model, learns? It's all thanks to a process called deep learning, which is a fancy way of saying I can learn from large amounts of data by building complex mathematical models.Let me break it down for you. First, I'm fed input data that's preprocessed and transformed into a numerical representation. Then, I'm trained using an algorithm that adjusts the parameters of the mathematical model to minimize the difference between my predictions and the true output values.During training, I learn from my mistakes through a process called backpropagation. It's kind of like how you learn from your mistakes and adjust your approach. Once I'm trained, I can make predictions on new data that I haven't seen before. This is called inference.So, the next time you ask me a question or give me some input, know that I'm using my deep learning abilities to process it and give you the best response I can.""⚜Many of us imagine AI the way its depicted in movies, causing a lot of confusion and misunderstanding about how useful AI can be and how ""intelligent"" the technology actually is.

Mariusz Korba,14-03-2023,"Voice Recognition has slipped under your radar!While everyone is talking about ChatGPT, the voice recognition model Whisper (also by OpenAI) might have been underestimated.We all know Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. But equally, I think many, myself included, are underwhelmed by their accuracy, pushing us back to speak to them with somewhat robotic commands or moving back to typing.At the same time, many people who tried to use ChatGPT found it somewhat inaccurate. Still, I can bet that at least some of that inaccuracy is because they didn't write enough contextual information for the AI to understand the question entirely.I think that with accurate voice recognition, the potential us having a meaningful and precise conversation is much more impressive.With accurate speech ➡️ text will come accurate text ➡️ speech. Take Eleven Labs - their model can understand the context of a text, and with proper voice recognition, it can speak back to you with the tone you'd expect based on the context of that text.So, using Whisper to transcribe our question, GPT to form an accurate and comprehensive response, and the Event Labs to convincingly speak back to us could take our conversations with technology to another level. This would make them more human-like, accurate, and finally useful. Sure, these tools still make some mistakes, but they'll become more capable and helpful with time, and we can already see this.In a business environment, you can imagine meetings/calls where AI automatically takes notes and minutes, extracting key facts, actions, new ideas and who started them. Such notes can then be summarised and even written with the preferred level of detail based on each stakeholder's seniority, needs, knowledge, and interests. Each person can then listen to such a summary at their leisure, making it easier and quicker to digest, like listening to an audiobook vs reading a book - all automatic 🤖.In fact, with OpenAI recently releasing APIs, you don't need to imagine this. Instead, you can implement such a workflow now!Naturally, there will be many more helpful use cases, but, like with any new technology, privacy concerns will be, and should be, raised as well.#ai#artificialintelligence#future",0.9897,0.4580457351290685,0,5,0

For discovery-stage initiatives, emphasize user knowledge and domain expertise. For optimizing and scaling, look for technical depth and data-driven decision-making.- Develop technical knowledge in domain-expert PMs by pairing them with AI technologists during planning. Develop user empathy in more technical PMs with data analysis of usage patterns, and pairing them with user research teams.- Many AI initiatives have been technology led, leading to a bias to hiring AI technologists as PMs rather than upskilling domain experts or optimization-focused PMs in AI.

Der#APIZugang ist leider noch nicht voll möglich, wird aber in den nächsten Tagen folgen.Was ist anders? Die Qualität hat sich deutlich gesteigert, höherer „Faktengenauigkeit“, die Textausgaben sind menschlicher und nicht so gleichmäßig wie vorher. Wobei ihr das auch per Eingabeaufforderung selber steuern könnt.Ich kann also auch einen Text für einen Viertklässler, in Reimform oder mit bestimmten Buchstaben- / Satzkonstruktionen umschreiben lassen. Auch eine Ausgabe in sehr einfacher Sprache ist möglich.Was sehr spannend ist: ich kann verschiedene Medien als Input nutzen. Ein Beispiel: Ich nutze ein Foto von allen Lebensmitteln die ich habe, und frage was ich damit für Gerichte kochen kann. Ich bekomme so eine Liste mit Gerichten und kann mir daraus dann ein Rezept aussuchen.Ich kann ebenfalls eine Toneingabe nutzen, bekomme als quasi einen (halben) Voicebot wie Alexa direkt mitgeliefert.Noch interessanter: Stimmungen von Menschen können eingefangen werden, wenn ihr Fotos als Eingabe verwendet.Wenn ich also weiß, dass jemand gerade wütend oder traurig ist, kann ich ihm einen Inhalt anders zur Verfügung stellen, als wenn er glücklich oder positiv aufgeregt ist.Aber was hat das alles mit#sparkassezu tun?Wir wollen eine völlig neue Art des Kundendialogs schaffen, der nur mit dem Einsatz von#KImöglich ist, und uns ermöglicht unsere 40.000.000 Kunden sehr emotionalisiert anzusprechen.

Yeganeh Soltanpour,15-03-2023,"In today's rapidly evolving world, change is inevitable. When faced with change, one can either embrace it and learn from it, or risk missing out on the benefits it offers. This is especially true when it comes to the advancements in technology, such as ChatGPT, BingAI, and other similar tools that are now making their way into the mainstream. While these tools have been around for some time, their recent acceptance by the wider public has been remarkable. Nonetheless, there is a certain apprehension surrounding the use of AI, given its potential for harm.However, the application of AI to perform routine or menial tasks, which are often prone to human error or negligence, is an exciting development. By linking ChatGPT to my Alexa, for instance, I was able to easily access relevant articles pertaining to my field (which is how I came across the linked article). This is just one example of how AI can be utilised to enhance efficiency and accuracy in our day-to-day activities.Looking ahead, it is possible to envision AI being utilised in student visa applications. The potential benefits such as limiting the number of mistakes made, sometimes by students or agents, which can lead to delays in visa processing times may be something we can reduce. It is an exciting prospect, and one that we should all keep an eye on as we move forward.#ai#Chatgpt#aiforgood",0.9612,0.5962585034013606,2 ,9,0

Dr. Volker Meise,15-03-2023,"""Disruptive"", ""insane"", ""mindblowing"" - immer, wenn neue Technologie so beschrieben wird, bin ich skeptisch. Nicht so bei#GTP-4 , der neuen Version des KI-Modells u.a. hinter#ChatGPT- denn die Auswirkungen sind kaum zu überschätzen. Hier die wichtigsten Fakten, warum.💪 Mehr Parameter: GPT-4 kann noch mehr Daten verarbeiten und komplexere Texte generieren als GPT-3, denn GPT-4 hat 170 Billionen Parameter im Vergleich zu 175 Milliarden von GPT-3.💪 Größere Trainingsmenge: GPT-4 wurde mit 45 GB Trainingsdaten angelernt, während bei GPT-3 nur 17 GB verwendet wurden. Dadurch hat GPT-4 hat mehr Wissen, versteht Kontext besser und macht weniger Fehler.💪 Bilder als Input: GPT-4 akzeptiert Bilder als Eingabe, versteht deren Inhalt und kann daraus Beschriftungen, Klassifizierungen und Analysen erzeugen (""multimodal"").Insgesamt ist GPT-4 in der Lage, Texte mit größerer Kohärenz und Natürlichkeit zu erzeugen als GPT-3. Es kann Aufgaben erledigen, die Textverständnis und Zusammenhänge erfordern - wie z.B. Zusammenfassungen. Und das war schon beim alten ChatGPT beeindruckend zu erleben.Die Auswirkungen werden weitreichend sein:⭐ Beratung und Forschung reloaded: Schon jetzt ist GPT-4 beeindruckend gut darin, komplexe Zusammenhänge zu verstehen und neu zu sortieren, etwa die Zusammensetzung von Medikamenten zu erkennen und Alternativen vorzuschlagen. Wird es mit Spezialdaten trainiert (bspw. allen wissenschaftlichen Artikeln eines Fachgebietes), können in kürzester Zeit Analysen erstellt werden, die früher aufgrund des Aufwands sehr lange gedauert haben oder gar nicht erst in Angriff genommen wurden.⭐ Call-Center werden den Weg der Zeitungen gehen: Sie werden komplett digital oder zur Nische, denn die Mensch-Maschine Kommunikation springt auf ein neues Level. Bisher musste man bei Chatbots mögliche Antworten der Nutzer:innen voraussehen, um sinnvolle Antworten bereitzuhalten. GPT-4 versteht auch komplexe Fragen und erzeugt realistische Antworten - die dann als Text oder (KI-generiert) in natürlicher Sprache ausgegeben werden.⭐ Wir werden unseren Augen nicht mehr trauen können: KI-basierte Dienste wie DALL-E, Midjourney oder Stable Diffusion sind bereits jetzt extrem gut in der Erzeugung von realistischen Fotos auf der Basis von Textbeschreibungen. Mit realen Fotos trainiert, können neue Bilder einer Person mit beliebigen Gesichtsausdrücken in frei wählbarer Umgebung generiert werden. Kleiner Nebeneffekt: Stockfoto-Portale werden überflüssig.⭐ Alte Fähigkeiten werden wertlos, neue Fertigkeiten sind gefragt: Einfache Texte schreiben oder simplen Programmcode erstellen? Das kann die Maschine ab jetzt besser und schneller. In Zukunft braucht es Fähigkeiten, die KI-Tools so zu steuern, dass das gewünschte Ergebnis herauskommt (""prompt engineering"").Kurz: ""Mindblowing"". Und ich bin mir sicher, dass noch längst nicht alles ist. Da kommt noch mehr.https://lnkd.in/emttWY-J#GPT4#ChatGPT#KI#AI#Disruption#digitaleTransformation",-0.9904,0.5,0,0,0

Have you already adopted ChatGPT in your company? 🚀As a forward-thinking software development company, we’re always on the lookout for the latest advancements in technology that can help us deliver high-quality projects to our clients.And while we firmly believe that AI will never replace our talented developers because human ingenuity is irreplaceable, we’re confident that ChatGPT can enhance several processes in the long term. That’s why we adopted this solution, and we encourage our employees to use it. 🤗Many companies have limited or even forbidden the use of ChatGPT across their workforce, that’s why we asked our CEODavorfor his thoughts on the matter. 👇Davor emphasized that embracing ChatGPT can significantly boost the speed and development of the industry. As OpenAI and other organizations continue to improve language models like ChatGPT, it's crucial for us to adopt this new technology sooner rather than later, so we can stay ahead of the curve and respond effectively to the changes the future will bring.Davor also highlighted the importance of using AI responsibly. He encourages our developers to leverage ChatGPT as a complementary tool to their skills, as long as they understand the end result and its implications.“By striking the right balance between human expertise and AI-driven innovation, we can rapidly enhance our understanding of development, while maintaining a strong foundation in our core skills and knowledge.”We also asked our colleagues for feedback on their experience with ChatGPT, and we have to admit that the responses have been quite diverse. 👀While some team members have found it extremely helpful in answering their questions because it gives us the ability to solve our specific cases rather than googling some general examples, others remain unimpressed with given results.And of course, there are those who have playfully attempted to outsmart ChatGPT. They're tossing all sorts of wild questions, twisty tongue-twisters, and goofy riddles at it, just to see if they can trip up the AI. But that's a natural thing to do. And it brings so much laughter to our office. 😂And even though ChatGPT sometimes totally nails it, leaving our pranksters scratching their heads, other times the AI gets all tangled up and can't quite figure things out.We believe this is a great reminder that AI might be super advanced, but it's still got some catching up to do when it comes to our quirky human brains. 🤓#chatgpt#artificialintelligence#softwaredevelopment#Tria",0.991,0.5363782613782615,0,0,0

Bu teknolojiyi erken benimseyenler arasında web sitelerini taramak ve müşteri destek personeline bir özet sunmak için GPT-4 kullanan Stripe ve GPT-4’ü yeni bir dil öğrenme aboneliğine yerleştiren Duolingo yer alıyor.OpenAI’e göre GPT-4, resim ve metin girişlerini kabul edip algılayabiliyor- yalnızca metin kabul eden selefi GPT-3.5’e göre bu büyük bir gelişme- ve çeşitli profesyonel ve akademik ölçütlerde “insan düzeyinde” performans gösteriyor. Örneğin GPT-3, simüle edilmiş bir bar sınavını, sınava girenlerin ilk %10’u civarında bir puanla geçebiliyordu.Şirkete göre OpenAI, ChatGPT’nin yanı sıra bir rakip test programından alınan dersleri kullanarak GPT-4’ü yinelemeli olarak hizalamak için altı ay harcadı ve şirkete göre gerçeklik, yönlendirilebilirlik ve sınırların dışına çıkmayı reddetme konularında “şimdiye kadarki en iyi sonuçları” sağladı.OpenAI, GPT-4’ü duyuran bir blog yazısında, “Sıradan bir sohbette, GPT-3.5 ve GPT-4 arasındaki fark ince olabilir. Fark, görevin karmaşıklığı yeterli bir eşiğe ulaştığında ortaya çıkıyor.

Eric De Cock,15-03-2023,"Waarom ChatGPT-4 de beste keuze is voor uw bedrijfscommunicatie: de evolutie van GPT-3 naar GPT-4 🚀De afgelopen jaren heeft OpenAI indrukwekkende prestaties geleverd met hun reeks taalmodellen, zoals GPT-3 en nu ChatGPT-4. In dit artikel zullen we de belangrijkste verschillen tussen GPT-3 en GPT-4 bespreken en uitleggen waarom de upgrade naar ChatGPT-4 uw bedrijf aanzienlijke voordelen kan opleveren.✅ Verbeterde taalbegrip en nauwkeurigheid:ChatGPT-4 is getraind met meer gegevens en geavanceerdere technieken dan zijn voorganger, GPT-3. Dit resulteert in een beter begrip van context en nuance in gesprekken, waardoor het model nauwkeuriger en nuttiger is voor bedrijfscommunicatie. Bedrijven kunnen profiteren van deze verbeterde nauwkeurigheid door minder tijd te besteden aan het corrigeren van gegenereerde teksten en meer vertrouwen te hebben in de output van het model.✅ Snellere respons- en verwerkingstijden:Dankzij optimalisaties en technologische vooruitgang in GPT-4, kunnen bedrijven genieten van snellere respons- en verwerkingstijden in vergelijking met GPT-3. Dit betekent dat uw team sneller toegang heeft tot de benodigde informatie en effectiever kan communiceren, zowel intern als met klanten.✅ Betere aanpassingsmogelijkheden:ChatGPT-4 biedt geavanceerdere opties voor aanpassing en personalisatie, waardoor het gemakkelijker is om het model af te stemmen op de specifieke behoeften van uw bedrijf. Dit kan variëren van het trainen van het model op bedrijfsspecifieke terminologie tot het instellen van de gewenste tone of voice. Dit zorgt voor naadloze integratie en consistente merkcommunicatie.✅ Robuustere contextbehoud:Een van de uitdagingen bij eerdere modellen, zoals GPT-3, was het beperkte vermogen om context over langere tekstreeksen te behouden. ChatGPT-4 is beter in staat om context te behouden, wat resulteert in betere, meer samenhangende en zinvolle output. Dit leidt tot effectievere communicatie en een betere gebruikerservaring voor zowel medewerkers als klanten.✅ Veiliger en verantwoord gebruik:ChatGPT-4 heeft verbeterde mechanismen voor het omgaan met gevoelige informatie en het voorkomen van ongepaste content. Dit maakt het model veiliger en betrouwbaarder voor bedrijfsdoeleinden, waardoor bedrijven met een gerust hart kunnen vertrouwen op ChatGPT-4 voor hun communicatiebehoeften.🙋‍♂️ Persoonlijke conclusie:De overstap naar ChatGPT-4 biedt bedrijven aanzienlijke voordelen ten opzichte van GPT-3, waaronder verbeterde nauwkeurigheid, snellere verwerkingstijden, betere personalisatie, robuuster contextbehoud en verhoogde veiligheid. Deze verbeteringen zorgen voor effectievere en efficiëntere communicatie, waardoor bedrijven meer tijd en middelen kunnen besteden aan strategische en creatieve taken die hun groei stimuleren.#ChatGPT4#OpenAI#Bedrijfscommunicatie#AI#KunstmatigeIntelligentie#Innovatie#Digitalisering#Efficiëntie#Klantenservice#Groeistrategie",-0.5994,0.0,0,0,0
"🌟 Michael Stuck, JD ⚖️",15-03-2023,"There’s been no end to the headlines about ChatGPT lately, but one that I found extra interesting was: “ChatGPT Passes Google Coding Interview for Level 3 Engineer With $183K Salary.”PC Magazine reports that Google ran an experiment where it fed coding interview questions to the AI chatbot, and it passed with flying colors.Now, the caveat: this specific interview process mostly covers technical questions, which the chatbot is particularly good at. But ChatGPT might not be so adept at answering behavioral prompts like “Tell me about a time you overcame adversity.”But give it a few years.As a recruiter for 28+ years, I have witnessed the fear of AI replacing the workforce ebb and flow over the years.

GPT-4 kann Bilder verstehen und analysieren, wie in der Beispielgrafik zu sehen ist.Es ist somit ein multimodales System, das im Gegensatz zu ChatGPT nicht nur mit Text gefüttert werden kann, sondern Text- und Bildverständnis kombiniert. Es kann z.B. komplizierte Zusammenhänge in einer Grafik verstehen und einfach erklären.Das System soll den Menschen außerdem bei kreativen Problemstellungen noch besser zur Seite stehen. So kann die KI beispielsweise beim Schreiben von technischen Texten oder Songs Hilfe leisten.Da GPT-4 natürlich keine unternehmensspezifischen bzw. -internen Daten und Zusammenhänge kennt, stößt die KI im Business-Kontext an ihre Grenzen.Die Technologie hinter GPT-4 ist dafür allerdings sehr spannend.➡️ Mehr dazu in dem Paper vonOpenAI:https://lnkd.in/dgYXBPFqWir freuen uns schon darauf, sie in unseren Projekten auf individuelle Fragestellungen anzupassen und einzusetzen. 👩‍💻#Chatgpt#gpt4#Künstlicheintelligenz#artificialintelligence#texterkennung#bilderkennung",-0.9508,0.0,0,3,0

Luka Kankaras,15-03-2023,"ChatGPT AI's freemium strategy - 4 simple takeaways:1. Nailed the 'aha' moments for free users• Go ahead and ask anyone...if they've ever given ChatGPT a shot, they'll rave about it.• A few weeks ago I even showed my mother how she could use it to come up with different recipes, and she was amazed (I think she's still talking about it).• The free experience does not restrict you from reaching the ""aha"" moment.""2. Right value metric to upsell to the premium (Plus) plan• While the free version sufficed for basic tasks, it didn't quite cut it for those who spent hours on ChatGPT.• The limit of use & API access created a virtual barrier for the most powerful users to signup for the ""Plus"" plan.3. Rapid promotion through its Plus plan evangelists (emotional & social motivation)• You know those super enthusiastic people who knock on your door and try to convert you to their religion? Well, that's basically what happened to the ""Plus"" plan users.• Plus plan users turned into ChatGPT evangelists and flooded Twitter and Reddit with posts bragging about their premium experience.• It's like they were saying, ""Hey, look at me, I'm on the VIP list and you're not! Don't you want to be cool like me?"" It's hard not to get FOMO when they're waving their fancy features in your face.4. Exclusivity of new products to specific user segments by allowing only ""Plus"" users to even try Chat GPT4 & to a limit.• a fancy gated community for the new version, i.e. a walled garden around itself that only ""Plus"" users could enter, and even then, it is like they are only allowed to peek inside for a limited time.• Even better, if you want to join and stay in this exclusive club, you gotta pay up and keep paying up every year.#openai#chatgpt#freemium#productgrowth#pmf#gtmstrategy",0.9936,0.5547922077922078,0,1,0

Ein wesentlicher Teil meiner Arbeit liegt darin, herauszufinden, was meinem Auftraggeber hilft, was für das Produkt sinnvoll ist und wie wir die Zielgruppe optimal ansprechen. Dann erst schreibe ich. Bei einigen meiner besten Projekte hatte ich aber gar kein oder nur ein sehr dürftiges Briefing und das ist nicht ungewöhnlich.Unter anderem geht es um Intention und Perspektive. Hat ChatGPT nicht, müsst Ihr ihm vorgeben. Doch habt Ihr Euer Profil, Eure Absichten bereits definiert, kennt Ihr die Bedürfnisse Eurer Zielgruppe? Dann muss aber immer noch jemand die Texte abnehmen, auch weil ChatGPT – und das ist systemimmanent – herrlichen Quatsch generiert.ChatGPT macht für Unternehmen und Projektleiter nichts einfacher, es ist eher wie IKEA und verlagert Aufgaben zum Kunden. Aber um Texte zusammenzustöpseln, wird ein Fünfer-Inbus nicht reichen, und Textverständnis ist in Deutschland ein knappes Gut. ChatGPT berät auch nicht, es hat keine Personality, die müsst Ihr schon selbst mitbringen. Jemand muss ChatGPT sehr genau sagen, was es tun soll. Umso nötiger ist ein präzises Briefing, was vorab eine klare Strategie, Profiling und Positionierung erfordert. Und können wir schauen, ob ChatGPT das geeignete Tool ist.#storytelling#scriptwriting#ai#communications#profiling#positionierung",-0.9337,0.0,0,1,0

Within two months of its release it reached 100 million active users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application ever launched. Users are attracted to the tool’s advanced capabilities – and concerned by its potential to cause disruption in various sectors.A much less discussed implication is the privacy risks ChatGPT poses to each and every one of us. Just the other day, Google unveiled its own conversational AI called Bard, and others will surely follow. Technology companies working on AI have well and truly entered an arms race.The problem is it’s fuelled by our personal data.300 billion words. How many are yours?ChatGPT is underpinned by a large language model that requires massive amounts of data to function and improve. The more data the model is trained on, the better it gets at detecting patterns, anticipating what will come next and generating plausible text.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, fed the tool some 300 billion words systematically scraped from the internet: books, articles, websites and posts – including personal information obtained without consent.If you’ve ever written a blog post or product review, or commented on an article online, there’s a good chance this information was consumed by ChatGPT.So why is that an issue?Complete article:",0.9587,0.545217209690894,0,0,0

Dr. Volker Meise,15-03-2023,"""Disruptive"", ""insane"", ""mindblowing"" - immer, wenn neue Technologie so beschrieben wird, bin ich skeptisch. Nicht so bei#GTP-4 , der neuen Version des KI-Modells u.a. hinter#ChatGPT- denn die Auswirkungen sind kaum zu überschätzen. Hier die wichtigsten Fakten, warum.💪 Mehr Parameter: GPT-4 kann noch mehr Daten verarbeiten und komplexere Texte generieren als GPT-3, denn GPT-4 hat 170 Billionen Parameter im Vergleich zu 175 Milliarden von GPT-3.💪 Größere Trainingsmenge: GPT-4 wurde mit 45 GB Trainingsdaten angelernt, während bei GPT-3 nur 17 GB verwendet wurden. Dadurch hat GPT-4 hat mehr Wissen, versteht Kontext besser und macht weniger Fehler.💪 Bilder als Input: GPT-4 akzeptiert Bilder als Eingabe, versteht deren Inhalt und kann daraus Beschriftungen, Klassifizierungen und Analysen erzeugen (""multimodal"").Insgesamt ist GPT-4 in der Lage, Texte mit größerer Kohärenz und Natürlichkeit zu erzeugen als GPT-3. Es kann Aufgaben erledigen, die Textverständnis und Zusammenhänge erfordern - wie z.B. Zusammenfassungen. Und das war schon beim alten ChatGPT beeindruckend zu erleben.Die Auswirkungen werden weitreichend sein:⭐ Beratung und Forschung reloaded: Schon jetzt ist GPT-4 beeindruckend gut darin, komplexe Zusammenhänge zu verstehen und neu zu sortieren, etwa die Zusammensetzung von Medikamenten zu erkennen und Alternativen vorzuschlagen. Wird es mit Spezialdaten trainiert (bspw. allen wissenschaftlichen Artikeln eines Fachgebietes), können in kürzester Zeit Analysen erstellt werden, die früher aufgrund des Aufwands sehr lange gedauert haben oder gar nicht erst in Angriff genommen wurden.⭐ Call-Center werden den Weg der Zeitungen gehen: Sie werden komplett digital oder zur Nische, denn die Mensch-Maschine Kommunikation springt auf ein neues Level. Bisher musste man bei Chatbots mögliche Antworten der Nutzer:innen voraussehen, um sinnvolle Antworten bereitzuhalten. GPT-4 versteht auch komplexe Fragen und erzeugt realistische Antworten - die dann als Text oder (KI-generiert) in natürlicher Sprache ausgegeben werden.⭐ Wir werden unseren Augen nicht mehr trauen können: KI-basierte Dienste wie DALL-E, Midjourney oder Stable Diffusion sind bereits jetzt extrem gut in der Erzeugung von realistischen Fotos auf der Basis von Textbeschreibungen. Mit realen Fotos trainiert, können neue Bilder einer Person mit beliebigen Gesichtsausdrücken in frei wählbarer Umgebung generiert werden. Kleiner Nebeneffekt: Stockfoto-Portale werden überflüssig.⭐ Alte Fähigkeiten werden wertlos, neue Fertigkeiten sind gefragt: Einfache Texte schreiben oder simplen Programmcode erstellen? Das kann die Maschine ab jetzt besser und schneller. In Zukunft braucht es Fähigkeiten, die KI-Tools so zu steuern, dass das gewünschte Ergebnis herauskommt (""prompt engineering"").Kurz: ""Mindblowing"". Und ich bin mir sicher, dass noch längst nicht alles ist. Da kommt noch mehr.https://lnkd.in/emttWY-J#GPT4#ChatGPT#KI#AI#Disruption#digitaleTransformation",-0.9904,0.5,4 ,3,0

Avraham Raviv,15-03-2023,"אוקי, GPT-4 הגיע ויחד איתו OpenAI פרסמו מסמך מפורט של 98 עמודים – הנה הסיכום של הדברים החשובים.https://lnkd.in/diFXWAmjראשית על המודל עצמו: עקב ""הנוף התחרותי והשלכות בנושא הבטיחות"", אין שום מידע בנוגע לארכיטקטורה, מספר הפרמטרים ועניינים הקשורים לתהליך האימון.על הדאטה והשימוש בו במהלך האימון יש מעט יותר פרטים: המודל אומן from scratch ולא fine tune על גבי GPT-3.5. בשלב ראשון המודל אומן לחזות את המילה הבאה, ולאחר מכן התווסף גם אימון על ידי RLHF שנועד לתת למודל יכולת יותר ""אנושית"", בדומה ל-ChatGPT. בנוסף, היה דגש מאוד גדול על אופי התוכן שהמודל מייצר, וניסיון להמנע לחלוטין מיצירת תוכן לא ראוי.יש שלושה וריאנטים שונים: מודל שיודע לקבל כקלט עד 8K טוקנים (כמו ChatGPT), מודל שיודע לקבל עד 32K טוקנים, ומודל שיודע גם לקבל תמונות ומידע ויזואלי. רק בשביל לקבל תחושה לעוצמה – 32K טוקנים זה בערך 50 עמודי טקסט, וזה גודל הקלט שהמודל יודע לקבל ולעבד! שלושת המודלים מציגים ביצועים מעולים במגוון משימות, ואולי פה טמון הדבר המשמעותי ביותר בפרסום של GPT-4: בניגוד להרבה שמועות שהתבררו כמופרכות לחלוטין, הדגש המרכזי כאן הוא בשיפור יכולות השפה של המודל. המודל אמנם הרחיב את יכולות הקלט שלו (יותר טוקנים, תמונות), אך הפלט שלו הינו טקסטואלי בלבד, בדומה לדורות הקודמים. הפלט איכותי יותר, אך אינו מערב דומיינים נוספים. אז מי שציפה שGPT-4 יאפשר גם יצירת תמונות/סרטונים/אודיו ודברים נוספים אולי יתאכזב, אך אם מתמקדים ביכולות הבנת השפה – כנראה שיש פה משהו מפלצתי, שעוקף את המודלים הקיימים בצורה ניכרת, ואף מצליח לבצע בצורה טובה משימות מורכבות מאוד שבוצעו בהצלחה חלקית מאוד עד כה.עובדה מאוד מעניינת, שכנראה יש לה תרומה משמעותית להצלחת המודל, היא השימוש של OpenAI בדאטה שנאסף ב-ChatGPT. כמויות הטקסט שהוכנסו אליו על ידי משתמשים הן עצומות, מה שהביא ל-OpenAI כמות עצומה של דאטה מהעולם האמיתי, ואולי יותר חשוב מכך – דאטה עם סוג של פידבק. יש אפשרות ב-ChatGPT לעשות לייק/דיסלייק לתשובות שמקבלים, אך אני מניח שרוב האנשים לא משתמשים בכפתור הזה. עם זאת, עצם ניהול השיחה וההשתלשלות שלה מספקות המון דאטה ברמה איכותית ובעל אופי ""אנושי"", וכנראה יש לו אפקט גדול בתוצר הסופי.עם האיכות בא גם המחיר – יש עלייה פי משמעותית (פי 15-30) ביחס למחיר של ChatGPT, ועלייה של פי 2-3 ביחס למחיר של שימוש ב-davinci-003 (המודל החזק ביותר שהיה עד כה במשפחת GPT).יש עוד הרבה פרטים מעניינים, ובימים הקרובים אנשים יפרסמו שפע של דברים מגניבים על גבי GPT-4. בעיני לפחות, השורה התחתונה היא הדגש ש-OpenAI שמו על איכות הפלט, ולא התמקדו ביכולות נוספות של המודל (וזה לא שהם לא יכולים – יש להם את DALL-E ועוד שפע של פיתוחים ומהנדסים מהשורה הראשונה). זו גישה מאוד מעניינת, ושווה יהיה לראות לאן היא מתפתחת. הפיתוח של המודל הזה התחיל כבר לפני כמה שנים (לפני הפיצוץ של ייצור תמונות שראינו בשנה האחרונה) ומן הסתם זה גם קשור לכך שהמוקד היה רק בפלט של שפה ולא של עוד דברים.עם זאת, אין ספק שהיד עוד נטויה והספירה לאחור ל-GPT-5 כבר התחילה ברגע ש-GPT-4 יצא לאוויר.בסרטון: איך GPT-4 לוקח סקיצה שנכתבה על דף יחיד במחברת והופך אותה לאתר אינטרנט שעובד חלק.",0.2714,0.5,3 ,35,0

A prompt engineer - the profession of the future.What do prompt engineers do? 👩‍🔬Prompt engineers design effective prompts (inputs) that instruct Generative AI to produce desired responses of high quality. It involves defining the context, setting goals, selecting relevant datasets, and fine-tuning parameters to optimize the output. Basically, you manipulate what a Large Language Model does, instead of training your own (which is costly, believe me).Is there a demand for prompt engineers? 🤔#AIis currently a very hot topic, so it’s only natural that individuals who can make the most of AI tools are much in demand. To put this into perspective: “prompt engineering” searches on Google rose more than 5000% in the last few months! I also see more and more job offerings for prompt engineers arising, tempting with attractive salaries. So while most people just play around with ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney etc., some make it their career path. What is special is that it’s not limited to any field - be it#marketing,#salesor even#legal.What skills do I need to become a prompt engineer? ⚒Good news: you don’t necessarily have to be a data scientist. Or a software developer. All you need is to think analytically and creatively! And to be patient enough to go through hundreds of iterations to get to a desired solid prompt, of course.How can I learn#promptengineering? 📚Well, it’s a trial-and-error game. I would argue that one develops some kind of intuition about what a good prompt looks like. But there is also a growing number of different resources where you can read about how to write high-quality prompts. I’ll make sure to share my top 10 later.Do you agree that this could be the hottest job of 2023? Would you apply for a position atAnthropic?

Denis Rothman,15-03-2023,"GPT-4 is now here. I've read so many ridiculous assumptions about the model, that I decided to ask ChatGPT to summarize the transcript of yesterday's live session hosted by Greg Brockman, President and Co-Founder of OpenAI.First, let's see what Greg Brockman had to say and then I'll make 2 comments for you to think about. The links to the resources in this post are in the comment section.▶️ ChatGPT's summary of Greg Brockman's presentation:""On March 14th, Greg Brockman, President and Co-Founder of OpenAI discussed a developer demo of GPT-4 and its capabilities/limitations. The demo showcases GPT-4's ability to perform various tasks, such as summarizing articles into sentences and turning blog posts into rhyming poems. The model is steerable and can adhere to any instruction given to it. The demo also highlights the creation of a Discord bot using GPT-4 as an AI programming assistant to write code in pseudocode and break down problems into smaller pieces. The model's training cutoff is in 2021, which limits its ability to recognize new chat completion formats. Nonetheless, the model is flexible and can be applied to various problems and applications. The text also indicates that the model is highly flexible and can handle a variety of inputs, including code, language, and text, suggesting that it may be capable of processing images in some form, although the exact extent of this capability is not clear from the given information.""▶️ My 2 comments:1. GPT-4 is an incremental evolution of GPT-3.5 turbo(ChatGPT) that will have better ""steering"" flexibility and multimodal capability. It's a good step forward but not a revolution. There is still a lot of work to do such as helping OpenAI by evaluating and providing feedback.2.. DALL-E, Vit, and CLIP are already ""first generation"" multimodal transformers as shown in the image below which is an excerpt from Transformers for NLP, 2nd Edition, Chapter 15, in which I explain the theory of these models and provide notebooks.🔴 Bottom line: For those who understand the architecture of transformer models and are implementing GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4 is an incremental evolution. However, for those who have not kept up with the theory and practice of transformers, GPT-4 is a quantum leap to get up to speed. Some compensate for their lack of knowledge with fantasmagorical hype. This creates the huge gap we can see on social media between science and fiction. Ignore the hype, stick to the science, and get to work on transformers asap!#ai#science#gpt4#chatgpt",0.6918,0.4608383838383839,7 ,45,4

Der Golden Circle ist ein Konzept, das von Sinek in seinem Buch ""Start with Why"" eingeführt wurde. Es ist ein Framework, das Unternehmen dabei hilft, ihre Mission und ihr Warum (Why) zu identifizieren und zu kommunizieren.👨‍💻  Ich: Wäre die richtige Übersetzung von Why in dem Zusammenhang nicht eher Wozu oder Wofür?🤖  ChatGPT: Ja, du hast recht, die Übersetzung von ""Why"" im Zusammenhang mit dem Golden Circle kann je nach Kontext auch mit ""Wozu"" oder ""Wofür"" übersetzt werden. Im deutschen Kontext kann das Wort ""Warum"" jedoch auch passend sein, da es oft als Synonym für ""Wozu"" oder ""Wofür"" verwendet wird und sich auf den Zweck oder die Motivation hinter einer Handlung oder Entscheidung bezieht.In der Tat betont Sinek, dass das ""Why"" im Golden Circle sich auf das ""purpose"" bezieht, was in diesem Zusammenhang mit ""Zweck"" oder ""Sinn"" übersetzt werden kann. Der Fokus liegt darauf, warum ein Unternehmen, eine Person oder eine Organisation das tut, was sie tut, und nicht nur darauf, was sie tun oder wie sie es tun.👨‍💻  Ich: Naja, auch wenn es in Deutschland einfach falsch übersetzt wird, hat das Konzept eine sehr starke Wirkung und ich bin davon überzeugt, dass wir die Welt besser machen, wenn wir mehr über  unsere Überzeugungen sprechen und weniger darüber, wie wir es oder was wir machen.🤖  ChatGPT: Ja, da gebe ich dir vollkommen recht. Das Konzept des Golden Circle ist unabhängig von der Übersetzung sehr wirkungsvoll und kann dazu beitragen, dass Menschen und Organisationen ihre Überzeugungen und Werte besser verstehen und effektiver kommunizieren. Indem wir uns auf unser ""Why"" oder unseren Zweck konzentrieren, können wir uns motivieren, unsere Ziele zu erreichen und einen sinnvollen Beitrag zu leisten.👨‍💻 Ich: Wir brauchen vielleicht bald keine Freunde mehr, mit denen wir uns über solche Themen unterhalten. Und doch ist es wichtig, dass wir unserer Überzeugung treu bleiben und nicht auf alles hören, das uns irgendwer vorkaut und wir dann einfach schlucken. Wenn wir immer nach dem Warum fragen (also nach der Ursache) hängen wir in der Vergangenheit und finden Ausreden (warum -> weil versus wozu -> damit). Es geht darum, dass wir selbst denken und unsere eigenen Fehler und Erfahrungen machen.Warum stehst du jeden Tag auf? Weil der Wecker klingelt.Wofür stehst du jeden Tag auf?

"Manuel Parra Palacios, MSc PMP",15-03-2023,"Ayer martes se anunció el nuevo modelo de lenguaje GPT-4 de OpenAI, un modelo de inteligencia artificial que asegura ser el más avanzado del mundo.GPT-4 tiene 15 veces más parámetros que su predecesor, GPT-3, y es capaz de completar tareas complejas de lenguaje natural con una precisión impresionante. Una de las principales innovaciones de GPT-4 es su capacidad para generar textos coherentes y convincentes a partir de solo un fragmento de texto de entrada. Además, GPT-4 puede crear texto que parece haber sido escrito por humanos, lo que lo hace muy útil para diversas aplicaciones.La capacidad de GPT-4 para entender y producir lenguaje natural se basa en un enfoque de aprendizaje automático conocido como ""aprendizaje profundo"". A través del aprendizaje profundo, GPT-4 puede analizar enormes cantidades de datos de lenguaje natural y aprender patrones en el idioma. Esto permite a GPT-4 generar texto que suena natural y coherente, incluso en contextos complejos.GPT-4 también puede generar respuestas a preguntas complejas, completar oraciones y crear resúmenes precisos de textos largos. Otra de las aplicaciones potenciales de GPT-4 es la creación de contenido para medios de comunicación y marketing. Por ejemplo, GPT-4 puede generar títulos de artículos, subtítulos y descripciones que atraen al público y aumentan la visibilidad del contenido.GPT-4 también tiene la capacidad de traducir texto de un idioma a otro con una precisión impresionante. Esto podría tener un gran impacto en la comunicación global y en la eliminación de barreras lingüísticas.Sin embargo, también hay preocupaciones sobre el potencial de GPT-4 para generar contenido engañoso o manipulado.OpenAI está trabajando en medidas para evitar el uso indebido de GPT-4 y garantizar que se utilice de manera ética y responsable.#ChatGPT#IAFuente: ""OpenAI releases GPT-4, a multimodal AI that it claims is state-of-the-art"".

In other words, AI art is poised to explode.AI text-to-image generators such as DALL-E or Midjourney have been creating remarkable visual artworks. ChatGPT has taken the world by the storm with its ability to answer questions, write essays, and summarize texts, among other things. AI-generated art is even being displayed at world-renowned museums.These examples show just how powerful generative AI can be and bid this pressing question: is AI about to replace human artists? It is a question worth thinking about.Seth Dobrin, IBM's first-ever Global Chief AI Officer, has an answer.AI-generated visual art already exists in various forms. There are examples of artists — such as Refik Anadol — who are the actual creators, but use artificial intelligence to augment their artworks. There are also tools like DALL-E which “are getting there,” although it's difficult to say whether their works are truly indistinguishable from humans'.Dobrin has a similar view on news articles, noting that financial news is already being automatically generated to an extent. And while he doesn't believe that AI-generated text is as engaging as a writer's would be, he explained that GPT-3 and Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate stories that journalists can use as a starting point.But when it comes to movies and novels, AI has a longer way to go. That's because “AI needs to truly learn emotion, really be able to simulate it, and invoke empathy — better than it can today,” Dobrin said. He expects five more years for novel creation, and between five to 10 years for movie production.But what's Dobrin's prediction on classical music? And does he believe that AI will merely augment humans in the creative process — or eventually replace them?You can watch the full interview to find out.#AIintelligence#AI#ChatGPT#artificialintelligence#OracleTranslation#manualtranslation#languagetranslation",0.9907,0.4346059113300492,0,0,0
AI Mindset,15-03-2023,"🚨 Microsoft utilisait GPT-4 pour son moteur de recherche Bing 🚨Microsoft a intégré une version anticipée de GPT-4, l'IA développée par OpenAI, dans son moteur de recherche Bing pour améliorer les résultats de recherche. Cette collaboration étroite entre Microsoft et OpenAI s'explique par l'investissement de plusieurs milliards de dollars de Microsoft dans OpenAI en janvier 2023.Les deux entreprises étaient déjà liées depuis octobre 2022, lorsque Dall-E, le générateur d'image par IA, a rejoint le logiciel Microsoft Designer.

Håvard Ellefsen,15-03-2023,"ChatGPT-4 was released yesterday (as you have probably noticed by now), and already shows an unexpected side effect: industry experts and management consultants being exposed for lack if critical and original thinking, and hints at new use case.Providing ChatGPT with the link pointing to the file red-fox.jpg and being overly excited of it telling you that this is a picture of a red fox is an example of ChatGPT hallucinating and the industry expert not using critical thinking.The same is the case for asking ChatGPT-4 to give a summary of the McKinsey article at an URL showing a file name like «topp use cases of AI». Yes, you get a summary that seems legit, but it has not read the article. Again more an example of most content marketing not having much original thinking, ChatGPT sucessfully hallucinating and industry experts not thinking critically.My proposed use case for ChatGPT is that managment consultants, industry experts, «thought leaders» and writers of content marketing ask ChatGPT how it would summarise the article they are planning of writing, or have just written. Just give it the title. Then delete all the content that ChatGPT comes up with from your article as it’s not original. If you are left with nothing then thats fine. Don’t publish as it’s not providing anything new.",0.7061,0.5422727272727274,3 ,8,0
Etrit Asllani,15-03-2023,"Mira Muratider Kopf hinter ChatGPT und Dall-E und eine Inspiration für viele junge talentierte Menschen mit albanischen Wurzeln.🏡Oh, wie ich mich an die lauen Sommerabende erinnere, als meine Verwandten und ich im Garten saßen und wie zukünftige Philosophen über die Welt sinnierten. Es dauerte nie lange, bis jemand mit einem breiten Grinsen verkündete, dass irgendein Superstar oder Politiker bestimmt albanische Wurzeln hatte. In meiner wilden Jugendzeit war das “Who is Who” der albanischen Berühmtheiten noch recht überschaubar.🇦🇱Doch die heutige 2. und 3. Generation der in der Diaspora lebenden Albaner und Albanerinnen erlebt eine regelrechte Explosion an internationalen Stars und Erfolgen! Egal ob Fußballprofis wie Granit Xhaka und Xherdan Shaqiri oder Pop-Ikonen wie Dua Lipa, Bebe Rexha und Rita Ora – sie alle sorgen dafür, dass die albanischen Jugendlichen vor Stolz platzen und die ein oder andere Gesangseinlage oder sportliche Kür einlegen möchten.Aber Moment mal, es gibt noch mehr! Die jüngeren Generationen entdecken ganz neue Vorbilder, die über Sport und Musik hinausgehen. Auf dem internationalen Parkett finden sich immer mehr Männer und Frauen mit albanischen Wurzeln, die in der Welt der Wissenschaft und Technik für Aufsehen sorgen. Ein strahlendes Beispiel ist die geniale Frau hinter der Technologie von ChatGPT und Dall-EMira Murati – Der Kopf hinter ChatGPT🤖ChatGPT und Dall-E sind zwei künstliche Intelligenz-Entwicklungen aus dem Silicon Valley, die in letzter Zeit für Furore gesorgt haben. Die treibende Kraft hinter diesen beiden Projekten ist Mira Murati, eine 35-jährige Albanerin, die heute im Silicon Valley arbeitet.Murati leitet die Teams für ChatGPT und DALL-E. Schon nach zwei Monaten konnte ChatGPT stolze 100 Millionen aktive Nutzer vorweisen. Zum Vergleich: TikTok knackte diese Zahl erst nach ungefähr neun Monaten, während Instagram dafür zweieinhalb Jahre benötigte.Das in San Francisco ansässige Start-up (mit 375 Mitarbeitern) wird mittlerweile auf schwindelerregende 30 Milliarden Dollar geschätzt. Bei Google sorgte dieser Trend für Schweißperlen – aus Furcht um das eigene Suchmaschinengeschäft.Mira Muratis beeindruckender Werdegang und ihre Arbeit bei OpenAI sind ein Zeichen für ihr Talent und ihre Leidenschaft für Technologie und künstliche Intelligenz. Die Erfolge von ChatGPT und Dall-E zeigen, dass sie noch viel bewegen kann und eine wichtige Stimme in der Tech-Welt ist und ein Vorbild für viele Albanerinnen und Albaner.#inspiration#tech#chatgpt##talent#openai#ki#ai",-0.9953,0.0,3 ,27,0
Alexandros Mylopoulos,15-03-2023,"AI is not new. But in the last 3 months, with the widespread usage of GPT, it reached the ultimate awareness level: My parents are talking about it 😆A new skill is being developed for professionals across industries. Prompt engineering, or the art & science of asking the right questions to optimize the outputs of ChatGPT, will soon be an essential prerequisite for efficient working. I expect job ads to be explicitly asking for advanced prompt engineering skills, already this year. By the end of next year, using AI will be as widespread as Googling is today. Workers who are late in learning how to interact with AI will be left behind inevitably, as they will be lacking this multiplier effect.AI is at the heart of what we do at Baresquare. Our platform produces insights in natural language, similar to the logic of generative AI tools. The wisdom of AI perfectly complements our own expertise in digital analytics, derived from a 15-year experience. We developed a chatbot over 5 years ago, in 2017.

Shoukat Hussain,15-03-2023,"Microsoft laid off an entire team dedicated to guiding AI innovation that leads to ethical, responsible and sustainable outcomes. The cutting of the ethics and society team, as reported by Platformer, is part of a recent spate of layoffs that affected 10,000 employees across the company.The elimination of the team comes as Microsoft invests billions more dollars into its partnership with OpenAI, the startup behind art- and text-generating AI systems like ChatGPT and DALL-E 2, and revamps its Bing search engine and Edge web browser to be powered by a new, next-generation large language model that is “more powerful than ChatGPT and customized specifically for search.”The move calls into question Microsoft’s commitment to ensuring its product design and AI principles are closely intertwined at a time when the company is making its controversial AI tools available to the mainstream.Microsoft still maintains its Office of Responsible AI (ORA), which sets rules for responsible AI through governance and public policy work. But employees told Platformer that the ethics and society team was responsible for ensuring Microsoft’s responsible AI principles are actually reflected in the design of products that ship. The team had been recently working to identify risks posed by Microsoft’s integration of OpenAI’s technology across its suite of products.The ethics and society team wasn’t very large — only about seven people remained after a reorganization in October. Sources who spoke with Platformer said pressure from the chief technology officer Kevin Scott and CEO Satya Nadella was mounting to get the most recent OpenAI models, as well as next iterations, into customers’ hands as quickly as possible.Last year, the reorganization saw most of the ethics and society team transferred to other teams. On March 6, John Montgomery, corporate vice president of AI, told the remaining members that they’d be eliminated after all. Members of the team told Platformer they believed they were let go because Microsoft had become more focused on getting its AI products shipped before the competition, and was less concerned with long-term, socially responsible thinking.Teams like Microsoft’s ethics and society department often pull the reins on big tech organizations by pointing out potential societal consequences or legal ramifications. Microsoft perhaps didn’t want to hear “No,” anymore as it became hell bent on taking market share away from Google’s search engine. The company said every 1% of market share it could pry from Google would result in $2 billion in annual revenue.V-ART SERVICES PVT LTDVector ArtRohit JaiswalKafil Baloch",0.9754,0.4735312306740879,0,1,0

Another major goal, he said, is to “create policies and guardrails for agencies that allow them to be able to use those tools responsibly.”New York City for years has used algorithms to match students with public schools, to power police technologies like gunshot detection tools, and even to target homelessness prevention resources.

In 2019, under then-Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, New York City hired Neal Parikh, a start-up founder who got his PhD in machine learning from Stanford University, to run artificial intelligence strategy, a role that was then under the Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer.“The idea was, essentially, we can't really write these AI policies governing the city's own use of this without understanding what is even out there,” Parikh recalled.His main priority then was shaping New York City’s#AIstrategy, with a document that laid out the city’s philosophy of#digitalrightsand the areas of opportunity for using artificial intelligence and machine learning within city government. Doing this work within the structure of government was sometimes challenging, he said.“The diversity of tasks is a great challenge in doing something like AI policy, because it's not a one-size-fits-all thing. It's often very context-based,” said Parikh. “It's a much harder job than being an AI ethics researcher, I'll tell you that.”Prior AI-focused initiatives, like a task force convened in 2017 to shape algorithmic policy, have run into...",0.9923,0.4699320794148379,2 ,1,0

James Craddock,15-03-2023,"Morning! Over the last couple of months, I've been talking a lot about#AIand#ChatGPT. Last night there was a major#updatemoving from GPT 3.5 to GPT 4.ChatGPT 4 is available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers at $20 per month and is currently restricted to 100 messages in a 4-hour period.ChatGPT 4 will beable to:✔Understand images - eg: writing captions for images or interpreting them and picking out ingredients and suggesting recipes.✔It is capable of handling up to 25,000 words in a single request - about 6 times that of the previous version.✔It has advanced reasoning capabilities✔It's safer, less likely to respond with disallowed content and is more likely to produce factual responses than its predecessor.So I thought I'd interview ChatGPT 4 and ask it what the differences are between ChatGPT 3.5 vs 4.It had many ideas, but they were all hypothetical as it didn't realise that the upgrade had taken place and it was now running on a new version....However, I did get an insight as to how it wanted to be seen by the LinkedIn community. I asked it:❓Please write me instructions for Dall-E-2 to draw me a picture to go with your LinkedIn interview that you feel best represents you.Its response: 🗣 ""Create an illustration featuring a friendly and professional AI language model, ChatGPT, being interviewed for a LinkedIn post. The scene should depict a virtual environment with ChatGPT represented as an advanced, sleek, and modern chatbot or hologram. Include a laptop or computer screen displaying the ongoing interview conversation""Dall-E-2 is an AI image generation tool 📷 created by#OpenAithe company behind ChatGPT - the image used on this post was generated by Dall-E-2 using the text prompt above. So one could say, this is how ChatGPT sees itself...But when questioned, ChatGPT 4 says: 📢 ""As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or self-perception in the way humans do. My purpose is to assist users with their questions and provide information based on the data I've been trained on.""My conclusion, ChatGPT 4 is not the best interview subject or indeed an expert on what the new version of this ground-breaking AI is capable of.I guess I'm just going to have to start using it to see what all the fuss is about. But don't worry I will share my findings.Have you started to use ChatGPT yet?

MIT Machine Intelligence for Manufacturing and Operations,15-03-2023,"It’s impossible to overstate the excitement that currently surrounds the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From generative AI breakthroughs like ChatGPT and DALL-E to advancements in autonomy, enthusiasm about machine intelligence is spreading beyond computer science circles and entering the mainstream market, prompting industry leaders to ask how this technology can be useful to them. Current trends show that AI could augment a workforce, speed up decision-making, improve pipelines, and automate mundane tasks. But there are complex considerations when weighing AI solutions such as sustainability concerns, cost, and limitations. AI adopters also want to be sure that they’re staying up to date with the latest innovations, maximizing the impact of use cases and remaining competitive as this evolving field continues to change.One way to see beyond the horizon in machine intelligence is to understand what’s happening at research institutions like MIT. This year’s AI – Accelerate Impact: MIT MIMO Symposium—a student-led annual event that brings together industry leaders and members of the MIT community to discuss how machine learning is transforming manufacturing and operations—will focus on the current impact of AI and how it can be accelerated going forward.On May 9th, join both industry and academic speakers as they discuss how machine intelligence can increase efficiency, empower sustainability, and be applied to manufacturing and operations.The 2023 Symposium is hosted by MIT MIMO in collaboration withMIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)",0.9912,0.5427350427350427,0,5,1

🇪🇺 Mirko Marangione,15-03-2023,"(- : -]Con popcorn e patatine, al cinema, mi appresto a guardare in 4D il film sulla epocale sfida tra Alphabet Google e Microsoft Bing, dopo l'arrivo degli strumenti di ChatGPT e DALL-E.Bing è un motore di ricerca che si basa sul cosiddetto “linguaggio naturale”, può rispondere a domande complesse e interpretare le parole digitate dall'utente.Google lavora per fornire ""rich answers"", passa in rassegna i risultati della ricerca e trova la risposta alla domanda dell'utente, visualizzando la risposta e un estratto da un risultato di ricerca specifico in una casella nella parte superiore dello schermo.Microsoft e OpenAI annunciano una nuova fase della loro collaborazione a lungo termine che si basa su un ""investimento pluriennale e multimiliardario"" sull'intelligenza artificiale.Google ha annunciato il lancio di Bard, la sua nuova tecnologia di chatbot basata sull’intelligenza artificiale, che si pone in diretta competizione con ChatGpt, il sistema che sta diventando popolare per la facilità di interazione con gli utenti e di risposta alle domande che rappresenta una potenziale minaccia per il popolare motore di ricerca.La sfida delle intelligenze artificiali ha avuto inizio ma ... se la non profit OpenAI diventasse un terzo gigante?In tutta onestà ho già espresso a gran voce che secondo me il futuro delle relazioni umane vedrà gli strumenti non profit in cima e gli strumenti profit come secondari, ma questa è un'altra storia, ovvero quella delle#democrazieavanzatedel nuovo millennio, di cui continuerò a scrivere nel tempo.Per ora guardiamoci questo film!#alphabet#microsoft#openAI#google#bing#googol#richanswer#chatGPT#Bard#profit#nonprofit#democraziaavanzata(-:-]_____________________________________________________________________#approfondimenti:ILSOLE24ORE:https://lnkd.in/em5EtW4JILSOLE24ORE:https://lnkd.in/ePs3Fpx8ANSA:https://lnkd.in/eg7SnihXWIRED:https://lnkd.in/e2WSRKZ6STARTUP MAG:https://lnkd.in/eEi-YXgV_______________________________________________________________________#ImmagineHo creato l'immagine nel post attraverso l'intelligenza artificiale DALL-E.",0.9468,0.75,1 ,0,0
Giordano B Ferreira,15-03-2023,"Você acha que uma pessoa que não saiba nada de programação conseguiria criar um jogo do zero com o auxílio do GPT4?Hoje aOpenAIrealizou o lançamento do GPT4, a nova versão do seu LLM. A demo realizada pelo presidente da OpenAI, Greg Brockman, mostrou a grande capacidade do modelo. Como já esperado, o modelo é multimodal, ou seja, receberá tanto texto quanto imagens como input e apresentará textos como output. Isso cria novos casos de uso como detalhamento de imagens, ou mesmo criação de códigos à partir de uma foto de um desenho realizado em uma folha de papel.Ainda não é possível enviar imagens para a versão pública do modelo, mas eles já disponibilizaram a interface de chat com a versão nova do modelo e eu pude testar. E, respondendo a pergunta lá do início, sim, foi possível criar um clone funcional de flappy bird em menos de 20 minutos.O que eu fiz? Pedi para o GPT4 criar um clone de flappy birds em javascript mostrando todos os arquivos necessários para que o jogo funcione. A resposta inicial foi que não seria possível apresentar o código de todo o jogo, mas já mostrou os primeiros códigos. Ao final da resposta, o modelo informou o que faltava para ter um código funcional (obstáculos, detecção de colisão, pontuação e game over). Depois disso, foi só realizar as perguntas sobre cada um dos pontos e atualizar o código.O mais legal é que todo o código gerado tem uma explicação no final. Uma ótima forma de aprender a programar.Depois disso, criei uma conta noReplituma IDE colaborativa que roda diretamente no browser. Colei o código gerado pelo GPT4. Criei um ícone no DALL-E. Cliquei em publicar e pronto. Estava com o jogo rodando no browser.Claro, para que o jogo ficasse divertido, muitas coisas ainda seriam necessárias. Mas, acredito que seria possível continuar utilizando o GPT4 para incrementar a jogabilidade. Quem quiser ver o resultado final, o link está nos comentários.What a time to be alive.#gpt4#javascript#gamedev#chatgpt",-0.7691,0.72,5 ,26,2

And it's got more horsepower than Vin Diesel during a bank heist. 🏎️💨So what makes this new version better than ChatGPT-3?➊ GPT-4 can understand images. 🧑‍🎨That's right, art history class just got a lot easier.The feature is a research only preview for now, but essentially ChatGPT can accept photos, diagrams, and screenshots as prompts.Why write social media captions anymore when ChatGPT can do it for you?Not only will this enable better feedback loops for generative AI tools like DALL-E, it's a huge accessibility milestone. ChatGPT can now ""read images"" to help the blind and visually impaired.➋ GPT-4 is more accurate. 🎯The new model has broader general knowledge and increased problem solving abilities that produce 40% more accurate results than GPT-3.Which is good because if I want someone to mansplain everything on the Internet to me, I at least want the answers to be correct.➌ GPT-4 is safer. 🦺Just like Liam Neeson, the new model has a very particular set of skills that make it harder to trick or request disallowed content.➍ GPT-4 is multilingual. 🌐I guess AI spent the last 6 months studying abroad because ChatGPT now has high accuracy in 26 languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Russian.➎ GPT-4 is better at biology than you. 🔬The new model scored in the 99th percentile of the Biology Olympiad (basically the nerd olympics).Robots don't even have biology, and now they're better than us humans at that too!?What are you most excited about for ChatGPT-4?#AI#technology#chatgpt#chatgpt4#openai",0.9913,0.4528453364817001,17 ,50,5

Today, three major players announced the release of their language model: Anthropic's#Claude, Googles#palmAPI, and OpenAI's#gpt4And it was only yesterday that Stanford released an open-source version.After watching the press release and skimming the paper, GPT-4 seems to be even more impressive than ChatGPT. It is multimodal (meaning it can understand images), can create a website from a design written on a napkin, understands more languages than ever, and could pass the entry exam for a prestigious University.But the biggest change to me has to be OpenAI's secrecy about its implementation. Over the last three years, we saw open-source initiatives being surprisingly fast at replicating the works of large tech companies, making the technology accessible to everyone. First,#GPT-3 was replicated, then Dall-E, and yesterday#InstructGPT. It seems less likely that GPT-4 will have a similar fate, unfortunately.

Think of it as your personal assistant in drafting your thoughts in words.·  Canva’s Magic Write (https://lnkd.in/d-3kNp-e) - Simply type in a prompt describing what you’re looking to create and then the AI kickstarts a first draft to best suit your vision. It’s useful for drafting strategy documents, meeting agendas, letters etc.·  Eleven Labs (beta) (https://lnkd.in/dFb6Ueig) – an audio tool that generates top-quality spoken audio in any voice and style. It can be used for storytelling, articles or newsletters to be read, and for audiobooks.·  Midjourney (https://lnkd.in/dFb6Ueig) – Similar to Dall-E 2, this tool allows to create graphics and art via text inputs. All you need to do is tell it exactly what you need for an image and it creates it for you within seconds.·  Papercup (https://www.papercup.com/) – amazing AI based translation tool for videos. You can simply translate any video, which means that you can reach millions of users from different countries with over 70 languages available.·  Rationale (https://rationale.jina.ai/) – think of it as your strategy top confidential partner. The tool is meant to assist in making tough decisions. All you have to do is enter a pending decision and it will list pros and cons or generate a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis to help you weigh your options.·  OtterPilot (https://otter.ai/home) - automated meeting summaries, slides capture and meeting notes, that streamline the meeting process and enable to skip unnecessary meetings.As always, I would be happy to get any comments / feedback.

Intrigued, she used Fontasia on her posters, and they became the most eye-catching designs she had ever made.Word spread quickly about the Font Festival, and font enthusiasts from far and wide RSVP'd. Dolly prepared tirelessly for the big day, and when it finally arrived, the town of Typography was buzzing with excitement.Everyone dressed in outfits inspired by their favorite fonts, and the highlight of the event was the Fontasia Fashion Show. As Dolly took center stage, her Fontasia-inspired dress shimmered under the spotlight. As she danced, the font transformed into an array of styles and colors, leaving everyone in awe.Suddenly, Fontasia went rogue! The font began to change uncontrollably, growing larger and more erratic with each transformation. Soon, the entire town was engulfed in a chaotic jumble of letters and styles. Arial acrobats became entangled in serifs, and the Times New Roman toga party was trapped in a labyrinth of text.Desperate to save the day, Dolly climbed to the top of the tallest building in Typography and pleaded with Fontasia. ""Please, Fontasia, you are a beautiful and unique font, but we need order and harmony to coexist. Please outline the fonts and help us bring peace back to our town!""With a flash, Fontasia understood the importance of balance and outlined itself, settling into a stable and elegant style. The town returned to normal, and the First Annual Font Festival became the most memorable event in Typography's history. From then on, whenever Dolly designed a new poster, she remembered to say, ""Please outline the fonts!""(story generated with ChatGPT, pic generated by DALL-E 2)#chatGPT#ai#artificialintelligence#dalle2",0.9947,0.5980614973262031,0,7,0

Ola Andersson,15-03-2023,"And there it is. I förra veckan fick vi veta att Open AI skulle släppa GPT-4 - alltså version 4 av den teknik som ChatGPT är baserad på - och nu har den landat.Jag börjar på ungefär samma sätt som när jag skrev om förhandsinfon förra veckan: det handlar om version 4 av GPT - inte version 4 av ChatGPT. Det är alltså den språkmodell som ChatGPT använder som nu har uppdaterats.Den stora nyheten i beskedet förra veckan var att GPT-4 skulle hantera multimodala kommandon. GPT-4 kan alltså hantera mer än bara textkommandon. Det är alltså ungefär som Googles multisök som släpptes förra året: AI:n kan kan förstå både text och bild. Vilket alltså skulle kunna innebära, även här en Google-parallell, att man kan ladda upp en bild på exempel på vad man vill att AI:n ska skapa och komplettera med textinstruktion.Det leder förstås till frågan om AI:n i och med detta också skulle kunna spotta ur sig svar i flera format. Open AI står ju exempelvis även bakom bildskapar-AI:n DALL-E. Men här är svaret nej. GPT-4 kan förstå bilder som ”kommandon”, men den kommer fortfarande bara svara med text.Och precis som Open AI-VD:n konstaterade när han avfärdade den där virala bilden med jämförelsen mellan GPT-3 och GPT-4 som ”bullshit” (för att förtydliga: den var alltså fejk) så handlar det om en inkrementell förbättring. En från version 3.5 till version 4. GPT bli bättre, snabbare och ännu lite smartare - men det kommer inte att bli någon himlastormande skillnad för slutanvändaren. Enligt Open AI själva.Men hur blir det då med ChatGPT? Jodå, den får också GPT-4. Så den kommer att bli lite vassare. Kommer även till ChatGPT:s API (det senare har en väntelista). Vi kan väl anta att de som betalar för ChatGPT får snabbare tillgång.Det mest intressanta i nyheten är beskedet att Open AI ”för att förbereda bildinmatningskapaciteten för en bredare utrullning kommer att samarbeta med en enda partner initialt”. Frågan är alltså vilken tjänst eller vilket företag som kommer att stå för bildigenkänningsskillsen. Microsoft känns väl lite som en… lågoddsare.Men frågan är hur Open AI tänker sig att flera partners ska fungera här? Nu när jag tänker efter så känns det som att det kanske helt enkelt handlar om vilken molnleverantör som ska sköta de tunga lyften.https://buff.ly/3mPIiU0#digitalaspaningar#chatgpt#openai#ai",0.0,0.5,2 ,17,0

Swapnil Amin,14-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0

Brian Yam,14-03-2023,"Want to integrate OpenAI into your own product?It's hard not to get excited and hop on the bandwagon due to FOMO with the recent AI launches by HubSpot, Notion, Slack, and other leading SaaS companies.But is it the right move? I think every company that is considering an OpenAI integration need to think through these 3 questions.1. Is it a distraction to your roadmap?It's easy to build a cool OpenAI integration that gets your users excited, but will it actually deliver value? Unless you can ship it in a day or two with a tool likeParagon, you probably don't want to dedicate weeks of product and engineering resources on the integration until you've gone through through proper discovery.2. How will you train the model?Chatgpt is fun to play with out of the box, but its generalized nature means that its capacity to provide meaningful value is limited. Without appropriate training on your product specific context, it will be a gimmick at best. Think about what data you need to train the model on before you release it out into the public.3. How will you offset the costs?OpenAI API requests are not cheap. For text based responses you're paying per group of characters (tokens), for DALL-E you're paying per image, and for Whisper you're paying per minute of speech. If you release your integration out in the wild for free and users start playing nonstop with different prompts, your OpenAI invoice is not going to be fun to pay off.While answering the first two questions is extremely contextual and specific to your situation, the third problem of costs is universal.Thats why I'll be sharing strategic and tactical advice in my next post that will help you address the issue of OpenAI API costs.In the meantime, if you do have an OpenAI integration idea for your product, please share it below! I'm always fascinated by new, innovative use cases.And if it's interesting enough, perhaps we can build an MVP of it under an hour with Paragon's new pre-built OpenAI integration.#ai#openai#integrations",0.9949,0.4574544142725961,5 ,31,1

Oracle Tree,13-03-2023,"Exciting news, folks! The buzz around AI and ChatGPT has been hard to miss lately, and we're taking the reins this week to bring you everything you need to know about this game-changing technology.We've got a jam-packed line-up for you, so keep an eye out for our upcoming blog post that will provide you with some incredibly informative insights. But that's not all! We'll be hitting you up every day with fresh and thrilling information about AI that will have you at the edge of your seat. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting topic!But first, let's take a moment to think about how much we've embraced artificial intelligence (AI) over the past decade. From Siri to Tesla Autopilot, Grammarly to Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant to ChatGPT, we're living in a world where AI technology is rapidly evolving and becoming more integrated into our daily lives.As we speak, the conversation around AI is heating up across several industries, including digital marketing, design, writing, psychology, education, and tech. And why shouldn't it? The possibilities of AI are endless and can transform the way we work and live.AI technologies have already started to change the way we create content. For example, have you heard of Descript? It's a tool that can transcribe and analyse audio and video content, making editing a breeze. And let's not forget about Canva, which uses machine learning to make personalized design recommendations and is beta-testing Magic Write in their platform. And for those of us in the video editing space, Wav2Lip generates realistic lip-syncing audio for our videos.But AI's impact doesn't stop there. Runway ML can generate or manipulate images, video, and sound using cutting-edge machine learning models.Now, I know some of you might be worried about the rise of AI and its implications for humanity. However, I want to reassure you that we're not in a Terminator 2-style takeover situation just yet. We must weigh the pros and pitfalls of this new frontier and approach it with caution.So, what do you think about the future of AI and its impact on creativity, information, and humanity as a whole?

Martín Levi,01-03-2023,"I recently chatted with ChatGPT and we discussed why Tesla is likely to be the go-to electric vehicle (EV) brand. It's partly due to the company's well-established name, but also because EVs are similar to smartphones in that the operating system is a critical feature. Elon Musk is often compared to a mix of Steve Jobs and Wozniak, which is a nod to his innovative leadership style and technical expertise.What sets Tesla apart is that its operating system, the Tesla Infotainment System, was specifically designed for electric vehicles. The system runs on a customized hardware platform that includes the Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Computer, which is specially built for autonomous driving. It's equipped with two AI chips that can process vast amounts of data from the car's cameras, sensors, and other sources in real-time.What's particularly impressive about the Tesla OS is that it's software-defined, which means that most of the vehicle's features and functions are controlled by software rather than hardware. This allows Tesla to continually update and improve the driving experience for customers, providing new features and improvements over-the-air without requiring a dealership or service center.Tesla's OS is loaded with features, including Autopilot, Full-Self Driving, Caraoke, Bioweapon Defense Mode, virtual Easter eggs, and smart air suspension. Autopilot can automatically steer, accelerate, and brake, while Full-Self Driving can recognize stop lights, stop signs, and even change lanes on the highway. Caraoke is a fun feature that lets you sing karaoke while driving, and Bioweapon Defense Mode protects passengers by filtering out toxic chemicals.In addition, the Tesla OS includes hidden Easter eggs that provide a fun and unique way to interact with your car. The smart air suspension system adjusts the firmness based on GPS coordinates, providing a comfortable ride. Sentry mode allows you to monitor your parked car remotely from anywhere in the world, and Tesla's network of supercharging stations is expanding rapidly worldwide.Overall, Tesla's innovative OS and microchip have enabled a unique set of features that set its vehicles apart in the automotive market. With a powerful microchip and software-defined system, Tesla can continually update and improve its vehicles, moving at a scary pace.#automotive#change#ev#tesla#electricvehicles",0.9918,0.6331489498156165,0,1,0

Colin Barnden,14-03-2023,"Incredibly timely post on the limits of#deeplearninginThe Ojo-Yoshida Report. A lot of folks are suddenly understanding what ""emergent properties leading to phase transitions in complex systems"" actually means, following the collapse ofSilicon Valley Bank.Financial markets, like public roads, are complex not complicated. Everything works fine, right up to the point at which it doesn't and then the system fails catastrophically. Financial markets are highly automated and sophisticated investors were early adopters of#AIand#DLto find a competitive trading edge. They forgot the lessons of#LTCMfrom 1998.We have just witnessed a phase transition in financial markets, as depositors panicked to remove their funds from#SVB, before the cash ran out. No AI/DL#algorithmcan help you when the bank has been shut down. It took humans (Central Bankers) to decide what to do next and move things forward, but we are at the beginning not the end of the next banking saga.#Autonomousdrivingoffers a similar illusion to financial markets. It looks really easy most of the time, until everything goes wrong at once, and then AI/DL can't help you. It needs human intervention and ingenuity to resolve a problem and get things moving again, until the next snarl up that is.  That is what we see in San Francisco with Cruise and Waymo#robotaxisnafus on an almost daily basis.Taking humans out of the driving loop altogether is like taking central bankers out of the financial system. It wasn't machines that could demonstrate judgment under uncertainty and create a way forward with SVB, it was people.Ironically the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank shines a spotlight onto the autonomous developers, and their messages of taking humans out of the driving loop. Some of those companies will remain in business this month simply because of the actions of humans, but longer term it raises the question of the wisdom of replacing humans as drivers.#ChatGPTis fun.

Nach dem Test machten sie aber auch mehr Sorgen um ihre Jobs, denn der Textroboter könnte ein ernster Konkurrent auf dem Arbeitsmarkt werden. Seitdem OpenAI die Maschine per API zur Verfügung stellt, kann jedes Unternehmen für kleines Geld ChatGPT-Anwendungen bauen - und immer mehr Unternehmen nutzen das Tool fürs Coden, Texte schreiben, Roboter zu steuern oder Zusammenfassungen zu erstellen. Interessant ist auch, wie OpenAI seine KI-Wizards von der Konkurrenz abwirbt, zum Beispiel sein Superhirn Mira Murati, die früher für Tesla das Model X entwickelt hat.• Während die neue KI eine weltweite Begeisterung auslöst, zeigt sich, dass Deutschlands Digitalisierung im vergangenen Jahr kaum vorangekommen ist.

Max Del Rosso,08-03-2023,"🔥 [TEST] IL RIVALE DI CHATGPTHo testato Claude, l’AI di Anthropic, la società in cui Google ha recentemente investito 300 mln di dollari.A mio parere, qualità ottima. Ecco l’articolo:Il futuro è elettrico: come le auto elettriche stanno ridisegnando il domaniAuto a guida autonoma, condivise e sostenibili, le auto elettriche stanno accelerando verso il domani. Secondo gli esperti del settore, progressi nella tecnologia dei veicoli elettrici (VE), insieme a tendenze nella proprietà delle automobili, mostrano che i VE potrebbero presto dominare le strade.""Stanno avvenendo enormi progressi, da nuove tecniche di produzione a maggiore autonomia e più stazioni di ricarica"", afferma l'esperta dell'associazione CALSTART Susan Harris. Harris vede una convergenza tra VE e tecnologia di guida autonoma, specialmente nelle applicazioni di flotte e ride-sharing. ""La crescita di veicoli elettrici autonomi in flotte permetterà di ottimizzare le rotte e aumentare efficienza e convenienza"", dice.La società di previsioni IHS Markit prevede oltre 300 milioni di veicoli elettrici sulle strade globali entro il 2040. Un'infrastruttura elettrica in crescita, veicoli via via più accessibili e incentivi governativi potrebbero accelerare questa rivoluzione. Sarà possibile scegliere tra un'ampia gamma di VE per tipologia ed esigenza, dalle utilitarie alle auto di lusso.Nel presente, la Cina ospita quasi la metà di tutti i VE attualmente circolanti, sostenuta da ingenti investimenti governativi per combattere l'inquinamento. Anche in Europa la diffusione di VE è in rapida crescita, con alcuni Paesi - come Norvegia e Olanda - che mirano ad abolire auto a benzina e diesel entro il 2025. Rispetto a modelli pre-pandemici, la crisi COVID-19 potrebbe accelerare la transizione verso l'adozione di VE, con più persone che preferiscono evitare mezzi pubblici in favore di soluzioni di micromobilità individuale.Protagonisti di questa rivoluzione sono nuove aziende come Tesla e NIO, oltre a big player tradizionali come Volkswagen e Volvo. Crescono anche realtà focalizzate su tecnologie di guida autonoma, come Waymo, che si fondono con l'avanzamento dei VE: si prevede che entro 10-15 anni flotte hi-tech di VE senza conducente debutteranno in servizi di ride-sharing su strade selezionate.Un futuro ""full electric"" promette benefici ambientali, economici e di mobilità. I VE non emettono gas di scarico, riducendo inquinamento e dipendenza da petrolio. Costi di gestione inferiori e prezzi in picchiata ne abbasseranno accessibilità, destinati a diventare più convenienti di auto tradizionali. Nuove forme di sharing mobility potrebbero democratizzare la mobilità, con tutti che potranno permettersi di spostarsi in modo sostenibile. Restano sfide nell'aumentare infrastrutture e nell'incentivare l'adozione tra consumatori, ma con tecnologia e supporto che crescono a ritmo accelerato, auto elettriche ad alta tecnologia ci si profilano come il futuro che già bussa alle nostre porte.",0.6369,0.325,2 ,13,1

Jennifer Hotai,15-03-2023,"ChatGPT prompt: ""Write a LinkedIn post that describes how a growing city like Myrtle Beach can benefit from being a smart city, with blockchain and metaverse technology.""💡As Myrtle Beach continues to grow and attract more visitors and residents, there's an opportunity to leverage technology to enhance the city's infrastructure and services. Imagine a city that can offer personalized experiences to its visitors, optimize its transportation systems, and ensure that its residents have access to secure and reliable digital services.👉🏽That's where being a smart city comes in, and blockchain and metaverse technology can play a key role in making that vision a reality.💎Blockchain technology can help establish secure and transparent systems for managing transactions, such as property purchases and public services. This can help reduce bureaucracy and streamline processes, ultimately leading to a more efficient and effective city government.💎Additionally, the use of blockchain can enhance cybersecurity, protecting the city's sensitive data from hackers and other malicious actors.💎Metaverse technology can offer unique opportunities for tourism and entertainment in Myrtle Beach. Visitors could explore virtual versions of the city's attractions before even arriving, creating a sense of excitement and anticipation. Once they arrive, they could use augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences to enhance their visit and learn more about the city's history and culture.💎Furthermore, metaverse technology can help promote economic development by offering new opportunities for businesses. Virtual storefronts and marketplaces could be established, allowing businesses to expand their reach beyond the physical limitations of their brick-and-mortar locations.💎In short, the benefits of becoming a smart city with blockchain and metaverse technology are numerous and far-reaching. By embracing these innovations, Myrtle Beach can establish itself as a leader in the digital age, offering a unique and exciting experience to its visitors and residents alike.*Image generated in Midjourney#smartcity#blockchain#web3#metaverse#metaversetechnology#vr#ar#immersivetechnology#xr#extendedreality#tech#myrtlebeach#chatgpt#tourism#cybersecurityCity of Myrtle Beach",0.9968,0.5583707958707959,0,1,0

Letícia Tainara Souza,15-03-2023,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, histórico de tendências e evoluções, aqui vão algumas das tendências de marketing para 2023:🤳🏻 Marketing de influência: o marketing de influência chegou pra ficar e continuará a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conteúdo para alcançar públicos específicos (Ó a base da Virginia aí, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).🎁 Personalização: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experiência personalizada e relevante, e as empresas estão investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estratégias para atender a essa demanda.📼 Vídeo marketing: o vídeo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produção de vídeo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Então investe nisso. A era dos estáticos morreu).🔊 Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas estão começando a adotar estratégias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personalização também).📩 Marketing de conteúdo: este continuará a desempenhando um papel importante na construção de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom! Se você é um profissional da área, sugiro começar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estratégias e tomadas de decisão. Pois como diz a famosa música de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por aí, ""hoje é um novo dia, de um novo tempo que começou.

Leah Matthews,15-03-2023,"GPT-4 is here.There's no denying that AI software has cause quite the stir the past few months - especially with the likes of ChatGPT and Midjourney opening the door for the majority to consume (but we'll come to those issues another time).The truth of the matter is that AI is here to stay and it's getting smarter. Whether you take advantage of it and apply it to your business, well, that's another matter entirely.So what can you expect from GPT-4 and why is this news?👉 For starters, GPT-4 has been trained to understand and answer a lot more complex questions than the previous GPT-3 we've all been familiar with.👉 It has a vastly improved output. One of the downfalls of GPT-3 was that it never really understood the text it was generating. GPT-4 goes a step further in that it better understands what you want of it and outputs at a more 'human-like' and nuanced level.👉 It has multimodal learning. Where GPT-3 could only understand text as an input, GPT-4 can be fed images, video and audio and respond with what it sees.👉 It is conversational. It has been designed to engage better in conversations and be much more fluid than it's predecessor.We will see GPT-4 rolled out in a lot of businesses over the next few weeks, some having already done so.What are your thoughts on AI?

Dr. Volker Meise,15-03-2023,"""Disruptive"", ""insane"", ""mindblowing"" - immer, wenn neue Technologie so beschrieben wird, bin ich skeptisch. Nicht so bei#GTP-4 , der neuen Version des KI-Modells u.a. hinter#ChatGPT- denn die Auswirkungen sind kaum zu überschätzen. Hier die wichtigsten Fakten, warum.💪 Mehr Parameter: GPT-4 kann noch mehr Daten verarbeiten und komplexere Texte generieren als GPT-3, denn GPT-4 hat 170 Billionen Parameter im Vergleich zu 175 Milliarden von GPT-3.💪 Größere Trainingsmenge: GPT-4 wurde mit 45 GB Trainingsdaten angelernt, während bei GPT-3 nur 17 GB verwendet wurden. Dadurch hat GPT-4 hat mehr Wissen, versteht Kontext besser und macht weniger Fehler.💪 Bilder als Input: GPT-4 akzeptiert Bilder als Eingabe, versteht deren Inhalt und kann daraus Beschriftungen, Klassifizierungen und Analysen erzeugen (""multimodal"").Insgesamt ist GPT-4 in der Lage, Texte mit größerer Kohärenz und Natürlichkeit zu erzeugen als GPT-3. Es kann Aufgaben erledigen, die Textverständnis und Zusammenhänge erfordern - wie z.B. Zusammenfassungen. Und das war schon beim alten ChatGPT beeindruckend zu erleben.Die Auswirkungen werden weitreichend sein:⭐ Beratung und Forschung reloaded: Schon jetzt ist GPT-4 beeindruckend gut darin, komplexe Zusammenhänge zu verstehen und neu zu sortieren, etwa die Zusammensetzung von Medikamenten zu erkennen und Alternativen vorzuschlagen. Wird es mit Spezialdaten trainiert (bspw. allen wissenschaftlichen Artikeln eines Fachgebietes), können in kürzester Zeit Analysen erstellt werden, die früher aufgrund des Aufwands sehr lange gedauert haben oder gar nicht erst in Angriff genommen wurden.⭐ Call-Center werden den Weg der Zeitungen gehen: Sie werden komplett digital oder zur Nische, denn die Mensch-Maschine Kommunikation springt auf ein neues Level. Bisher musste man bei Chatbots mögliche Antworten der Nutzer:innen voraussehen, um sinnvolle Antworten bereitzuhalten. GPT-4 versteht auch komplexe Fragen und erzeugt realistische Antworten - die dann als Text oder (KI-generiert) in natürlicher Sprache ausgegeben werden.⭐ Wir werden unseren Augen nicht mehr trauen können: KI-basierte Dienste wie DALL-E, Midjourney oder Stable Diffusion sind bereits jetzt extrem gut in der Erzeugung von realistischen Fotos auf der Basis von Textbeschreibungen. Mit realen Fotos trainiert, können neue Bilder einer Person mit beliebigen Gesichtsausdrücken in frei wählbarer Umgebung generiert werden. Kleiner Nebeneffekt: Stockfoto-Portale werden überflüssig.⭐ Alte Fähigkeiten werden wertlos, neue Fertigkeiten sind gefragt: Einfache Texte schreiben oder simplen Programmcode erstellen? Das kann die Maschine ab jetzt besser und schneller. In Zukunft braucht es Fähigkeiten, die KI-Tools so zu steuern, dass das gewünschte Ergebnis herauskommt (""prompt engineering"").Kurz: ""Mindblowing"". Und ich bin mir sicher, dass noch längst nicht alles ist. Da kommt noch mehr.https://lnkd.in/emttWY-J#GPT4#ChatGPT#KI#AI#Disruption#digitaleTransformation",-0.9904,0.5,5 ,3,0

Ellas definirán el valor y la originalidad de nuestro contenido.Los profesionales de la comunicación, el periodismo y el marketing tenemos especial habilidad para sonsacar información y encadenar respuestas y preguntas.

Y tampoco un artículo para una revista científica que una entrada de blog.🖊 No pidas todo el contenido de una tacada: en el caso de un artículo, por ejemplo, puedes empezar solicitando el título y secciones (H2) y después ir encadenando indicaciones para la introducción, desarrollo de cada punto, el SEO, nuevas opciones de títulos, inclusión de fuentes o reducción de la extensión.👀: es posible que ChatGPT interrumpa la generación de contenido de forma repentina.

While waiting on the results (will share them), let me say that one thing I found so far is that clear term-based prompts work best. As for use cases:✅Proofreading - Checking already prepared posts for clarity and grammar.💰G. ads - written 5 responsive Google search ads for keyword of interest with complementary landing page suggestions. Will CTR be better? We'll see.📣Promotional ReactNorway tweets - In how many ways you can write a promotional tweet? Exactly. Huge help inspiration vise. Like this one:https://lnkd.in/dxcq3hUG⚙️Code filled blog post that's checked by our devs - similar to usual blog post writing but with code.📩Emails to potential React Norway sponsors - outreach emails in a creative and cheerful voice to potential sponsors of RN.💡Quick POC proof-of-concept for an imaginary car brand eCommerce store - This will blow your mind.Midjourneyfor images, ChatGPT for imaginary car🚗/product📦 descriptions, free#ecommerceboilerplate fromCrystallizefor a quick storefront (we'll have a Livestream about this)📝Outlines for future posts/video - Instead of doing keyword research on a topic, then checking results, then proposing TITLE, then share it with the dev on task, etc., just add keyword/s of interest and require an article/post/or even video outline.Fist result is 30% more productive with the use of ChatGPT📈Seriously. It took care of mundane tasks and provided me with enough inspiration so I could pick where to go from there. Also, it helped me see if I missed a concept and choose and alter the output the way I want it.That is its power🤖The other side of the ChatGPT coin🪙is that if you don't know about the subject enough, you can neither acknowledge nor confirm if the writing is OK.And that can bite you on the back i.e., G might (and eventually it will) degrade your authority and expertise in a field, hurting your ranking, for example.And now#gpt4is herehttps://lnkd.in/du4jwDwTThe output is definitely much better (tested it both on the same subject and 4 seems to be much more mature in the way it builds sentences).Even though people are already building amazing stuff, let's wait for a few days to find proper use cases for it.The point is AI🤖is not going to replace what you do. It is a tool that can help you be better at what you do.As for the results of my experiments...will post them asap.Oh, and check the comments for some cool links.

Сергей Соболев,15-03-2023,"Запуск GPT-4: новая ступень эволюции ИИ.Ну вот и оно! OpenAI только что выпустили своё последнее творение, GPT-4, и это очередной шаг к настоящему ИИ! Чтобы не затягивать, вот ключевые отличия GPT-4 от его предшественника GPT-3.5:1. GPT-4 демонстрирует производительность на уровне человека в различных профессиональных и академических тестах. Например, результаты GPT-4 входят в 10% лучших на смоделированном экзамене на адвоката, тогда как GPT-3.5 входит в 10% худших.2. Другое ключевое отличие заключается в том, что GPT-4 более надежен и способен обрабатывать более тонкие и подробные инструкции, чем GPT-3.5. Для сравнения, GPT-3.5 был способен обрабатывать до 4 тысяч токенов (что около 16 тысяч знаков), тогда как объём обрабатываемой GPT-4 информации вырос в 8 раз, до 32 тысяч токенов. Это значит, что он способен запоминать историю взаимодействия большего объёма, чем его предшественник, и в том числе сможет писать полноценные большие статьи.3. GPT-4 также имеет возможность “понимать” изображения, тогда как GPT-3.5 был ограничен только текстом. Это означает, что GPT-4 может генерировать текст на основе входных данных, состоящих из текста и изображений. Тем не менее, следует отметить, что входные изображения по-прежнему являются предметом исследования и пока не доступны общественности.4. Наконец, GPT-4 имеет улучшенную достоверность и управляемость по сравнению с более ранними моделями GPT. Хотя он по-прежнему может делать ошибки, GPT-4 оценивается на 40% выше, чем последняя версия GPT-3.5, по внутренней состязательной оценке фактов. Кроме того, GPT-4 обладает большей управляемостью, позволяя разработчикам и пользователям настраивать стиль модели и задачу с помощью системных сообщений в заданных пределах.Нельзя сказать, что GPT-4 – это революция. Это не так. Но мультимодальность модели (способность не только “читать”, но и “видеть”) – это первый шаг к передаче ИИ всех 6 чувств человека (нужно будет добавить ещё слух, осязание, обоняние, равновесие), чтобы в итоге прийти к реальным человекоподобным роботам!#ии#новостиии#нейросети#ai#openai#chatgpt#aiart#midjourney",0.0,0.0,0,1,0

Prenez l'exemple de Canva.Canva permet à certains bleus comme moi de faire des carrousels et des logos pour une utilisation simple.Mais Canva n'a pas remplacé les graphistes (merciFloryanepour la ref !). Non seulement, les meilleur(e)s graphistes sont toujours là, mais Canva a été une bénédiction pour :- Augmenter son prix- Réduire son temps de travail- Réaliser des tâches chronophages de manière automatisée.Aujourd'hui, les graphistes sont mieux nombreux, mais ils sont largement meilleurs qu'avant. Pour ces personnes, Midjourney est une nouvelle étape vers le chemin de l'excellence.Pour les personnes qui font de la communication, les copywriters et les ghostwriters, ChatGPT doit être vu comme un mélange entre Canva et Midjourney.Il faut en faire notre assistant. Dès aujourd'hui.Les personnes qui ont peur de ChatGPT seront remplacées. Les personnes qui l’apprivoisent vont exceller.🔗#chatgpt#communication",-0.5848,0.0,32 ,40,0
Block Trend Media,15-03-2023,近幾個月，網路上充滿 AI 的報導。從 MidJourney 繪圖到 ChatGPT 對話，人們不斷驚嘆 AI 的能力已經超越人類。AI 不僅能拿到華頓商學院的 MBA 學位，更可怕的是只要每月支付數十美元的訂閱費，人人都可以聘請一位 AI 全年無休地替你工作。從影音剪輯、客服問答到軟體開發，AI 可說是無所不能。時薪之低，堪稱勞工之恥。這讓許多人紛紛預言，某些職缺將會被 AI 完全取代。但與此同時，我們也看到另一股與 AI 發展相抗衡的力量 —— 真實性。目前科學權威期刊《Nature》已禁止 ChatGPT 成為作者，程式問答網站 Stack Overflow 也禁止張貼由 ChatGPT 產生的答案，Adobe 則站出來倡導內容真實性的重要。這篇文章討論 ChatGPT 產出的回答可能造成的真實性問題，以及目前有哪些解方。先從近期網路上的一篇熱門文章開始。文章連結：https://lnkd.in/g9CGxMac#ai#chatgpt#openai,0.0,0.0,0,0,0

Ben Panther,15-03-2023,"Events schaffen sich ab...... wenn sie weiterhin nur auf Revenue, Abspulen von vorhersehbaren Inhalten und ""das haben wir schon immer so gemacht"" basieren.In den letzten Jahren haben viele Menschen das Gefühl, dass Social Media zu viel Zeit und Energie in ihrem Leben einnimmt. Einige sind besorgt über die Auswirkungen von Social Media auf ihre psychische Gesundheit, während andere einfach nur müde sind von der Fülle an Informationen und der permanenten Erreichbarkeit. Auch haben die Menschen einfach keine Lust mehr auf Fake-News, negative Kommentare und Verschwörungstheorien (Und NEIN, darüber diskutieren wir hier nicht). Das Resultat ist aber, dass viele ihre Nutzung einzuschränken oder komplett  beenden. Gleichzetig bedeutet das nicht, dass das Bedürfnis nach sozialer Interaktion oder Gemeinschaft verschwunden ist. Im Gegenteil, es hat sich nur verändert. Gerade wenn Social-Media weniger relevant ist und die Menschen erkennen, dass es eigentlich Bullshit ist, was da Online den ganzen Tag passiert, werden Events immer wichtiger.Events bieten die Möglichkeit, Menschen in einer realen Umgebung zu treffen und Zeit miteinander zu verbringen. Ob Konferenz,  Konzert, ein Essen oder eine Business-Festival ist dabei aus dieser Perspektive zweitrangig: Es ist eine Gelegenheit für Menschen, sich zu verbinden, zu lernen, sich zu amüsieren und einfach Spaß zu haben.Psychologisch relevant ist hier der Aspekt, dass Events um ein gemeinsames Interesse oder Thema herum veranstaltet werden. Das bedeutet, dass die Teilnehmer automatisch eine Gemeinschaft von Menschen mit ähnlichen Interessen oder Leidenschaften finden.Menschen streben nach Gemeinschaft und menschlicher Verbindung. Diese grundlegenden menschlichen Bedürfnisse, verschwinden auch in der digitalen Welt nicht. Und gerade in einer Welt, in der Inhalte, Bilder, Creatives und Texte von KI´s wie ChatGPT und Midjourney generiert werden. Gerade JETZT  ist es essenziell, den Menschen in den Mittelpunkt zu stellen und Gemeinschaft zu inszenieren, Menschen zusammenzubringen. Denn Online immer austauschbarer.Außerdem bieten Events die Möglichkeit, neue Menschen kennenzulernen und Beziehungen aufzubauen. Diese Beziehungen können in der digitalen Welt fortgesetzt werden, aber das Treffen von Menschen im wirklichen Leben schafft eine Verbindung, die anders ist als diejenige, die durch Online-Interaktionen entsteht. Und diese gemeinsamen Erlebnisse schaffen einzigartige Bindungen und Erinnerungen, die online schwer nachzubilden sind.Das Bedürfnis nach sozialer Interaktion und Gemeinschaft wird  weiterhin bestehen, unabhängig davon, wie sehr sich die Welt digitalisiert, wieviele neue KI-Tools entstehen. Der Mensch erkennt, dass Social Media nicht nur gut ist - wir starten also in die nächste Epoche.Also: Lasst uns Events kreieren, die Menschen zusammenzubringen und Menschen aufladen!",-0.9955,0.4000000000000001,2 ,4,0

Vadym Kuzmenko 👨🏻‍💻,15-03-2023,"One skill that could make you the most desired hire in 2023 🔥“This position is a bit hard to hire for”, writesAnthropicin its job advertisement, offering up to whopping 335.000 dollars per year. 💰 Who are they looking to hire? A prompt engineer - the profession of the future.What do prompt engineers do? 👩‍🔬Prompt engineers design effective prompts (inputs) that instruct Generative AI to produce desired responses of high quality. It involves defining the context, setting goals, selecting relevant datasets, and fine-tuning parameters to optimize the output. Basically, you manipulate what a Large Language Model does, instead of training your own (which is costly, believe me).Is there a demand for prompt engineers? 🤔#AIis currently a very hot topic, so it’s only natural that individuals who can make the most of AI tools are much in demand. To put this into perspective: “prompt engineering” searches on Google rose more than 5000% in the last few months! I also see more and more job offerings for prompt engineers arising, tempting with attractive salaries. So while most people just play around with ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney etc., some make it their career path. What is special is that it’s not limited to any field - be it#marketing,#salesor even#legal.What skills do I need to become a prompt engineer? ⚒Good news: you don’t necessarily have to be a data scientist. Or a software developer. All you need is to think analytically and creatively! And to be patient enough to go through hundreds of iterations to get to a desired solid prompt, of course.How can I learn#promptengineering? 📚Well, it’s a trial-and-error game. I would argue that one develops some kind of intuition about what a good prompt looks like. But there is also a growing number of different resources where you can read about how to write high-quality prompts. I’ll make sure to share my top 10 later.Do you agree that this could be the hottest job of 2023? Would you apply for a position atAnthropic?

Kate Xie,15-03-2023,"Can AI make better art than humans? It's an interesting questionArtificial intelligence has been infiltrating every industry and the world of arts and culture is no exception. In other words, AI art is poised to explode.AI text-to-image generators such as DALL-E or Midjourney have been creating remarkable visual artworks. ChatGPT has taken the world by the storm with its ability to answer questions, write essays, and summarize texts, among other things. AI-generated art is even being displayed at world-renowned museums.These examples show just how powerful generative AI can be and bid this pressing question: is AI about to replace human artists? It is a question worth thinking about.Seth Dobrin, IBM's first-ever Global Chief AI Officer, has an answer.AI-generated visual art already exists in various forms. There are examples of artists — such as Refik Anadol — who are the actual creators, but use artificial intelligence to augment their artworks. There are also tools like DALL-E which “are getting there,” although it's difficult to say whether their works are truly indistinguishable from humans'.Dobrin has a similar view on news articles, noting that financial news is already being automatically generated to an extent. And while he doesn't believe that AI-generated text is as engaging as a writer's would be, he explained that GPT-3 and Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate stories that journalists can use as a starting point.But when it comes to movies and novels, AI has a longer way to go. That's because “AI needs to truly learn emotion, really be able to simulate it, and invoke empathy — better than it can today,” Dobrin said. He expects five more years for novel creation, and between five to 10 years for movie production.But what's Dobrin's prediction on classical music? And does he believe that AI will merely augment humans in the creative process — or eventually replace them?You can watch the full interview to find out.#AIintelligence#AI#ChatGPT#artificialintelligence#OracleTranslation#manualtranslation#languagetranslation",0.9907,0.4346059113300492,0,0,0

During the developer Demo yesterday,Greg Brockman, President and Co-founder ofOpenAI, showed some of the use cases that will be possible using GPT 4. That includes:- The model can learn a completely new language (for him) in few seconds, only by reading the entire documentation of it.- It can quickly debug issues.- Read and understand images- Convert images into scriptsAll of this at an extremely fast speed.#GoogleWorkspace (former G-Suite):According to the video shared by Google yesterday, with the help of their machine learning algorithm (LaMDA) users now will be able to interact with its assistant by asking for things such as:- Summarize long e-mail threads and help you reply to them.- Create documents based on e-mails with only a few commands- Build an entire presentation with AI-generated media- Take meeting notes- Personalize messages using google sheets commands.And much more.I can't believe that we are still in March, and since the launch of ChatGPT in November, the technology started to evolve so fast.

This is especially true with creativity.If you are using an AI model just for general info, it is really useful (Provided it is UpToDate) in getting non-cluttered answer in simple terms. But even that answer can be inaccurate so you need to crosscheck against the reliable online sources.On creative ground, one can use it as 'sounding board' to bounce off your ideas and get the feedback. It can be useful in providing some base to push you ahead. Even while using this model, you need to be creative first as you need to ask the right question in right language in order to get a right answer!In the article, renowned cognitive scientist Noam Chomsky says,""However useful these programs may be in some narrow domains, there is no way that ML as it is today could compete with the human mind…""What do you say…?#ai#data#content#creative#creativity#language",0.9846,0.508296130952381,0,1,0

Nick Vince,15-03-2023,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing technology that can revolutionise the way your business operates. From automating daily tasks to providing customers with dynamic recommendations based on their data, AI provides the tools necessary to take your business to the next level. AI can also be used to improve customer experience and satisfaction by anticipating customer needs and responding quickly and accurately to customer queries.However, there is still a lot of confusion about the overall role of AI. One area that is considered problematic is that of AI-generated content. Using AI to write content for your website or the web is often frowned upon. Businesses are unsure about the ways it can be used.Danny Sullivan and Chris Nelson of Google’s Search Quality team clarified Google’s position on using AI-generated content in a recent blog post. They commented that it doesn’t matter how you create content, just as long as it is helpful to the user and follows Google’s E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) guidance.What is not tolerated is the use of AI to raise the position or status of a business by influencing search rankings to its advantage, something that Google has strict policies on. What we do know is that AI is here to stay and if used correctly, it can assist your business and customers very richly with its rewards.If you're interested in developing well-optimised quality content for your website then we'd love to hear from you.☎  0777 172 3144📧info@unityseo.co.uk#seooptimisation#seooptimization#smallbusinesssupportuk#seokeywords#smallbusinessnorfolk#smallbusinessnorwich#newbusiness#artificialintelligence#chatgpt#business#ai",0.9661,0.4634615384615385,0,1,0

Letícia Tainara Souza,15-03-2023,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, histórico de tendências e evoluções, aqui vão algumas das tendências de marketing para 2023:🤳🏻 Marketing de influência: o marketing de influência chegou pra ficar e continuará a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conteúdo para alcançar públicos específicos (Ó a base da Virginia aí, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).🎁 Personalização: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experiência personalizada e relevante, e as empresas estão investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estratégias para atender a essa demanda.📼 Vídeo marketing: o vídeo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produção de vídeo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Então investe nisso. A era dos estáticos morreu).🔊 Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas estão começando a adotar estratégias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personalização também).📩 Marketing de conteúdo: este continuará a desempenhando um papel importante na construção de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom! Se você é um profissional da área, sugiro começar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estratégias e tomadas de decisão. Pois como diz a famosa música de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por aí, ""hoje é um novo dia, de um novo tempo que começou.

Absax Technologies,15-03-2023,"OpenAIhas unveiledGPT AI-4, the latest iteration of its large language model which powers various applications including ChatGPT and the newly launched Bing. The San Francisco-based research firm asserts thatGPT AI-4 is more sophisticated and has been trained on more data than its predecessor, making it more expensive to operate.According toOpenAI, the latest model is highly innovative and collaborative, enabling it to tackle complex problems with greater precision. GPT-4 can assist users in generating, editing, and iterating on both creative and technical writing tasks, and is also equipped to interpret images in addition to text.GPT AI, @google,OpenAIhttps://lnkd.in/g2MbDGRH#ai#data#research#creative#writing#writing#google#writing#language",0.883,0.6114448051948052,0,1,0

Kris Laermans,15-03-2023,"Hey there! Did you hear the news? GPT4 has just been released! It's an evolution of ChatGPT based on GPT3.5, which you may already know. But this new version is even better. It allows you to be more demanding with the constraints of your questions. For instance, you can ask for each word of the answer to begin with a specific letter or tailor the answer to a targeted audience. Plus, it can take into account important content like documents of several dozen pages and answer specific questions or even make calculations based on the rules of the document.Advantage of the technologyBut wait, what is generative AI, you might ask? Well, it won't make you an expert in any domain, but it can help you become more creative by generating unique content such as music, art, and text that you may not have thought of otherwise. This can lead to new and innovative ideas and products. Plus, it can help you be more efficient by analyzing vast amounts of data and generating insights and predictions quickly, saving you time and reducing costs.Risks of not using itHowever, not using this technology today only limits the productivity potential of your company. It's like having a below-average assistant working for you for free. And who knows what the future holds? The skills of these AIs may grow to something we can't even imagine.Use casesSo, what are some use cases for Elia Group? Well, like any other company, generative AI can be used to help with writing articles, emails, and document research. But with the possibility to inject more content and provide more constraints in the questions, it could open doors to use cases such as engineering calculations based on internal documents by asking to explain each step to be checked afterward by an expert.Who is working on it?Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and many startups are all diving into this exciting technology.Do you have any ideas for using generative AI?

Conversely, Google is a search engine that fetches information relevant to a query from billions of web pages.📌Advantages and Limitations Of ChatGPT Compared To Google:🔷Advantages📍The primary appeal of ChatGPT is its human-like response. It’s like talking to an actual expert.📍Another advantage of ChatGPT is the precise nature of the responses.📍 Code debugging is also a glittering feature of ChatGPT that is hard to overlook.📍ChatGPT can double up as a virtual assistant.📍ChatGPT can adjust responses based on a slight variation in the text prompts.🔷Limitations📍One major downside of ChatGPT is that it’s limited by the data.📍ChatGPT has serious accuracy issues.📍ChatGPT cannot access the Internet.📍ChatGPT sometimes lacks variation in the provided replies.📍ChatGPT won’t be free forever?📌Advantages And Limitations Of Google Compared To ChatGPT:🔷Advantages📍Google has a massive database with all the latest information.📍Google offers you multiple avenues to seek the most suitable answer.📍 Google is capable of offering real-time information.📍Google particularly excels in offering personalized results.📍Google is Free.🔷Limitations📍Google is a search engine and doesn’t have the same language processing capabilities as ChatGPT.📍Google doesn’t act as an AI-powered virtual assistant.",0.97,0.4511904761904762,0,0,0

Falcon LLM 40B model is trained on one trillion tokens.According to TII, the model uses only 75 percent of OpenAI GPT-3’s training compute, 40 percent of Chinchilla’s (an LLM developed byDeepMind), and 80 percent of PaLM-62B’s (developed byGoogle). This superior performance is due to Falcon LLM's state-of-the-art data pipeline. The model was kept relatively modest in size with unprecedented data quality.Over the past 3-4 months, OpenAI's chatGPT3 has famously and very publically demonstrated the ability of large language models to generate text, create computer code and solve complex problems.

Aziz Ullah,15-03-2023,"Some interesting facts aboutChatGPT AIthat are worth sharing 😲👉 ChatGPT is a language model that uses deep learning to understand and generate natural language text.👉 It was trained on a massive amount of data, including books, articles, and websites, and is capable of answering questions, completing sentences, and even generating original text.👉 ChatGPT was trained using a neural network architecture called a transformer, which was first introduced in a research paper by Google in 2017. The transformer architecture has since become the standard for training large language models.👉 The original version of ChatGPT, known as GPT-1, was released in 2018. Since then, several updated versions of the model have been released, with each iteration improving upon the previous one.👉 ChatGPT has been used for a wide range of applications, including language translation, text completion, and even generating art and music. It has also been used to develop virtual assistants and chatbots.👉 Despite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT is not without its limitations. It can sometimes generate text that is nonsensical or even offensive, and it has been criticized for perpetuating biases and stereotypes that exist in the data it was trained on.👉 Overall, ChatGPT is a fascinating example of the power of deep learning and natural language processing, and it will be interesting to see how it continues to be developed and applied in the years to come.FollowAziz Ullahfor more interesting facts 🤗#artificialintelliegence#chatgptai#chatgpt4",0.9652,0.4381987577639752,1 ,1,0
Ishan Kumar Giddu,15-03-2023,"AI has understood that multi-sensory engagement is as necessary as (if not more than) text.CTO of Microsoft Germany, Andreas Braun says that GPT-4 will be arriving within the next few days. GPT-4 will be the upgraded version of the GPT-3 language model that runs the current trailblazer ChatGPT.But what could be the difference? Multimodality.The word is heavy but the meaning is relatively simpler - Multimodal AI means artificial intelligence that can accept inputs, read, comprehend, and produce results in text as well as images, video and sound.If integrated in GPT-4, this could be the superior model of Google Image Search or Google Voice Search.While the rumours of GPT-4 having 100 trillion parameters or data points (for comparison, GPT-3 has 175 billion) may have been dispelled by Sam Altman, there’s no doubt that GPT-4 will have to be based on a much larger data set than its predecessor to be able to give visual outputs and to do so accurately.Accuracy will be a priority because pictures and video are visual elements that are taken in with much more keenness and scrutiny.If successful in integrating multimodality in its model, then I am sure that GPT-4 will bring in ‘NexGen content’ - content of all forms that has been developed with the collaboration of man and machine. A hint at this is Holger Kenn, Direct of Business Strategy at Microsoft Germany, saying that GPT-4 could assist call centres by automatically converting phone conversations to text and summarising them.GPT-4 could mean quick text prompts creating entire video storyboards, or picture inputs developing an in-depth video structure. It may also mean super-speedy infographics for business meetings, or quick meeting minutes extracted from a video recording - the benefits are truly far reaching!What do you think will be the best use-case of the multimodal GPT-4?#chatgpt4#gpt4#nlp#artificialintelligence#future",0.9913,0.5145555555555557,0,19,0

As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom! Se você é um profissional da área, sugiro começar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estratégias e tomadas de decisão. Pois como diz a famosa música de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por aí, ""hoje é um novo dia, de um novo tempo que começou. Todos os nossos sonhos, serão verdade e o futuro já começou"".#marketing#tecnologia#amazon#empresas#salesforce#marketingsensorial#marketing2023#marketingderelacionamento",-0.3956,1.0,3 ,6,0
