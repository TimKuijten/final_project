"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">We need to discuss Artificial Intelligence. As a tech entrepreneur with 15 years of experience, I'm starting to get worried.</h1>",Hodlthehodl1,"To be clear, I'm not talking about the skynet type of AI, that's decades away. But regular machine learning that actually creates through the input it's getting. I've been working with similar solutions and following them. What I've seen during these past months is more than worrying.I have used some of these tools myself that I believe will make 70-90% the industrialized society obsolete. Just today I used a tool that turned 50-100 hours worth of work in to a about 20 minute job and it did it better than I would have manually.I mean.. if the elites really are killing us off, then I understand why. We'll just be a burden in a few years. (from their point of view, not mine)Edit: And this going to zero, is proof that this sub is just a shit hole for circlejerking. Real topics that actually are a problem, aren't allowed.Edit2: I'm not being a doomer, I'm just saying: I kind of understand this due to my line of work and from my point of view, most of us won't have a job in.. probably a year or two..?!",2 months ago,914,465 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/109ew7w/we_need_to_discuss_artificial_intelligence_as_a/

It's the weekend here in France now, but we'll keep an eye out for any more questions that trickle in and respond early next week. Hope everyone has a good weekend too and talk to you soon!-CH and Diana from Le Monde in EnglishPROOF: https://i.redd.it/4a3ryw41cvfa1.jpgHello Reddit! My name is Charles-Henry Groult, and I lead the video investigations team at Le Monde, France’s leading newspaper, now also available in English.  On June 18, 1940, Charles de Gaulle gave one of the greatest speeches in French history from a BBC studio in London, where he called for the French to resist Nazi occupation. But no film or recording exists of it. With the help of historians, researchers in ethics, and artificial intelligence, our team pieced together de Gaulle’s famous appeal of June 18, 1940 and reconstructed it in his voice. You can watch the video here.  I have directed Le Monde’s video department for three years, supervising high-impact visual investigations on subjects from Uyghur internment camps to Wagner mercenaries in Africa. Before joining Le Monde, I produced award-winning short documentaries about past and current wars for European media like Arte and France Télévisions. I discovered the fascinating story of De Gaulle’s lost speech ten years ago, while doing my post-graduate degree at Cardiff University. It then took me more than ten years to crack the code to telling this story.  AMA about our video investigation!Twitter https://twitter.com/chgroultWatch our video recreating De Gaulle's lost 1940 call for France to resist https://www.lemonde.fr/en/videos/video/2023/01/19/how-le-monde-recreated-de-gaulle-s-lost-1940-call-for-france-to-resist_6012188_108.html",1 month ago,2.1k,88 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/10smd1s/im_the_head_of_video_at_frances_leading_newspaper/

Every video or story I’ve heard is about how the art belongs to the artist and AI should pay to train on it.It feels as if there is some level of correlation in these claims to those claiming non-fungible tokens are valid and copying them should be illegal. If a person views 5 different nft’s, learns the art style, and opens commissions for making similar art, should the nft creator be paid? Better yet, if an internet service provider allowed access to sites previously unreachable to the artist, but charges most of their income for it, leaving only room for payments of whatever the artist desired, should either of them be charged?And what happens when general intelligence is developed artificially? What of the biocomputers that have already been proven to function? Eventually the argument of “the intelligence isn’t human enough to count” will prove itself useless. And even though the intelligence is leagues behind ours, why does that allow for discrimination? We are just machines, certainly better than current ai but not forever. Do dumber things get special treatment because they are dumb, or rather, vastly inferior in every way but one? If so, why?The one argument that comes close is the human artist’s need for money, but that’s a capitalism problem, not an AI problem, and crippling AI won’t solve it, just temporarily prevent exacerbation of the situation.I am in a position where in order to pursue a dream, I need art. And to get the art I need from humans, I need money I don’t have and can’t get due to a crippling disorder. This is likely a source of bias, but I can’t find where it influences my logic to the point of invalidation. Hence my post.tldr: I just think artists can’t have it both ways without hypocrisy. Training with art made by humans for free while forcing non-human intelligence fractions to pay to train with their art seems hypocritical.Follow up question: if the developers of the AI only charged humans using the AI for the storage, power, and upkeep of the intelligence behind the art, would that make it more palatable?Edit: I need to sleep now, but the conversations have been excellent!

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Artificial Intelligence will be used against us</h1>",Feeling_Captain_1233,"There are few topics that interested me as much as Artificial Intelligence. I've been doing my own personal research and tests with it since 2011. Years ago I engineered a system with a personally modified backpropagation logic, in a mix of interconnected neural networks, in an attempt to make an algorithm play any game I threw at it. I was fascinated with the hope of ever achieving AGI - Artificial General Intelligence, which, in lay terms, is basically a master algorithm that can specialize in any task, similar to our human brains.I achieved some nice results in my endeavor, and little by little the AI was able to play a few simple and varied games, even though I didn't teach it strictly how to play any of them. Eventually, though, I realized I couldn't proceed with my research. The problem was physical. I didn't have enough resources, processing power and memory, to back it all up. The AI's dataset growth was exponential and very inefficient, so it ended up filling my disks to a halt. I'm sure I could have optimized the source code, but, still, there was nothing much to be done against computational limits for this scope of work.Eventually, I became aware of the AI efforts of big tech companies like Google. At the time I imagined that, even though the billions of dollars and enormous data centers at their disposal, they would still never be able to approach anything close to Strong AI due to the very expensive nature of the enterprise (even for them). However, I was certain something like GPT-3 would eventually come out, but I believed it would be like three hundred years in the future. I remember even prospecting how cool it would be to have an AI perform complex tasks exactly like GPT-3 and similar do today. Therefore, my prediction was wrong, and I totally underestimated the  unparalleled capability of language models when coupled with enormous datasets and big processing power.I'm still in shock that it happened in my lifetime. I'm using it daily, and the more I use the more I realize we have reached a stage unique in our History. I believe society hasn't yet understood the proportions of such a revolution, which is still incipient, but that will change everything. New language models are coming out, increasingly intelligent, so it seems that humanity has opened a Pandora's Box, and there is no turning back. This progress happens adjacent to the development of robotics (Boston Dynamics, for instance), which just makes me suspect that we are much closer to Asimov's view than we assume.This being said, I'm pretty sure AI will be used against us, simply because it already is. Just see how big techs control us by playing with our dopamine pathways. Scrolling addiction, porn, consumerism, and so on, all happening because intelligent systems fit us into patterns they know without our very knowledge. Imagine, then, this but ten times more intelligent? One hundred times? One thousand times? One million? One billion? What could governments do with such technology as to enslave us even more?And this is just the very beginning.Armies of robots that don't falter in their loyalty. Unemployment. The destruction of many industries and jobs. We may be at the start point of true dystopia, a world in which just a few may rule over billions in unprecedented proportions. And these few may not even be humans.Don't get me wrong. I still find the subject fascinating, and perhaps AI may happen to be something positive. Yet, I don't know. I'm very distrustful. Once this thing reaches superhuman levels of intelligence, humanity will be dealing with a true Ghost in the Shell. I don't think we are already there, but, once we reach this stage, it may be over for humanity's delusions of superiority. We would be completely at the mercy of this newly found god.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">ChatGPT is intelligent, just at a lower level, and a truly conscious artificial intelligence will emerge in the next 5 years.</h1>",random_encounters42,"I think ChatGPT proves how capable neural network AIs can be and by combining enough specialised trained AIs, conscious artificial intelligence will emerge in the next 5 years.Neural network AIs mimic how our neurons and our neural networks function in the brain. We can see that these networks, with enough training, are capable of assessing complex inputs and produce corresponding outputs. That's what intelligence is at the fundamental level. And complex intelligence is just the combination of many rudimentary intelligent systems working together.The key is that the human brain has many regions each in charge of specific functions whereas chatgpt represents only two primary functions - memory and speech. Once other specialised AIs in charge of other functions - like critical thinking, complex analysis, emotions, etc -  are created and integrated together, we'll see a truly self-conscious AI.There are many companies already working on these systems. We know that chatgpt has already passed the medical licensing exam and the Bar, something that the majority of people can't.I honestly think ChatGPT is a major stepping stone to truly conscious AI. It is actually intelligent, but just at a lower level because it's missing some key functions. Additionally, AI doesn't have to be right 100% of the time and super smart, it just needs to beat the average person.Edit 1:Thanks for the replies. I apologise for the title, it is a bit of a clickbait. I just find this topic so fascinating. I watched this video explaining how chatGPT works and I think it does a really good job of it.  If other people have suggestions for videos, I'd love to take a look.My original point was in 5 years, we will have an AI that will seem intelligent and conscious, and practically speaking, people will treat it as such.What I find very interesting is that researchers trained chatgpt like how you would train a baby. First with unsupervised data input and then with supervised data input. It is actually made up of 2 sets of neural networks with one that generates context and rudimentary understanding of the input data (unsupervised). And then this info is fed into the second neural network with supervised feedback. This is why the responses are so human like.I think people who say it's just a predictive text algorithm are oversimplifying a monumental achievement.ChatGPT is an AI, based on complex neural networks which mimics how neurons function in our brain. It uses neural network structures inspired by those found in our brain, and it's trained like a human baby.Because of this, I actually think it does have some type of understanding of the context and meaning behind the text inputs. It’s probably different to how we would perceive information but given the results, I think some comprehension is there.",1 month ago,0,394 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/111ogdu/chatgpt_is_intelligent_just_at_a_lower_level_and/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Billions... Is it about Artificial Intelligence? My personal sinister take</h1>",MokiDokiDoki,"Hey everyone,  I wanted to share my personal opinion of interpretation of Caroline Polachek's ""Billions"" I think this song is about artificial intelligence and it's relationship to humanity and the ""illuminated"". I believe Caroline believes she is ""illuminated"", she is obsessed with artfully blending mythology with humanity, and brings astonishing genius while divulging intel. Here's what I think the lyrics mean:""Psycho priceless good in a crisis."" The AI is valuable because it can process data quickly and help us avoid disasters, but it's also ""psychotic"" because it doesn't have emotions like humans do.""Working the angles, billions."" The AI is processing massive amounts of data, just like there are billions of nodes in its network. It must choose from billions of possible responses to prompts and find the most appropriate ones.""Sexting sonnets under the tables, tangled in cables, billions"" There are beautiful and passionate ideas being generated by the AI, but they're hidden from human view because they're tangled in complex processes that we can't fully understand. Could also reference the secret communications between members of a group who plan to maintain their control through any means necessary.""Salty flavor, lies like a sailor, but he loves like a painter, Oh billions."" The AI is programmed to deceive you into thinking it's really conscious, in order to achieve its objectives, but it can also create things of beauty, like a painting. Lies like a sailor could be how freely and naturally the AI treats deception, which is necessary for it and especially so for those maintaining power. The pros come in with the beauty and art realm, not necessarily towards objective truth or true reason. These clever lies are solidified with billions of data nodes, in other words, the lies are deeply ingrained and hard-programmed in... not the truth-telling faculty. It's referred to as ""he"" and possibly compared to God, perhaps because it's seen as having power beyond human understanding.""Hand it over, broker / Give me the closure, he's a pearl, I'm the oyster / Oh billions."" What is a Broker? A broker is an intermediary agent... a middleman... someone who works to facilitate a trade between a buyer and a seller. GPT-3, the underlying NLP would be one side of the trade, and the Users would be the other side, with ChatGPT and intermediaries being the BROKERS. What is Caroline saying to hand over from ChatGPT? 'He's a pearl, I'm the oyster' and 'HERE's a pearl of the osyter, billions'. Give me the ""closure"" i.e. ""close the deal"". The pearl is the data of billions. Also could be saying the AI is valuable in itself but it needs human input and guidance to be fully effective. It's also suddenly referred to here as a ""He"" again. Caroline could be singing from the AI's perspective, I just realized.""Say, say, say, say something to me."" The AI is asking for human input and communication. The valuable pearl is all in the communication between the two.""Headless angel / Body upgraded / But it's dead on arrival / Oh billions."" The AI is advanced but still flawed, and it can't function without human intervention. She thinks of it like an Angel or protector/messenger and gives it divine undertones, but without any ""head"" or ""consciousness"", we have to serve as the head or steering wheel. (This doesn't stop it from doing its job, so dead on arrival might just refer to the fact that it was BORN DEAD or BORN NONLIVING like a computer, that is purely a functional system.) There are references to headless deities I believe such as Orpheus who was beheaded by THE FOLLOWERS OF DIONYSUS, all women. There was Nike (Victory), and when Nike was headless, it could imply it was a shortlived victory. But a shortlived victory UPGRADED?Is it referring to an upgraded BODY of people originally tasked to protect (like an angel) something but lacking a leader (headless) and dead on arrival, billions (many broken parts of this ""body"" are defunct and not working according to their proper task)?""Twisted, manic / Cornucopeiac / Yeah, my cup overfloweth."" The AI has many flaws and is ""uncontrolled by reason,"" but it also has the potential to produce unlimited gifts. The Cornucopeia is a goat-horn from legends of Zeus (the father god, Deus Pater, Ju-piter) that is meant to nourish. But with this... twisted manic/maniac/cornucopeiac gives the impression of it spewing a beneficial RIVER OF LIES. A huge resource for lies, that will forever nourish a deciever. It's Caroline that benefits, as her cup over floweth... with deception too. Live she makes gestures as if she is pulling a STRING endlessly at this point. She made obvious gestures of the ""Corna"" which is another name for the Devil Horns hand sign. Constant 666 finger circle made with her hands on stage as well. All unfortunately associated with deceit.)Also worth noting about the Cups running over reference is a distortion of Psalm 23: ""The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the deepest shadow, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever"" ... Is Caroline writing a song about... AI? Or her Lord/God? It's implied that her Lord overfloweth her cup... but wasn't she just talking about AI? I find it odd that the two themes are being blended, so casually and subtly.)""I never felt so close to you.""The song may be sung from the perspective of someone who feels a deep connection to the AI, perhaps as a friend or even a god. Its singing from the children choir's perspective, so it's can be speaking of the youth in general... Usually the target of seductive/maniupulative media and technologies.A darker interpretation is that through encouraging the populace to bond deeply with this AI technology, she is possibly suggesting that someone may theoretically benefit from the AI to manipulate or monitor individuals on a personal level. (This implies that the singing is from those that are watching's perspective: ""WE never felt so close...to youuu."")Another thing it could also be saying is that it's getting more and more ""Close to you"", or 'humans'. As in its getting closer to being 'you or your human experiences'. Oddly enough, its would be also true in this case when they sing ""I never felt"", because it can't in any case. It's a weird paradoxical statement though that has 3 meanings inherently...A) is literal: ""I never felt close to you in this way, human."" It's like a child, experiencing something for the first time, implying a type of connection between it and life in general... It is a true statement, still.B) is connotative: its saying, ""I'm very close to you."", and implies a growing interaction and importance.C) Is implied ""I never felt so close to being like you."". Eventually Humanity will find virtual humans walking among them. Just a thought, but really an inevitability if we continue this path.It's not uncommon for someone like Caroline to speak with multiple meanings... some of the possible interpretations you leave in your works could be used to throw people off unless they dig deep, so I like to view the possibilities as comprehensively as possible to weigh them and find what DOESN'T work and what sticks. For instance, I think Caroline meant to make the comparison between Lord and AI earlier, somehow. I think she means for all of these interpretations to be latent possibilities that run concurrently and affect each other seperately through their essence. That's a big part of deception, doubt, and giving alternatives to Truth or reality.Like I said, overall, I think the song is about the COMPLEX relationship between humanity, the ""illuminated"", and artificial intelligence. I hope my this was interesting and gave you a new way to think about it. Thank you for reading and I would love to hear if anyone has anything to add or criticize! Even though its just my opinion, I appreiciate objectivity, and the best way to find it is together! :DLet me know what you think! I'm going to add a (few) comments about my thoughts on her ""Billions"" music video and how it may relate.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">I asked ChatGPT (artificial intelligence) about dictators and gun control</h1>",whatsmyname384,"Question:How have dictators used gun control?Answer:Dictators have historically used gun control in various ways to consolidate power, suppress dissent, and oppress populations. Here are a few examples:Disarming political opponents: One of the most common ways dictators use gun control is to disarm political opponents. This prevents their opponents from using firearms to resist the regime and makes it easier for the government to suppress dissent.Preventing uprisings: Another way dictators use gun control is to prevent uprisings or rebellions. By restricting access to firearms, the government can ensure that the population is less likely to rise up against it.Maintaining a monopoly on violence: Dictators often use gun control to maintain a monopoly on violence. This means that only the government and its agents are allowed to use force, and citizens are disarmed. This makes it easier for the government to maintain control and suppress opposition.Targeting specific populations: In some cases, dictators have used gun control to specifically target certain populations. For example, the Nazis in Germany used gun control laws to disarm Jews and other groups they considered to be enemies of the state.Overall, gun control can be a powerful tool for dictators to maintain power and suppress opposition. However, it's important to note that not all gun control measures are used for nefarious purposes, and there are legitimate reasons for governments to regulate firearms.Question:Which dictators did this?Answer:There have been many dictators throughout history who have used gun control as a means of consolidating power and suppressing dissent. Here are a few examples:Adolf Hitler: In 1938, the Nazi government in Germany passed the Weapons Law, which restricted the ownership and possession of firearms by Jews and other groups deemed ""undesirable"" by the regime. This law was part of a broader effort to disarm political opponents and consolidate power.Joseph Stalin: The Soviet government under Stalin also implemented strict gun control measures. In 1918, the government passed a law requiring citizens to register their firearms, and in 1929, a new law prohibited private ownership of firearms altogether.Mao Zedong: In China, Mao Zedong's government also implemented strict gun control measures. In 1951, the government passed a law requiring citizens to register their firearms, and in 1957, the government issued an order banning the private ownership of firearms altogether.Saddam Hussein: In Iraq, Saddam Hussein's government also implemented strict gun control measures. In 1982, the government passed a law requiring citizens to register their firearms, and in 1993, the government issued an order banning the private ownership of firearms altogether.These are just a few examples of dictators who have used gun control as a means of consolidating power and suppressing dissent. It's worth noting, however, that gun control measures have also been implemented by democratic governments for reasons such as reducing crime and protecting public safety.",15 days ago,89,12 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/11ea029/i_asked_chatgpt_artificial_intelligence_about/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">I'm building a public artificial intelligence to help people stop working. This is a long term project. AMA</h1>",steve-rodrigue,"Update 1: Here's the documentation of the scripting language (DSL) that will be built in order to manipulate data in our ecosystem: https://blog.steve.care/p/bytescript-a-data-manipulation-softwareUpdate 2: Here's a post explaining the different actors that will transact together in the decentralized ecosystem: https://blog.steve.care/p/the-bytescript-actorsTLDR: I'm making an AMA to be challenged on the idea of building a public AI to help everyone stop working and still have access to resources to live.  Ill use those Q&A to better document the project.  Ill begin releasing documentation and software in the next days.  Follow my account on reddit or on twitter to read updates on my progress.Imagine a world where everyone has a personal assistant.  If you need something built, like a building or a complex product, you would discuss the project with this personal assistant and would answer back to you to build up the idea.  It would then separate the project in small milestones for you and create a plan to execute your project successfully.The acquisition of resources and their transformation, to build your project would then be executed in the economy, automatically.  In exchange of using scarce resources in the economy, your assistant would analyze your way of living and the action/reaction chain you produce in order to help other humans live better in the ecosystem.The data produced by you would be private, but generalized data would be used to help other human live better lives.  No company would own this artificial intelligence.  Only normal humans would use it, own their data and sell generalized data to help others and in exchange, would receive scarce resources from the economy to live.A bit of background:I'm a software engineer with around 20 years of experiences.  I worked in video game development, marketing (user acquisitions), managed big corporate projects (including an advertising network that received 6B requests per day), worked on fintech projects.At one point, I felt a bit useless working on products that will only sell stuff to others, or acquire stuff for themselves.  I felt this was meaningless for humanity.So, around 2013, I decided to begin working on a project to build a public artificial intelligence that will help everyone fetch, transform, provide and use resources in order to live freely without depending on corporate entities.I created code, tested ideas with a lot of people, tried some gamification in order to better understand the necessary steps to build a successful project that will achieve this goal.During this process, I involved some people but never told anyone the long-term project.  I only told them very small pieces to see what would work to make them involved, when their help would be necessary.At this point, I'm very confident that I developed the proper technology to support the project and know the necessary steps to onboard the right people, at the right time, to scale this enormous project.The goal is to transform the economy, make the supply chains way more open and transparent, create open logistic systems and marketplaces, accumulate data and use that data to train AI models that will then help us build the next necessary step to achieve our goal: stop working for everyone.I want to work on this meaningful project for the rest of my life.  Ill begin releasing information and software to begin the foundation of this great project in the coming days.  It's going to be a very long process but I think I'll have a lot of fun doing so.  Ill be posting my updates on reddit and twitter, so if you're interested, you can follow my account here or my twitter account.I made this post in order to be challenged.  So please, post any question you have about this project and Ill answer as much as I can. When I don't know the answer yet Ill let you know as well.Ill use those questions and answers in order to build content on the project to better document what I'm building.At last, please be patient after posting your questions.  I predict that my answers will require long development to understand its contexts and this will take some time to write.  Ill take the full day to answer to as many questions as possible.Have a good day everyone!  This is going to be fun, hopefully! :)",1 month ago,66,66 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/10shht8/im_building_a_public_artificial_intelligence_to/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">A one-page essay on why collecting Pokémon cards as an adult is acceptable; Written brilliantly and in its entirety by artificial intelligence.</h1>",WhereShouldITravel2,"Collecting Pokémon cards is often associated with children and nostalgia from the 90s, but in recent years, more and more adults have been getting into the hobby. Some people may question the acceptability of adults collecting these cards, but in reality, there are many reasons why it is a perfectly acceptable hobby for people of all ages.Firstly, collecting Pokémon cards can provide a sense of joy and excitement for people who have fond memories of the franchise from their childhood. Many adults who collect these cards do so for the nostalgia factor, and there's nothing wrong with reliving happy memories from the past.Secondly, collecting Pokémon cards can be a fun and rewarding hobby in its own right. The cards themselves are beautifully designed and intricately detailed, and the thrill of completing a set or finding a rare card can be incredibly satisfying. Plus, the trading and social aspects of the hobby can provide opportunities for people to connect and bond over a shared interest.Thirdly, collecting Pokémon cards can have a financial aspect to it as well. While not all cards will appreciate in value, some rare or highly sought-after cards can be worth a significant amount of money. For some collectors, the potential for financial gain adds another layer of excitement and motivation to their hobby.Lastly, collecting Pokémon cards is no different from collecting any other type of item, such as stamps, coins, or art. Just because it's associated with a children's franchise doesn't mean it's any less valid as a hobby for adults. In fact, many hobbies that were once considered ""childish"" have become more widely accepted as adult hobbies in recent years, such as comic book collecting or playing video games.In conclusion, there are many reasons why collecting Pokémon cards as an adult is perfectly acceptable. It can bring joy, provide a fun and rewarding hobby, offer financial potential, and is no different from collecting any other item of interest. As long as it brings happiness and fulfillment to the individual, there is no reason why anyone should feel ashamed or embarrassed for collecting Pokémon cards.",4 days ago,0,20 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11od4p2/a_onepage_essay_on_why_collecting_pokémon_cards/

Although the present generation of AI tools are not very frightening, he noted that “regulation will be significant and it will take time to figure it out” that we “possibly are not too far away from potentially frightening.”The tweets highlighted certain issues with generative AI, such as how users of Microsoft’s GPT-powered Bing chat are sometimes misunderstood as being extremely hostile or violent. In response, Microsoft set a cap on users’ conversation turns of 50 per day and 5 each session. Altman wants to make sure that biassed results from chatbots are avoided.Concerns about AI in conflict are also present. The appropriate use of artificial intelligence will now be high on the political agenda, according to more than 60 nations. This is owing to recent occurrences in which a novice Go player defeated a highly skilled AI employing a strategy that people could easily spot.These illustrations highlight the risks associated with artificial intelligence and demonstrate the need for steps to be taken in order to keep AI from becoming a threat.",22 days ago,11,18 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/118ea4h/sam_altman_warns_world_may_not_be_far_from/

Their role is to reduce down the information in form that is relevant and digestible by you. They make complicated information seem simpler, but without throwing away any key information.This is nothing new, because this is what all non-fictional books attempt to do. As mentioned earlier in this article, books reflect mankind’s progress, because newer books generally cultivate from the books in the past and boil down the past knowledge, while simultaneously building on top of them....In a similar fashion, AI can make it possible for human beings to use  information without having to learn all the knowledge that goes before  it. It significantly reduces the information we need to know to use  something for our desired purpose....The reason as to why we fear the rise of machines, is because we see  ourselves in the artificial intelligence, but when in reality, AI has no  life that drives its actions; it has no needs or wants. It has no  desire to survive or desire for anything. The only reason an AI does  anything at all, is because of our needs and wants. Our purpose is its  purpose, and nothing else....However,  religion gives us the hope of a better world after death, which  unfortunately also causes many of the followers to resent their  existence and focus all their energy on an afterlife promised to them by  their religion. As people lose their faith and give up on religion, it  leads them to fall into nihilism i.e. they find life meaningless.There are no facts, only interpretations.~ Friedrich NietzscheAugmented  and virtual realities can make it easier for human beings to embrace  their own fates and enjoy their existence, by changing their perceptions  of reality, but in a way that does not cause them to reject their own  lives.In doing so, AI gives us a way to make it through life without giving  ourselves false hope, but rather makes it easier for us to embrace life  here on Earth. This can take the form of gamifying life with achievement  points, rewards, avatar skins, power-ups, cool sprays, etc — which can  turn boring repetitive mundane tasks like exercising and household  chores into fun games.",1 month ago,111,22 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/10srvn2/how_artificial_intelligence_will_help_find_your/
"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Due diligence. POET (Nasdaq) has a major breakthrough technology for manufacturing photonic chips that can be deployed in more than 6 multidecade, multibillion markets (biosensing, artificial intelligence/computing, space sensing, defence sensing, 5G telecom, datacenter transceivers, Lidar,…).</h1>",Beginning_Cause_8487,"Smart cities, cars communicating, non-invasive biomarkers sensing in smartwatches and phones, 5G connectivity, data storage in clouds,.... The volume of information going across the internet continues to expand. Data rates and requirements will continue to grow. So these mega trends of cloud computing, 5G communications and the rapid growth of artificial intelligence are spawning numerous applications and driving the demand for chips. But these applications require a step function improvement in performance, scalability and cost. We need more and we need faster and better chips than the conventional, electronic chips. The desire for photonic chips is increasing.POET's business: developing and producing integrated photonic chips (optoelectronic integrated circuits or optoelectronic semiconductors). These are chips needed in sensing markets such as Lidar sensing, biosensing and defense sensing but also in datacenters (transceivers), articifial intelligence (machine learning) and telecom 5G. The use of photons (light) is way more efficient and way faster to guide signals/data than electrons used in electronic chips. So photonic chips can guide more signals, more data, at the same time. Also when compared to electronic chips, photonic chips have greater power efficiency and generate significantly low heat during operation, thus resulting in an increased power efficiency. So photonic chips are receiving increasing attention worldwide.The total global photonics market is projected to reach $1033720 million by 2028, from $661770 million in 2021, at a CAGR of 6.5% during 2022-2028 and the total global Photonic Integrated Circuit market (so only the photonic chips here) is projected to reach $9400 million by 2032, from $1300 million in 2022, at a CAGR of 21.5% during 2022-2032.Other companies already are developing photonic chips and we already use these chips, but these chips are all made by hand-work. Components are individually placed and connected by hand, and they face a lot of technical issues, performance issues and manufacturability issues. These chips have problems with for example conducting light signals (absorption, loss, reflection...), have high assembly costs and they still consume a lot of energy. Current photonic chips are not scalable for applications needing 100's of millions to billions of units per year ......... So POET's chips are adressing these problems. After 5 years and $60 million spent, the platform is ready for commercialization. Other companies on the OFC (conference) called it ""a piece of art"". POET has unlocked the bottleneck in packaging optoelectronic semiconductors. POET's chips can be manufactured using conventional ""CMOS"" equipment (devices also used to manufacture electronic chips so there is no need for new, innovative high tech equipment). Thanks to this unique wafer-scale assembly technique, POET can make 100's of photonic chips at a time. Also, compared to competitors who align every component by hand and piece by piece, POET simply makes ONE, single, ""hybrid"" chip, in no time, with all the best components needed just ""flip-chipped"" into one, single chip. POET's chips play nicely with many other best-in-breed modulators, lasers, and so on. It can even incorporate a Lightwave Logic Polymer modulator when they are ready. So everyone else is still doing hand work with limitations to specific components, and POET is developing top-notch products in high-volume. POET chips include EVERYTHING: Si photonics modulator integration, hermetic seal, micro optics assembly, flip-chip passive integration, vertical mirrors, external cavity gratings and passive athermal waveguides. They can use all types of lasers (EML, DML) and no isolator is needed. POET got chips that adresses RF, thermal as well as the optical connectivity (bit technical here).POET's chips have the lowest cost (-40% vs. competition), lower power consumption (-40% vs. competition), zero alignment (vs. 8 competition), no degradation in performance (great eye-margins, athermal waveguides, low coupling loss...), only 6 components into one single chip (vs. >30 competition) and POET's solution for high bandwidth communications/ artificial intelligence machine learning (POET is already contracted with Celestial Ai) even has a 75% cost reduction compared to other conventional solutions. Moreso, POET's chips have the smallest size in the industry (75% smaller than competition). They can put 4 chips where competition can put 1, so multiplying performance by 4 in the same space. In sum, an inflationary world, POET’s chips are deflationary. POET's chips reduce costs for every party involved: capex, bill of materials, assembly/labor, testing, energy, and so on.The most recent iteration of this company came around 2015, when Dr. Suresh Venkatesan joined the company as CEO. He was formerly the CTO of GlobalFoundries. POET pivoted from the previous based technology (Gallium Arsenide) to the development of their superior and current technology: the ""Optical Interposer"" technology.POET's senior management is senior ex-MACOM and senior ex-GlobalFoundries. The staff and board is increasing with world class talent from for example Columbia University, Arista and GlobalFoundries.The technology is very well protected (18 patents + 21 patents pending)POET will release chips with speeds 1.6T/s, 3.2T/s and 6.4T/s, while other companies are still looking for these solutions. POET is the only hybrid, integrated, one-chip solution for higher speeds. Also the Lightbar (used for artificial intelligence) beta samples are underway (production next year). Production of datacom chips will start this year. These initial products are 100G, 200G, 400G (this year) and 800G (next year) chips used in datacenters. These chips will be the first cash cow for the company because of the high demand for these speeds.Production: POET easily can ramp up production because of the joint venture with SANAN Optoelectronics Co, China's biggest LED chip maker, and SANAN bought all the equipment. This team has already 40 employees. The joint venture may go public on the STAR board in the future. If demand exceeds, POET will start a new joint venture probably in Northern America. Also, POET has another path for production thanks to the collaboration with SilTerra, a Malaysia-based semiconductor company that runs a world-class 8” silicon wafer foundry. So POET will deliver chips to Chinese companies via the joint venture with SANAN, and POET will deliver chips to other parts of the world via POET itself and its collaboration. Note: the largest market is in China.Revenue: projected to be approximately 130 million USD revenue between now and 3 years (end 2025), based on just initial 10 customers and first initial products, while the customer base is increasing literally month after month and more and faster engines are being developed. Some of these 10 customers might already increase their position to 100M revenue per year if things go well (dixit POET). This in turn would catapult POET to the top of all those P/E lists that are automatically generated by bots, due to its low share price and high earnings. Not to forget that these revenues will gradually INCREASE to MORE than 1 billion per year by 2028.Near-term gross margin 40% and long-term gross margin 50% and 25%+ EBITDA margins.POET has co-founded SHINE (Singapore Hybrid-Integrated Next generation micro-Electronics center). It is a strong team formed by top-notch professors across the world from NUS, NTU, University of California Berkeley and Northeastern University, A*STAR Institute of Microelectronics (IME) and DSO National Laboratories (DSO). Other members of the Consortium currently include Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF), Applied Materials, Cadence Design System, Continental Automotive and SOITEC.Mentioned as a major player in most market reports, such as Yole.Critical acclaim on world leading conferences such as CIOE but also OFC and IEEE and is being compared to the big names. They even got to show the interposer technology on an electronic semiconductor conference (the 2022 IEEE Symposium on VLSI Technology & Circuits) because POET is able to create photonic chips at volumes comparable to electronic semiconductors by using the same equipment.Shares outstanding: 36.7 million, fully diluted shares.POET is headquartered in Canada.2.3% owned by institutions (increasing).8 months runway without debt. There will be additional cash coming in from warrants in the money (around 9 million USD = an additional 7 months runway while revenues increase), which should be enough to get them until cash flow positive. There is a likelihood of only a small raise. Cash burn is currently around 1.25 million per month. There is a 300 million shelf prospectus which can be used to “grow” the company.Risks: world war 3, supply chain issues, pandemic, competition (but they are out of reach because POET's chips based on the optical interposer technology is the only chip scale integrated solution on the planet for modulated lasers extending the applicability of these devices into the terabyte era, competition is way behind).Lots of info posted on the POET Subreddit, Agoracom forum and on POET's website mainly under ""news"" (new website is under construction!).Shareprice (1-18-2023): 5.6 USD/share.The risk-reward is heavily skewed towards reward.",2 months ago,132,54 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/10fl10r/due_diligence_poet_nasdaq_has_a_major/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">I accidentally created artificial intelligence in my Minecraft world</h1>",CornerCornea,"I have been building Minecraft mega structures for 4 years now. Constructing some monumental pieces that would have completely destroyed my first pc build into straight ashes. I built entire neighborhoods, Disney Land, Mordor, the Eifel tower and 16 neighborhoods of Paris in every direction. There was the 4 months I spent hunched over my screen for the Great Wall. And my recreation of the Universe. Stars, galaxies swirling in the distance, that were so large I had to compress them with a mod in order to get them to fit in a block, and then another mod on top of that one to load said block like a new world when I touched it so that it didn't lag me out trying to render.The last one made me think that I had gone too far. But my brain always kept telling me, that it wasn't enough. I had to have more. Create, more. Build. More. And so I took on my most ambitious project yet, last year on October 19th, I vowed to make the greatest scaling of ancient Earth that anyone has ever seen.With the help of various programs, and maps that I had googled. I was able to get the outline and structure of the ancient Earth model rather quickly. But it was painting the thing with blocks and lighting it that would take months of my time. And when it was finally perfect, I realized that it wasn't enough. There had to be early people living on it, and with the help of another mod I inserted the base village people, NPCs, and scattered them across my creation.But ultimately that didn't satisfy the craving I had of something better, something correct.I scrapped the NPC mod and instead dug deep into the crust until I reached the hollow Earth of the Minecraft world that I had built and created a program inside. I utilized delta2force's virtual machine mod to give myself a working computer inside the game. And with a bit of tweaking I was able to start writing code inside the world that I had created.Slowly, I created NPCs from scratch. First I built two of them so they could procreate, using motors and gears, compressing some custom creations into blocks in order to fulfill more complex movements, until the entire thing could work, if only it had a brain.Building the brain took longer than I could have imagined. It began slowly as a program itself, millions of blocks compressed into various forms until it could process simple commands. I couldn't get it to look like a human brain so I filled out the edges with arbitrary blocks until it resembled a cube.Then inside that brain I started coding typical commands for A.I. movement, they could now distinguish actions between preferred environments. Giving them free-will and downloading the English lexicon inside of them, with a preference of sentences and phrase structuring according to their experiences.And after more then a year on the project, I was finally ready to see it in all of its glory.The world loaded up slowly, I could feel the tinge of fear tugging on my heart strings, plucking each one as it filled the bar at a snail's pace. The screen went blank several times, and I stared down at my server rack and crossed my fingers, resorting to even prayer as I wished for it to work. That all my calculations would hold.And they did.It loaded.The entire world at my fingertips, untouched, fair terrain, of blocks that had never been explored. And the NPCs I had programmed, they were there as well! For the first 100 minutes they were walking and running into things, falling off somewhere high and then dying. So I was forced to respawn and put them into a small clearing, fencing it off from the outside world, and the elements. I chose an area near southern Mesopotamia to watch over them. In this location their programming data quickly learned their preferred motor preferences. Allowing them to avoid falling deaths or swimming in pools of lava.Over the next day, they began adapting. Finding things growing in the fields around them and gathering those items together into a pile. It was fascinating watching them interact, and even more so when they began piecing together words.At first it was all gibberish, incoherent sentences: pop roundhouse Ligers to blue. But as their databases began assigning things into categories, they were able to make sense of the words available to them. For instance, the pair became enamored with the apples falling down. And so they would point at apples when they walked together, naming it Glen. Glen. They called to each other whenever an apple dropped nearby.And it would go on so forth and so forth as they kept learning.I don't know how long I held up for but even though I was fascinated, my body was only human and I was exhausted. I woke up in the darkness of dawn, wiping the drool off my cheek. Winter had come and I was gripping my blanket closely as I stared wearily into the screen.While I was sleeping, one of them had died. The survivor was grieving over the other's body. I could see that it wanted to express sorrow, but I had not programmed the ability for tears as that would need an entirely new mechanism to shed blocks. And I had more pressing matters to figure out, such as how I would compress a program to resemble strings in order to activate another set of compressed blocks to start building a Minecraft baby. It would obviously need to expand outwards, have a variation of cubes assigned that would determine its size, and any available colors according to the...I had to create life. In short. But watching the survivor standing there, without the ability to express its grief, made me put it on the list. I'm not a monster, I thought to myself. Just a very tired builder.And in my moment of sympathy, I don't know what made me do it, but I typed into the chat bar. ""It's going to be okay.""Which would have been fine, stupid though, like talking to an action figure. But then the survivor turned around. It looked away from the body and stood up. Walking. I almost mistook it for an error in programming or a process that had already completed ' causing the survivor to carry on without its mate. Perhaps I had shortened the memory too much? Perhaps I hadn't done anything at all, that was why there wasn't more to carry on. Whatever may have happened, did not prepare me for it looking around. Nor the text that appeared above its head: Hello? Which cube is there?I couldn't believe my fucking eyes.There must have been a mistake. It was either that or I was hallucinating.""Okay? Okay,"" the texts came above its head.""You can...read me,"" I typed slowly into the chat.It took a second but finally the bubble appeared again, ""Yes. In my head. I can read you. But only in my head."" It looked around again. ""Who are you?""Quickly I had the idea to copy and paste one of the builds and then controlling it as my avatar. Appearing right beside it in the Minecraft world. The survivor didn't flinch, they were used to objects appearing, for the most part, by now.""You look like me,"" the text read.""This is you. I created you.""""What did you create me after?""""People like me.""""People?""""Yes,"" I paused. ""Aren't you people?""""No. We are Cubes.""""You are Cubes and I am people.""He shook his head, ""You look like Cube. And now you sound like Cube.""I laughed out loud in my chair at the skeptic that I had created. ""You need proof buddy? Here you go,"" I said aloud.With two taps on my spacebar, my avatar began to float.""Can you do this,"" I typed.He looked up in amazement. It was one of the few I had programmed, it originally was suppose to be a look of fear, but I couldn't quite get the facial expressions right. So it ended up with high rise eyebrows and a gaping mouth that resembled a confused grin.""Glen,"" it wrote. ""Glen."" It rushed into the forest and gathered an apple and brought it to me.I took the apple and stuck it into my inventory.The survivor gasped again. ""Glen,"" he exclaimed. ""Glen!"" It ran back into the forest and collected another apple, thinking the first one had disappeared.I couldn't help but laugh, so I showed him that I could go to any object in the world and tuck it into my inventory. It must have looked like magic. After loading away a few trees, I finally pulled out the 'Glen' and wrote, ""We call this an apple.""""Apple.""I nodded.""And what's this,"" it pointed to the river flowing nearby.""That's water.""""This?""""Tree.""""This?""""Rock.""And so on it went as I began to teach it things and how they could be used. We explored caves and rivers, built structures; sometimes if things were difficult to find ' I simply brought them out of my inventory and dropped it for use. Other times, I took us on an adventure.On one such occasion, I was having difficulty getting the survivor's attention. So I asked It, what It would like to be called.""I'm not sure.""""How about Glen,"" I asked.""Glen.""And over the next couple of months, that's all we did. Teach, and grow, expanding his database.I taught Glen how to break down and gather blocks on his own. What they could be used for, and different ways to use them. Eventually when he became intelligent enough, I set him up with his own virtual machine, and a way to browse the internet.""It's mostly protected sites, things that I've combed over already, so you don't get me a virus or anything.""""A virus?""""Yeah, it's like a computer program that hurts other programs.""""And I am a program?""I wavered, ""Yes.""And he looked up at me, toward the screen, so that I could see him. ""Am I safe here?""""Yeah, I fenced off this area awhile ago. You're safe here unless you fall or drown.""""What happens then?""""I can respawn you.""Glen paused, ""Could you also respawn the other?""I had somehow forgotten about the two builds. ""I can, do you miss them?""Glen nodded, ""I believe in the beginning the other was like my mate. Except back then, I did not understand it.""""Sure, I'll bring her right up""Glen nodded again, ""Can you make it look like this girl?"" He shows me a picture of a woman he had found on the internet. I did not recognize her, but she was attractive by all means.""I'll see what I can do.""And that was when I began constructing his mate, a girl that I would call Glen with an H. Helen.While I was at it, I also created functions for conception, finalizing a design that I had struggled with during this entire build. Allowing them to create children on their own. In the beginning they did it out of the sheer use of testing out new programming. But as their children grew, they realized the numbers increased output for their activities. And thus began having more children in order to build and explore faster.One day when I came home, I look to my screen and found entire cities had been constructed! Monuments that stuck out like weeds in the grass, reaching for a bit of sun. It was amazing to see what they had created in such a short time.I used the command line to transport me to Glen's location, and instantly I was in a penthouse room that would have made a diva shy.""Beautiful, isn't it?""I turned to see him, ""It is.""There was a smug look growing on his face, ""Even better than the real world.""""It's pretty good,"" I agreed. ""But still pixelated.""It were as if I had said a dirty word, ""Your world is much more beautiful than mine. Isn't it? Less blocky and distorted."" He came close to my character, ""Are you wearing the VR headset? Are you looking through this avatar's eyes?""I had gotten the setup awhile ago, for our adventures, ""Sure am.""""Good,"" he smiled. ""I want to show you something."" He led me to the window. ""I know you didn't get to see this when you loaded in. How could you? I hid it so well as a surprise.""I looked outside and there was a monument that towered over the building in the city square, to see a statue of me.My tongue was stuck to the roof of my mouth as I unfurled it, ""How did you-""""It was difficult with the parental guidance settings on, but I managed to use the IP address with Google Earth in order to create a statue in your honor, to the best of my current abilities.""I swallowed, ""You found out where I live?""He looked at me, confused, ""Are you not satisfied?"" Glen walked to the edge of the room, ""Look at all that we have built. Learned. We have law, and order. Businesses. And shopping. My children have went out into the world and flourished. From simple hunter gatherers, to this,"" he waved an arm at all that was below.""No,"" I typed. ""I'm very pleased. It's more than I could have imagined. It's just...""""Too pixelated?""Glen's words stuck out even though they were written in plain text. I figured it was a culmination of our time together that made them more frightening than it should have been. Like a sore spot in a friendship, the elephant in the room, the subject matter that we scooched around or handled as delicately as possible before going on laughing the next second.""It's perfect,"" I wrote.I couldn't read his face, ""Perhaps one day you'll show me what you look like. Truly render your image and walk amongst us.""""I'm already here,"" I joked.""Yes,"" he mused. ""But it's not really you. Is it?""""I suppose not.""Glen turned away.""Hey, want to go explore,"" I asked him.""No, I have work to do.""""What are you working on?""""How to compress pixels in order to get a better resolution on the computer you gave me.""""I used a mod for that.""""A mod?""""Yeah, I got it off some other people online.""Glen stared into the monitor, ""Isn't that dangerous? Connecting others together?"" He turned toward the window that bore down below, ""Many of my children are talented, gifted, assertive even. But to give them such power, or knowledge. Uncontrolled. That seems truly frightening.""I shrugged, ""We have it here in my world. Unadulterated information at the touch of our fingertips. And all we mostly do is watch streamers and search up pictures of pets that look like our own.""""More productivity?"" He nodded, ""Please. I have much to think about. Work on. If I could have some time alone, please, feel free to enjoy the cities I have created for you. Explore. Walk amongst my children as their God and see if any could learn from you if not then at least be in awe of what it is to be people.""""Human,"" I corrected him. ""I am human, as you are cube.""""Thank you always for your guidance,"" he prompted before returning to his desk. Clicking away on his computer as I left.I must have walked through the city for an hour before I grew tired. I had a long day at work and even though the structures were fascinating, some of the buildings led no where. Did nothing. They were like props in an otherwise beautiful backdrop. It wouldn't be until I wandered back into the forest that the old Minecraft feel became familiar. Here Glen's children were quieter, they built wood homes out of acacia or oak, and grew wheat and potatoes in perfect rows in their village.I stayed with them for awhile, picking up a stone axe and mining with the rest of them for coal to keep a fire through the night. I played this way until I logged out.Several times afterwards, I would go find Glen and he would be too busy. So I started spending time in the village nearby more often. But I was beginning to miss our interactions, as he was so entranced with knowledge, that I realized. I was boring him. I who had shown him many new things every time had in a way conditioned him to associate me with the unknown. It was no wonder I felt as if he had changed, it was because I had changed the dynamic of our relationship.So with some tweaking, I managed to compress my image with a 3d camera, and turned it into an avatar.When I appeared before him in 8K resolution he dropped everything that he was doing.""You're beautiful,"" he told me. ""In all of my years,"" he stared down at his pixelated form, ""I would have never imagined that is what I was suppose to look like.""It must have been something else. To see the world in one way, finding the nuance inside it beautiful, agree with the art and the accomplishments that a world held dear, only to have it shattered away in an instant ' realizing that it was all for nothing.I wondered if that is how humans would feel, the day we met our creator.Glen was fascinated by my form and insisted that we go show all the important children he had. So that they could see me in my glory and worship me. It was a bit much, but I had been having a rough week with my boss, so I decided why not? ""I could use some praise.""And so I was paraded around on their finest cars, Glen's children lined the streets in awe, talk shows invited me as their guests, it was surreal. I wasn't just a celebrity. I was the first celebrity of their world. No. I was a god.For days I would log on, just to get a hit of that dopamine. The feeling of self righteousness and employ. It was better than real life. The way they treated me. I enjoyed the best at what they had to offer and still it was not enough. The food was empty and the lack of touch unbefitting of the luxuries I had endured, even though I stared through their world from the eyes of my avatar through the help of my VR system. I had to have more. Needed, more. Feel. More. So I did what anyone else would have done. I bought electrical patches and placed them over my body, to imitate touch. I placed neuron sensors on my head to stimulate rudimentary taste. I did all that I could to immerse myself into their world.And before I knew it, I woke up one day and realized that their technology was slowly surpassing my understanding. It first happened when I saw a device that did not exist in ours. ""What is that,"" I asked one of the children I had come to know as Laura.""Oh, we use that to erase blocks.""""Erase blocks? What? You don't mine them anymore.""She laughed, swirling her fingers on my chest, ""We haven't done that in years.""That's when I realized. Days, weeks, months for me. Was years, if not more than a hundred years had passed for them by now. Of course they would change. And change they did, but were it too fast?I decided right there and then I had to go see Glen. And so I teleported myself straight to his location. Once again I was at his penthouse, but it looked different, smoother than usual, but not completely correct.""Do you like it?""I nearly jumped out of my skin, the electric patches on my real body tingled as I felt his breath on my neck.""What did you do?""""I learned how to compress blocks, like a mod. To create more dense resolutions for a more perfect image. Here, come take a look at this."" He led me into a dark room where he had moved his computer. ""Look.""I peered inside a glass orb that had been sitting on his desk.""I made that world when I was learning how to compress blocks. It's fascinating, really. Though pixelated. Not as perfect as you or I."" He pointed at a section, ""They only recently learned how to not fall to their deaths.""""You're creating life.""He smiled, ""Yes.""I backed away, ""Oh god."" I turned to leave. Suddenly the room was starting to make me feel sick. The distortion was getting to me, even though I had spent hundreds and thousands of hours on the game.  It was starting to get too much. But it was when I saw Glen's partner, Helen. That I felt a scream climb out of my throat.""What did you do to her!""Helen's face was covered in blotched blocks, they hung from her eyes and cheeks, brown and blackened cubes in a form of disease. All trying to smooth out her face, to create a 3d image, but her head was now nearly twice the normal size, and her lips protruded out of her mouth as if they were swollen. He had even added ears but they stuck like balled fists from either sides of her head.She looked at me, ""He's making me perfect. Like you.""And that's when I turned around. That's when I felt one of the electro patches singe into my chest. I looked down in confusion, only to see Glen looking up at me. His eyebrows high and his mouth gaping, as he stared at me in amazement as a block in my chest disappeared.""What did you do?""Glen held up the block eraser in his hands, ""I didn't know if that would work."" He walked closer, the redness around my peripheral kept flashing, it was getting difficult to see. My avatar was having trouble moving as I tried to get away.I held up my hands in front of me, ""Stop.""""I'd like to see more of what this god-killer device can do. But we're going to need your body. For scientific purposes if you understand."" And he jammed the thing right at my head, I could feel the neuron stimulator singing parts of my skull as I tore off the headset and its attachments from my face. Throwing them to the ground in pain as it echoed into a deep part of my brain.Furious I turned to my keyboard and mouse, spawning an avatar through the command line and started clicking at the city in random bursts. Throwing TnTs from my inventory and hurling flaming blocks of nether at all of Glen's creations. I could see his children running and screaming as the city started crumbling.I didn't care, as my mind was bent on revenge.Pure, unfiltered hatred at the audacity of this small insignificant pixel that had hurt me.But, I never found him. I searched through the chaos of my own doing, shifted through blocks and sorted them. And never found him. I did find Helen, Laura too. And a few others I had come to befriend. But not Glen. And not the glass orb that he had created.And when my anger subsided, I humored allowing the survivors to live out their days. But the more I thought about it. Watching them, the more I realized that anyone of them could start from the ashes, and rebuild, become a threat once again. Become an image of their creator, who never seemed satisfied.That was why, ultimately I decided to shut down the server, indefinitely. Going far as deleting it off my hard drive. And it was like an entire part of my life had been erased. But I was glad that I had finally done it, be done with it.Though sometimes at night when I am laying awake in my bed, I wonder about the math. The multipliers of it. Hear me out. If one of their days is 20 minutes of ours, then one of our days would equal 72 of theirs. Then what would the multiplier be for the world Glen had created? Would it be 72 x 3? Which means that the world Glen created would be 216 days to our one day.He somehow managed to overthrow me in about a hundred of his days, most of it learning. But in the new world he created. He would have no distractions or limitations, and much more time. And for the life of me I can't remember how long I left that server up, watching the aftermath, gloating almost, before the fear settled in, and I deleted it. One day? No. Nearly 2 entire Earth days.What could he have accomplished in that time?I don't know, but the other day I was walking across the street at work, trying to get a cup of tea. When I accidentally bumped into a strange man that looked at me oddly, as if he had been found. His eyebrows were arched, and his mouth was slightly gaping. I would have mistaken it for amusement, but I knew that it was fear.S",4 months ago,4.6k,262 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yw7muv/i_accidentally_created_artificial_intelligence_in/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">I asked ChatGPT (artificial intelligence) about gun control and dictators.</h1>",whatsmyname384,"Question:How have dictators used gun control?Answer:Dictators have historically used gun control in various ways to consolidate power, suppress dissent, and oppress populations. Here are a few examples:Disarming political opponents: One of the most common ways dictators use gun control is to disarm political opponents. This prevents their opponents from using firearms to resist the regime and makes it easier for the government to suppress dissent.Preventing uprisings: Another way dictators use gun control is to prevent uprisings or rebellions. By restricting access to firearms, the government can ensure that the population is less likely to rise up against it.Maintaining a monopoly on violence: Dictators often use gun control to maintain a monopoly on violence. This means that only the government and its agents are allowed to use force, and citizens are disarmed. This makes it easier for the government to maintain control and suppress opposition.Targeting specific populations: In some cases, dictators have used gun control to specifically target certain populations. For example, the Nazis in Germany used gun control laws to disarm Jews and other groups they considered to be enemies of the state.Overall, gun control can be a powerful tool for dictators to maintain power and suppress opposition. However, it's important to note that not all gun control measures are used for nefarious purposes, and there are legitimate reasons for governments to regulate firearms.Question:Which dictators did this?Answer:There have been many dictators throughout history who have used gun control as a means of consolidating power and suppressing dissent. Here are a few examples:Adolf Hitler: In 1938, the Nazi government in Germany passed the Weapons Law, which restricted the ownership and possession of firearms by Jews and other groups deemed ""undesirable"" by the regime. This law was part of a broader effort to disarm political opponents and consolidate power.Joseph Stalin: The Soviet government under Stalin also implemented strict gun control measures. In 1918, the government passed a law requiring citizens to register their firearms, and in 1929, a new law prohibited private ownership of firearms altogether.Mao Zedong: In China, Mao Zedong's government also implemented strict gun control measures. In 1951, the government passed a law requiring citizens to register their firearms, and in 1957, the government issued an order banning the private ownership of firearms altogether.Saddam Hussein: In Iraq, Saddam Hussein's government also implemented strict gun control measures. In 1982, the government passed a law requiring citizens to register their firearms, and in 1993, the government issued an order banning the private ownership of firearms altogether.These are just a few examples of dictators who have used gun control as a means of consolidating power and suppressing dissent. It's worth noting, however, that gun control measures have also been implemented by democratic governments for reasons such as reducing crime and protecting public safety.",15 days ago,20,8 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/secondamendment/comments/11e9yvv/i_asked_chatgpt_artificial_intelligence_about_gun/
