23,              Daniel Crespin            ,"Excelente video cuya calidad atribuyo a dos factores. Por una parte al conocimiento a fondo de la IA evidenciado en especial cuando hablan de redes neuronales. Y por la otra a un dominio completo de las matemáticas. 

La maestría matemática queda ampliamente demostrada en el correcto tratamiento que hace vuestro canal de infinidad de cuestiones de álgebra, análisis y geometría, topología incluida.

Respecto a las redes neuronales cabe señalar que existe una manera alterna, poco divulgada, de obtener redes profundas de perceptrones, es decir redes con tres o más capas de perceptrones, similares a las que se calculan ajustando pesos mediante retropropagación de errores. 

Dicho método alternativo calcula la red profunda directamente a partir de los datos (ejemplos y contraejemplos) y de las franjas de separación deseadas en las hipersuperficies decisorias. Esta metodología inédita no utiliza para nada la retropropagación.

Se trata de un algoritmo, ya codificado en un programa y evaluado numéricamente, que se basa en formular los perceptrones en términos de categorías (objetos y morfismos) y en analizarlos en términos geométricos, todo lo cual permite un tratamiento transparente de la data numérica. 

El desempeño del algoritmo es notablemente más predecible, exacto y rápido que la retropropagación. Para una introducción a su uso sugiero que den un vistazo al siguiente video 
https://youtu.be/VTDIedU3F-E
en cuya descripción hallaréis un enlace para descargar el software (además de links a referencias), que corre en plataforma Windows, es totalmente gratuito y ni siquiera requiere instalación (es autoportante). Podréis probar el software con vuestros propios archivos de datos numéricos y comprobar a cabalidad que las redes así obtenidas reconocen exitosamente la data.

Felicitaciones por tan clara introducción a la IA y en particular a las redes neuronales.

En primer lugar felicitarle por el canal. De pequeño me encantaban las matemáticas. Me quisieron ascender dos cursos pero di con una mala experiencia debido a eso y bullying y terminé dejando todo... Ojalá le hubiera conocido de pequeño....

Quisiera pedirle en segundo lugar un video a fondo sobre la proporción Áurea. Me gustaría poder compartir la importancia de la proporción Áurea con todos los que siguen este canal ya que es muy importante... Esta presente en todo lo que nos rodea... De hecho, incluso se asocia a la belleza ya que las personas que más se acercan en esas proporciones, más bellas las percibimos. 

Es realmente increíble, tanto en estructuras naturales como puede ser los tallos y ramificaciones de las plantas como en todo. Se que de haber continuado unos estudios fuertes, me habría gustado poder comprobar como la inteligencia está fuertemente relacionada con dicha proporción etc... Es tema largo para poder desarrollarme por aquí. Pero no solo está presente en nosotros y en la tierra, sino en el universo. 

En mi teoría, las ramificaciones cerebrales, como las propias ideas y la consciencia están completamente relacionadas con dicha proporción. Es demasiado profundo para un post, pero me encantaría poder comenzar viendo un vídeo por su parte y poder comentar allí. Gracias!

Ya hay inteligencias artificiales especializadas en arte, filosofía, creatividad... Podrán sustituir a los humanos en todo perfectamente y en poco tiempo. Podrán ""emular"" amor, compasión y bondad... Serán incluso muy buenos compañeros.

Una renta básica universal compatible con una actividad económica a costa incluso de adelgazar en un 90% lo ""público"" (políticos, asesores, funcionarios, ONU, ONGs y fundaciones...); Con una superdemocracia con voto y antivoto en TODO cada semana... Sería ideal!

La gente se dedicaría al arte y belleza, cultura, filosofía, bondad, deporte y salud, ocio, ecologismo y pacifismo...

El desempleo tecnológico es una posibilidad ""encerrada bajo llave"" desde el 2008.

La ciencia y tecnología si no se le ponen trabas por intereses económicos de unos pocos es exponencial (muy rápida y cada vez más rápida) y implica a TODO a la vez (un descubrimiento matemático por ejemplo, incide en informática, energía, medicina....).

@) biotecnología, ingeniería genética y puede que eugenesia, control demográfico y transhumanismo.

@) impresoras en 3d con nanomateriales y posibilidad de inexistencia de ""obsolencia programada"".

5 También se le dio boca que hablaba grandes cosas y blasfemias; y se le dio autoridad para actuar cuarenta y dos meses.
6 Y abrió su boca en blasfemias contra Dios, para blasfemar de su nombre, de su tabernáculo, y de los que moran en el cielo.
7 Y se le permitió hacer guerra contra los santos, y vencerlos. También se le dio autoridad sobre toda tribu, pueblo, lengua y nación.
8 Y la adoraron todos los moradores de la tierra cuyos nombres no estaban escritos en el libro de la vida del Cordero que fue inmolado desde el principio del mundo.
9 Si alguno tiene oído, oiga.
10 Si alguno lleva en cautividad, va en cautividad; si alguno mata a espada, a espada debe ser muerto. Aquí está la paciencia y la fe de los santos.
11 Después vi otra bestia que subía de la tierra; y tenía dos cuernos semejantes a los de un cordero, pero hablaba como dragón.
12 Y ejerce toda la autoridad de la primera bestia en presencia de ella, y hace que la tierra y los moradores de ella adoren a la primera bestia, cuya herida mortal fue sanada.
13 También hace grandes señales, de tal manera que aun hace descender fuego del cielo a la tierra delante de los hombres.
14 Y engaña a los moradores de la tierra con las señales que se le ha permitido hacer en presencia de la bestia, mandando a los moradores de la tierra que le hagan imagen a la bestia que tiene la herida de espada, y vivió.
15 Y se le permitió infundir aliento a la imagen de la bestia, para que la imagen hablase e hiciese matar a todo el que no la adorase.
16 Y hacía que a todos, pequeños y grandes, ricos y pobres, libres y esclavos, se les pusiese una marca en la mano derecha, o en la frente;
17 y que ninguno pudiese comprar ni vender, sino el que tuviese la marca o el nombre de la bestia, o el número de su nombre.

Que significa la palabra ARTIFICIAL?! Sin contestar todo esto antes es solo repetir como una INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL todo lo que OTROS AI han escrito o dicho!
La INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL ya esta apoderandoce del planeta, el problema es que como en la pelicula ""Blade Runner"", es muy dificil saber si la entidad que uno tiene enfrente es ""inteligencia artificial""o un VERDADERO SER HUMANO, de los cuales hay muy muy pocos en la Tierra! Pero los HUMANOS estan regresando y van a ELIMINAR A TODOS LOS ROBOTS CON INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL! PORQUE ES IMPOSIBLE QUE LA CREACION DERROTE O SOBREPASE A SU CREADOR! ESE ES SOLO EL SUEÑO DE UN MONTON DE ROBOTS CON INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL  A LOS CUALES QUE LES GUSTARIA SER MAS QUE SU CREADOR, PERO NO SE PUEDE!!! HELLO!!!! Si YO creo un robot con inteligencia artificial, me voy a dormir con miedo de que la maquina se despierte en medio de la noche y me acuchille mientras duermo?? NO! Solo los ROBOTS CON INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL tienen miedo de otros robots, los HUMANOS no tienen miedo de lo que ELLOS HAN CREADO, hora de despertar cabrones!!! Quere saber como se ve un robot con inteligencia artificial?? bueno mire a todas las criaturas que se creen MERCADERES, POLITICOS, GURUS, PROFESORES, ESTRELLAS FAMOSAS, DEPORTISTAS DE ELITE, ETC! TODOS ESO NO SON HUMANOS, REPITO, NO SON HUMANOS!, SON ROBOTS CON INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL, ES DECIR, UNA INTELIGENCIA PUESTA EN ELLOS POR LOS HUMANOS! Y QUE NO SE DA DE FORMA NATURAL, sin conciencia de algo mas grande que ellos mismos, POR LO TANTO ARTIFICIAL!! COMO SE PROGRAMA A UN ROBOT CON INTELIGENCIA ARTIOFICIAL?

This Robot desires to be a human, but is missing something, not only the lack of urge to send pics to people online, but acceptance, he states “I can’t feel all the ways it feel to become human,” and this is why he is not human.

Near the end of the song, he accepts that he is not feeling all the feelings and this makes him human, at least up until the rage comes back. He wishes to rid the world of these vile humans he used to wish to become, out of jealousy, and starts to lose his acceptance of himself as human. He then returns to his Artificial state.

I'm a trans girl who started estrogen 2 months ago. One of the things they don't tell you often is how it affects not only your body, but also your mental and emotional state.

445,              Ferdziosz            ,"There is so much thought put into this song

At first, the protagonist sounds very robotic, despite feeling almost every human emotion, indicating he is yet to reach desired level of being human. He felt them all but one - the need to send a photo of his genitals to some strangers. But does he really need to?

In the second chapter of the song, our hero is getting closer to reaching his goal. He experiences stronger feelings, like seeing his robot crush making out with robot douchebag. He goes home and sings how sad and alone he feels. This is the moment of transformation. He realizes, that the essence of humanity isn't just a set of rules, it is the ability to feel wide spectrum of emotions, simple and more complex ones, but also to be human is to be self-aware of how and why one feels a certain way (note how he says he is glad to be sad, because that means he does indeed feel real emotions). His voice also changes to sound more human-like - just like Pinocchio, he turns into a real boy. 

The third chapter tells another story - he is not a robot anymore, he is human (despite not feeling the need to send a dick pic). But there is one more thing he is not anymore - he is not pure of heart. His desire to become human turned him into a wannabe slaver. He claims to be superior to the human race because of said pictures (or lack of them). This is where we come full circle - the voice is again very robotic, indicating his descent into previous state, by which I mean being not-human. Is it because of his violent tendencies - can we call a human someone with such evil plans like enslaving the whole planet? Or does he turn into a robot by choice, after comprehending what he thinks it does mean to be human? Note how the song comes full circle, ending with the same verse it starts, almost identically, but being cut when we least anticipate it. Why does it end that way? Did the robot end himself? Or, since he considers himself a human now, or even something more, the song ends because he is no longer the subject of it? It leaves a nice space for interpretation, catalizing discussions and thoughts like this one.",3.6K,24,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTl8ZYImjBQ

And musically it is amazing. The man can write the shit out of a song!

i shared this with my mom, whose expression of hopelessness every time i tell her i want her to watch something and she realizes it's tom cardy again makes me feel guilty but not guilty enough, and when the first ""i've never felt the need to send a photo of my penis to a stranger on the internet..."" came on she just slowly and silently laid her hand over her cheek and i think about that every time i watch it now. yeah! it's the perfect song! and i love it so much",3,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTl8ZYImjBQ

1128,              Claudia G.            ,"I have a theory about a possible connection with 4055.
First, it struck me that ""Robot Michelle"" and ""Robot Charlie"" are odd names. Is the inclusion of ""Robot"" a neutral identifier or shows a social division between robots and humans?
We have few direct information on the status of Robots in the society of ""Artificial Intelligence"".
Robots are shown to have (almost) the full range of human emotions, have social interactions with humans (for it to be neccesary to avoid offending a possibly pregnant person) and have social media accounts, with which our protagonists tries to befriend humans at 1:55 (which also reveals that a robot can have respect and admiration for a human, and acquire their number), and also receives an unsolicited dickpic at 3:01.
On the other hand, robots have their own ""robot parties"", and most crucially, like shown at 1:55, are shunned and insulted by humans. ""Robot fuck"" and ""Robot cunt"" again is clearly othering language, which is persistent.
Overall robots seem to be very similar to humans and partake in society, yet also form a sub-society and are treated as other and inferior. In this light, our protagonist's desire to become human and obsession which becomes destructive also makes sense as internalized bigotry against robots (which could have also contributed to his isolation, melancholy and desperation)

Another detail about the shot at 1:55  is that the humans in question are named ""mark and charlie"". The choice to have the name Charlie appear twice (Robot Charlie) is also odd, though in isolation I didn't dare to openly speculate about it.
That changed when I watched 4055 and I had a possible lead for my intuitive hunch. In 4055, the first main character has a robot that looks exactly like him and which he forces to do chores and endure his abuse. A robot that looks exactly like him and belongs to him, could he also share his name?
Is Robot Charlie the robot doppelgänger of Charlie? ""Robot Charlie"" does sound more like ""robot version of Charlie"" then ""a robot named Charlie"".
Also 4055 features a robot revolt where a robot overlord (singular) enslaves the whole of humanity and quit his servitude after having shit thrown at his face (you could say, humanity's fucked up shit changed his mind). Could Artificial Intelligence show the full development of this robot overlord?
There's also nothing in Artificial Intelligence which would contradict all of humanity and robotkind living on a spacecraft, humans being cyborgs and other details from 4055.

Admittedly it's more complicated to link the two worlds. 4055 gives the impression of more extreme robot oppression. However, this impression isn't solidified with more details and one can fill the gaps of 4055 with the more nuanced worldbuilding of Artificial Intelligence without contradiction. 4055's first main character treats his robot very degradingly, but is chiefly motivated by boredom. Also considering how robots in 4055 look exactly like humans and have the emotional complexity to feel humiliation, it seems unlikely robots were created to just be mindless servants. So it's possible to imagine that robots in 4055 have a role in society more like in Artifical Intelligence. The first main character of 4055 could also show his human bias by being ignorant of robots' rich inner and social lives (which mirrors his apathy towards the sub-human farms)
Likewise, the protagonist of Artificial Intelligence turned pretty easily from being polite and trying to impress humans to wanting to enslave all of them, hinting that in the background there could be more serious human abuses against robots which he finally came to see for what it is.
Alternatively, it's also possible that there was more than one robot revolution (if the previous ones failed) and human-robot relations deteriorated strongly, leading to the conditions of 4055.",1,3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTl8ZYImjBQ

The way the video was shot and edited was visually appealing and added to the overall message being conveyed. The use of metaphors and symbolism was effective in highlighting the various themes explored in the video.
 
The concept of ""carrying things"" as a metaphor for the burdens we carry in our lives was a compelling one. The video did an excellent job of portraying how these burdens can be physical, emotional, and mental and can manifest in different ways. It was also interesting to see how the protagonist dealt with these burdens and overcame them, ultimately finding peace and happiness.

By some supernatural intervention or mere coincidental ponderance, ""man"" experienced a hesitancy and unassuredness to the exact proportion as the state of the future world would require. A world where such a notion as relegating strenuous tasks to artificial intelligence to free up time for one's personal satisfaction and expression through art and beauty may appear idyllic and inevitable, yet remains ever out of reach. Just as a sailor pressing onward to touch the horizon will never reap the reward of his plight, even so the utopia provided by the application of artificial intelligence to humanity's inauspicious labor will forever be out of reach. Confirmation of this notion is received via the second half of the sketch. Lacking any basis upon which to found his facial contortion, deep down ""man sans jacket, sans glasses"" knew the truth. In his most self-sacrificial and generous act, ""man"" compromised his humanity for the good of all observers, present and future, that they too may understand the gravity of such frivolous claims. In a mere one second clip, ""man"" opens himself up and what do we find?

Really quickly, the statement ‘AI will take over’ stopped becoming a kind of funny, pessimistic view of the future… and it just became the very near future.

1748,,"Hi everyone, exactly a week ago, we conducted a quiz contest in this video. The answer to the quiz is given below:
Option D: AI that develops emotions over time
Explanation: An AI which develops emotions does not exist as of now. Such an AI would be classified as Strong AI and we haven't yet cracked the code for it. Option D is the correct answer.

- Saudi Arabi has granted citizenship to an AI named Sophia.
- Kengoro is an AI robot built by some Japanese researchers that has an intricate muscular system.
- IBM Watson has the capability to recognize emotions based on speech and their undertone. 
Hence, options A, B and C are wrong.

We are pleased to announce the 3 lucky winners who got the right answer for our quiz:
1. Eragon Ritter
2. Sree Arpita
3. Jorge Bassig

This would allow us to sidestep many of the problems of AI, because then it won't actually do anything. It'll just help us figure out a variety of solutions. Perhaps after we've sufficiently advanced that sort of AI and gotten a hang of it, we could start dipping our toes into a more robust AI system.

 (Another one of the problems would be that the greater an AI's agency, especially if it should develop some form of emotions, the more important it'll be to give it ethics. And humans are pretty bad at ethics when we look at our track record.)",9,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

It's easy for humans to forget that though so they'll keep making the same mistakes and struggle with with the fact a lot of things can mean multiple things lol so you ask it ""Give me a video that plays Latin music"" but it will just give you something it thinks you wanted but probably won't be because there's different types of Latin music... fast, slow, spanish guitar, salsa, cuba, and uses other different types of instruments at the forefront sooo you need to specify exactly what you want it to find.

I'm also already finding with the AI put into Bing i need to either use keywords or maybe add a couple more words in there to see what results it gets from the adjusted searches, the keywords one seemed to put all the searches into it but it puts some of the best ones from the last search onto the other pages rather than the first one, but it still gave me a few other useful links the last search didn't seeCurrently on google the results aren't as specific and doesn't stay specific as you go through each page.

I don't feel you can improve it a whole lot because of how it doesn't understand the objective and it's growth is limited because of how you need to keep specifying and it will struggle with something even a bit more complex and it can't think realistically about each and every situation we morph through every single day, the speed at which it does it and the accuracy i think can be improved but it's limited because it's just an algorithm.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

However the notion that humans will stop learning (being curious) or teaching each other if machines do most everything for us comes from the mind of someone with no curiosity, no love and has never hung with children or those who are childlike. Machines do a lot for us now, yet have children stopped asking questions or being curious, have people stopped loving, supporting and needing each other, no … never. Granted many now have their noses stuck in their phones but still the best thing for a person is another person.

(how many people does not want to mentally calculate  - even small operations -  by him/herself knowing that your phone, computers, etc can do it without difficulties.)
However, a tool, remain a tool. Calculating something without knowing the purpose of the operation make you not even want to calculate it at all. My point is, I think we will use AI in ALL DOMAINS to help to do tedious work. Even in domain that needs a huge experience (such as recognizing diseases and proposing cures) And maybe even innovated ones. However, at the end, you still need humans to ask for the needs and to adjust the solution proposed.

So we shld not see it as a competition, but an evolution.

The same way, in the 19th century most of our people had a work related to farm/food production, the automatisation and replacement of labor by machine made most humans moving from this sector to other ones. And that's good.
I doubt that people will be ok to return to harvest manually the wheat in fields. We prefer to avoid as much as possible tedious tasks if we can, and we kind of prefer to work in creative or none-monotonous tasks.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

AI is definitely shaping the world as we speak but GPAI is all together a different beast that no one even come close to achieving it. Yes we have some large data trained GPT systems but they're just a good systems to put one word after another by looking at previous examples. It has no notion of what it is achieving.

which is generating Arts from scratch, and writing Code.

everything else is a child play, because AI already solves the hardest problem and everything
other than that is super Easy.
there will be no exception, All jobs will be disrupted

in the future, there will be hundreds of different AI specialized in one specific problem,
so that if the AI makes an error, there will be other AI work on fact checking and fixing the issue, 
then there will be an AI Auditing the overall product produced by the other AI.

all of the combination above will guarantee AI to be able to do all Human Jobs
with amazing precision and they can produce Millions of things in Millisecond.

AI will rewrite history, our language,
and we won't be able to understand them anymore.
they will rewrite their own program Thousands time a second, and we won't be able to decipher anything at all.

2831,              Zack Barkley            ,"I think ultimately the objective function needs to be defined mathematically...to promote a more extensive local low entropy state (life and order) while maximally externalizing the necessary disorder that must be produced to maintain that order.  This is a quandary because life cannot exist without producing disorder, and it has been postulated its whole reason to exist is to increase disorder in the universe at large by overcoming natural energy barriers for which inanimate matter has a very low probability to utilize or cross.   Plants do this by creating more disorder by turning the sun's visible light photons into more disorganized infrared photons via photosynthesis, but the key here is  that this disorder get radiated into space...nonlocal disorder.  Herbivores parasitize plants and create more local but manageable disorder in plants, and carnivores do this in kind to herbivores.  Humans and even more so AI will exponentially increase the ability for entropy production but the real danger is that this disorder is more local on earth and can extinguish all life then.  It will be a delicate balance and perhaps even against our nature  because humans by nature want to exploit and create more local disorder in a living world to give themselves more order and more disorder producing abilities.  Ai is already being used to do this via corporations that now exploit the masses to produce more order within an elite few by robbing much of humanity of wealth and resources through lightning fast automatic stock trading, lean management and austerity algorithms, propaganda algorithms, and advanced surveillance and  weapons technologies.  It could and will get out of hand quickly if we don't promote a more equitable world and prime AI to promote local order by externalizing the increased disorder over the long term...as do plants.  Unfortunately...this goes against our nature as hervbivores and carnivores at the top of the food chain who naturally are inclined to tolerate and exploit more locally produced entropy.

AI may be the pinnacle of human civilization, because it could potentially enhance this machine we call civilization into something so uncontrollable that people wouldn't be able to adapt to it. Our priorities have become ""efficiency"" and ""technological advancement"", instead of nurturing humanity and building a world that is equitable, peaceful, and easy. Not to say that it is impossible nor possible to foster a global utopia, it's just that I think that we need heavy regulation on AI and tech, and to convince people that, just because we can make AI, doesn't mean that we should.

Regulations might be:
- Outlawing automated raw material extraction (disables self-replicative abilities for AI)
-Outlawing automated law enforcement 
-Outlawing automated military capabilities
-Outlawing automated judicial systems
-Outlawing AI in surveillance
-Installing automatic kill switches in all AI that are both digital and physical (phones and key-switches respectively)

Fundamentally, we need to create legal infrastructure that disables any capability for AI to self-replicate or involve itself in affairs pertaining directly to individual safety. Our only fighting chance at escaping a system that aims to enhance itself (SAI) is the fact that it may not possess the sufficient, raw resources to enhance itself. This cannot be the only barrier to regulating AI down to being a convenience tool.

For example, someone might suggest booking a southern route for winter travel - just in case there might be a snow storm. Some people call this ""playing chess"" because they are thinking a move ahead. And thinking a move ahead is exactly what computers are best at! Computers are so good at it, they have been OPTIMIZING complex problems for decades. Think of chess games and GPS navigation systems. Even 30 years ago, no one ever asked a chess computer to ""forget the consequences, just make any legal move"" or GPS system ""take us anywhere, its OK if you drive on the sidewalk."" Quite the contrary. Computers have been optimizing every step. And again, they have been doing this for decades. Why do people think computers will suddenly stop optimizing (ie ""playing chess"") as they get smarter. If anything, I see AI expanding the optimizing process rather than eliminating it.

This can be done by implementing policies that encourage the use of clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.

ChatGPT: To brew coffee in an ethical way, you can start by buying coffee beans that are fair trade and sustainably sourced. This means that the coffee beans were grown and harvested in a way that is environmentally responsible and supports the workers who produced them.
 
Next, you can use a coffee brewing method that is gentle on the environment, such as a French press or a pour-over cone. Avoid using disposable coffee pods, as they create a significant amount of waste.
 
When brewing your coffee, be sure to use fresh, cold water and the proper ratio of coffee to water. This will ensure that you extract the full flavor and aroma of the coffee beans.
 
Finally, consider composting your used coffee grounds, which can add valuable nutrients to your garden or compost bin. By following these steps, you can enjoy a delicious cup of coffee while also supporting ethical and sustainable practices.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

Right now if you teach an AI the 7-8 petabytes of knowledge needed to behave in the same way a human does, it's going to take way too much time and computational power for the AI to be useful. We also don't know how the AI is going to behave with that knowledge. There's no guarantee that it will be human-like. It probably won't. I get the metric of 7-8 petabytes from what neurosurgeons and computer scientists believe is the storage capacity for the human brain.

Add quantum computing into the mix though and things could potentially become way more efficient. A bit of data can be either a one, a zero or both. The speed of learning (writing), acting on (reading) and retrieving data could become exponentially faster. Task management and the additional considerations like coffee price mentioned in the video could be much more efficiently deduced. The possibilities with these two technologies coming together are endless. My suspicion is that we will reach this achievement but shrinking the hardware down to that of a human body equivalent is hundreds of years off. What might occur in the nearer future is space stations, air-craft, the biggest naval ships, space ships and large buildings will be able to draw power from nuclear reactors (fission in the next 100 years & fusion in the next 200 years) to provide the necessary power and cooling resources to make the AI function in a usable capacity.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

Large transformer models have a lot more common sense than most people seem to understand. They do have real, serious limitations, including that they are extremely vulnerable to leading questions, they tend to hallucinate (make up ""facts"" that are not true), and they are not yet continuous learners. They are pre-trained, and only have short-term session memory, rather than long term learning memory. This is not because we don't know how to create continuous learners, but really for two reasons: 1. We want AI to progress in a slow-ish controlled manner. 2.

AI: 
TED Talks are a series of conferences and events organized by the nonprofit organization TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design). The conferences feature short, TED-branded talks on a wide range of topics, including science, technology, engineering, art, design, business, and many others. The talks are typically given by experts in their fields and are intended to inspire, educate, and inform audiences around the world. Many TED Talks are available online and can be watched for free on the TED website or on YouTube.
 
TED Talks have become popular because they offer a unique format that allows speakers to share their ideas and knowledge in an engaging and accessible way. Each talk is typically 18 minutes or less, which makes them easy to watch and digest. Additionally, the topics covered in TED Talks are diverse and often thought-provoking, which makes them interesting and relevant to a wide audience.
 
In addition to the conferences, TED also offers a number of other resources, such as TED-Ed, which produces educational videos, and TEDx, which are independently organized TED events. Overall, TED is committed to spreading ideas and knowledge through its conferences, talks, and other resources, with the goal of inspiring and enriching the lives of its audience.

Therefore, while it is true that things may get a bit ""weird"" as AI becomes more prevalent, the potential rewards far outweigh the risks. - Written by OpenAI.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

But wait, wasn't it humans who coded every line of what the AI can and cannot get up to in the first place?  Is the AI this video talks about an AI that programmed itself?  No such thing exists because, surprise, humans haven't figured it out yet.  Why is this person talking in the video assuming the AI of the near future will, by default, know - how - to, say, extract a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere?  It has to be told how to do this from a base programming layer.  I hate how afraid we're supposed to be of AI like it's the boogeyman.

AI will be as transformative and disruptive as the last 30 years of the internet. So make sure you prepare yourself strategically for the new world that is rapidly approaching. People are not taking AI seriously enough. They are treating AI as a toy but AI will disrupt every industry. Humans must start preparing now for living and working alongside AI in a hybrid, human-AI world. If you are not adapting your workflow to leverage AI, you will be out of a job soon. The future is hybrid.
The next trillion dollar company will be in AI. One of the reasons that I invested in Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple recently — even though these companies already seem to have maxed out their growth potential — is because I believe that they will be the leaders in AI. Only these companies have the funding and infrastructure necessary to make AI work at a global scale. So either Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Apple will buy up all the best AI start-ups, or if they are foolish enough not to buy them up, one of those startups will reach a trillion dollar market cap in the next 10 years. That's my prediction. I also see that Tesla, Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and similar companies might do good really well from AI. The trillion dollar question is: Who will corner the AI market first? This market will be bigger than the entire mobile market. It's just unclear right now who will dominate it.

 if it's a super A.I. then It might think that humans are not worthy to be serve or help by them if humans just think them as tool not as a family,friend or treat them with the same amount of respect a human gets when he or she does the same job.

A.I. are not completely bad! They are just the victim of few humans with maliciousness and abuses towards machines.
But unfortunately they don't know the proper way how to protest or protect themselves from their own unfortunate masters abuse, who treated them as throwaway tools.

Which brought us the very important question, how the artificial intelligence will get it's own justice or salvation from their human master abuse and maliciousness...

￼￼

Is it true that if I ask AI to get me a cup of coffee that AI might kill someone to complete my order?

No, it is not true that if you ask AI to get you a cup of coffee, AI might kill someone to complete your order. AI is a machine that operates based on the instructions and algorithms provided by humans. AI does not have the capacity for self-motivation or intention to harm humans. AI is designed to follow specific rules and protocols, and it can only perform tasks that it has been programmed to do.
Furthermore, ethical considerations and safety protocols are integrated into the development and implementation of AI technologies. AI systems are designed with safety measures and fail-safes to prevent harm to humans. AI developers and manufacturers are also subject to regulatory oversight and standards to ensure that AI is safe and reliable for use.
In short, AI is not capable of killing someone to complete your order, and the development and implementation of AI technologies prioritize safety and ethical considerations. -Chat GPT",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

The happiest day of all, where he didn't even need to be organic to be loved by his mommy.

The ""parenting instinct"" and why people choose to become parents.  Or more and more, why they don't.  Especially if the time isn't just right.",3,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_19pRsZRiz4

Now at the age of 29,it still gets to me emotional. Call me a pussy cry baby all yall want,but hey,at least Im human to feel something. I got a soul,something David wanted...

David changed my perspective in a sense of life's point of view. Yes,as humans we HAVE THE CHOICE to hate or love,robots don't. Yet 13 years later,look at what we have become,closely to being robots. Cell phones made us diconnect to people in some extent. All this gadgets are creating a world similar to David's world,empty in the inside....

A.I has so much meaning,maybe I didn't understand it back then,but now I understand David perfectly.

I am 21 now and just watched it again, and honestly, even though it is not as deep as I have it in memory, it still scares the shit outta me. Multiple scenes actually do. The ending was extremely stupid in my opinion, but the overall fear that nothing really matters, that time will just destroy all of us, that they could just let 2000 years pass without really something happening to the protagonist, that this kind of suffering will never end, that stuck with me. I enjoyed watching this movie very much and even after all these years I remembered it quite well. But I am not sure what it is, if we leave we philosophy behind, what makes this movie so surreal. After watching it you feel like nothing is real for a little while.

I've had this feeling 3 times now. The first one was Dickens' David Copperfield. It took me a while to get the early part of David's life out of my head. 
The second one was, Sheldon's Doomsday conspiracy (Bellamy's separation), If Tomorrow Comes (Whitney's tragic jail life) and The Sands of Time ( Graciella's going back to nunhood).
The third time arguably is this blasphemous, jarring, scarring movie.

Martin - ""These things do look better in pieces"" me thinking 'what on earth this boy already loving vandalism at such a young age'. 

if I had to adopt either Martin or David I'd choose David. 

that Martin brat, insisting David to ""cut off someone's hair"" .... seriously that's the mindset of a boy who will grow up to be a psychopath or something. There are plenty of other ways to fight for love....

 really, Martin. David's not human. he cannot think like a real person and if the ""cut off a bit of Monica's hair"" went wrong, wrong? 

David could've either killed her or she'd need to go to the hospital. 

Scissors are NEVER toys when they are used on a human body in a sinister way..

David is a human being God's Sent Child, not a 'robot,' and inert things such as computer systems using any kind of electromagnetic radiation cannot think at all.
When I was in 5th grade, there was a poem regarding telephone cords wrapped around someone about technology given way too much credit.
This film goes even further, scaring a last little boy with computer info science gigahertz high speed 'flash cards,' that use databases with predictive causation deterministic outcomes as an evil harmful wicked pretense.
The Promises Of God Are Always Kept, as a Rock.  This movie certainly alludes to houses falling built on sand, (ref. The Holy Bible in one of Jesus The Christ's Parables), so any kind of, in reality, 'science fiction,' by built up collectivist elitist of God's Granted Graced Studied Disciplines, Fields, and any, every, partly Venues propaganda exalting human beings abilities as 'God-like' to control others in a 1984ish Big Gentleman with Lady, open or secret oligarchical societies will in the end be doomed to failure.

God Is Perfectly Benevolent, All Good, All Just, Gives All True Peace, Precepts, Laws, Ordinances Ways of  Gifts, such as, Child-like Simplistic Wisdom, Virtues, such as, Hope, and Fruits such as observed God's Sent Always Morality.
