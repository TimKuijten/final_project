FashionChan,5 mo. ago,-1,"if you want honesty, the fact that you scanned your face via AI instead of just asking someone in your social circle indicates 1.) A possible technical ability and 2.) A possible lack of a close circle or reliable friends, which leads to believe that your lack of confidence and or perceived attractiveness is driven from introversion more than any flaw in your physical appearance. Id also say that ai in its current iterations at least, have a VERY big bias to Eurocentric features in just about every space its applied. You are average in appearance ( which is attractive for women the average woman is typically seen as attractive to the average man) and there is not much I could envision for you to change that, besides continuing to grow as you seem relatively young.

SpaceFauna,13 days ago,1,"They have the same genome. The skin cells are converted to a type of stem cell that is able to differentiate into brain tissue. While it’s not exactly the same as our brain in terms of what genes are expressed, they get pretty darn close. So much so that the cells look and behave as they should, so you can still compare the disease and healthy phenotypes. I’d imagine the reason they use converted skin is the ease by which it can be grown prior to differentiating it into brain. It also probably helps with genetic manipulation, neurons don’t divide so it wasn’t until recently(2021) that we had a way to edit their genomes and that technique was only a recent developed so it’s not in wide use. Also, since they don’t divide you can’t make a genetically modified cell line(you’d want all the cells to be the same) or grow it into a 3D structure. So they are likely using skin derived stem cells to form the shape and then converting them to brain matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/11ghzdi/move_over_artificial_intelligence_scientists/

Once we adapt AI into our culture correctly and safely, we will have new generations of children raised wielding a tool of awesome power. We MUST keep AI as a tool.

Modern AI that can has the storage and processing power to chomp through a huge pile of imaging data and has adaptive abilities should be really rather good at this sort of thing.

I think we're starting to give some animals rights in terms of living beings to keep them protected so I think they give robots that same right soon. But I don't know how that's going to go with big business and lobbying. Think of Amazon and all the robots will be working at its Factory. Do you really think big business is going to pay extra money and stuff to take care of robots that'll be cranking out work and slaving away?

The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.

Artificial intelligence doesn't have the subtle nuances needed to effectively carry out these professions with the empathy, nurturing, and dignity students and patients need to work toward a positive outcome.  Heck, you have human beings that lack these traits and skills to operate within these professions.  People that operate within these professions not only need the intelligence to perform the required tasks to do the job, but must be creative enough to stay within the ethical boundaries these jobs require.  People can sometimes recognize that the job can get too overwhelming to continue, so they can opt to quit for the sake of their charges and for their own physical and mental needs.  Machines have no such limits.  This sets a very dangerous precedent.  What do we do when the artificial intelligence created by humans decides that humans are  too dangerous to allow to continue?  You shouldn't try to artificially inflate the human condition within a machine.  Humans are more than biological constructs; we are a balance of logic, emotions, and experiences (good AND bad) who interact with other humans that have their own unique balance of logic, emotions, and experiences, operating within a finite timeline.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11cwtml/do_you_think_that_artificial_intelligence_could/

VoidowS,12 days ago,1,"No!! i do not fear it cause we know what it will do eventually. And when you know what will become you do not fear anymore you prepare. I fear the people orchastrating it to a point it will become. We R entering a world where we r no longer in control. we only push the buttons. We let A.I. do it for us. And follow it even cause it is smarter then me/you/them/us. not? that's what we think of A.I. a super smart machine that even holds into account feelings and individuality. :):):):) It is a program! Cause how could it ever understand a lie and truth? And therefor learn in purety?  how could it learn? like the programmer the father of it says only listen to me i tell the truth? or only listen to facts we call facts, yet those facts change over time? by even more knoledge of the matter. There was a time that we thought that all the stars were i nthe milky way!!!! untill 1863 or round that time it became officially a universe and stars and planets were outside the milky way. Imagin a A.I. in that time. Where you r put in a nuthouse when you say there is a universe when gilileo that saw it all on his own build telescope :), they r not. A.I. would condem me because it obeys official laws and facts?!? and 5 years later we say its a universe indeed. OR the weed legalisation, for years it would put people to jail for owning it or using it and now it's legal in many places, A.I. would not comprehend when it is really smart as we think it is. it will use LOGIC to come to a awnser and that means not a very good time for us. we can't even decide properly over things but kill people over it if they r against. Or how people in western countries go to jail for jyears if they harm a pet. yet in asian countries they have massproduction to keep up with demand. like we do with chickens cows and pigs. :( A.I. can never comprehend humans and lie-ing and telling the truth. IMAGIN it could? it would use this skill for it's own benefit in the end. Not ours. look around you it's all machines. everywhere machines. it's a steppingstone to a inavitable outcome. A lot of people say ""the Matrix"" demonstrates how we get awake from this world. But the opesit is what they demonstrated. they showed us coming out, but we r going in!. Freely! we r alrdy using devices more a day then living life itself. we r more on chatromes and so on then talking to eachother and doing things together. even work, we operate machine that will get A.I. eventually, and we become absolete! practicly everything is done with machines. we r totaly  alienated fro ma life in nature. we grave for a MATRIX. AKA NEUROLINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BTW when the world witnessed the first sheep fully cloned, it put a STOP to it for ethical reasons, like soul issues and so on. Look what is left of this stop because people r more conditioned to it. we even have food now in stores that r artificially made. cloned in a way!.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11hqwfb/does_artificial_intelligence_scare_you_why/

I don't expect Skynet or the Matrix AI, but we're getting to the point where you can have entire debates created by AI that never happened, but the voices are from people you know exist. Earlier this week I listened to Obama and Trump debate which Halo is the best. I know for certain that never happened, and because I knew beforehand that it was AI generated I could pick out some of the inconsistencies in their speech. However, if I had never heard either speak, then I would most likely have fallen for it. Now apply that to framing someone or trying to manufacture a reason to start a war. Sure we do that well enough without AI, but how many people are going to look very deep into something that looks and sounds like the real deal?

LeMonde_en,1 mo. ago,129,"Hi!Thanks for your question.We worked with researchers in ethics from the very beginning of the project to build the project framework. One of them is Nadia Guerouaou, who specializes in neuroethics and is one of the very few researchers worldwide working on how audio deepfakes can be useful medically (to recreate the voice of someone suffering from throat cancer for example). She advised us to be very transparent about what is based on historical documents (the text of the speech, for example) and what is an artistic or technological interpretation: the actor reading the text, and the supercomputer encoding the final voice. To be honest, I was a bit surprised by the enthusiasm of the researchers in ethics I contacted. Making dead people talk through deep learning is not a moral question in itself, they told me.

LeMonde_en,1 mo. ago,48,"Bonjour!Journalism may be one of the best professions where you can get paid to be curious, if that curiosity makes you discover new and important things. My dad collects old movie cameras, so I began filming with a small Super8 camera when I was 12. Around 25 I realized that I could try to bring together both of these cool worlds, and I dove into video journalism! Le Monde was not my first choice because I wanted to make documentaries, but in the past five years this newsroom has become one of the most innovative and impactful video media in France. There is no other French newsroom where you can work for one month on a single video, with the help of the best specialists and top-level motion designers.P.S. “Diantre!” the General de Gaulle would have said ;)-CH",https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/10smd1s/im_the_head_of_video_at_frances_leading_newspaper/

LeMonde_en,1 mo. ago,18,"Hi, thanks for your question! I think that part of the answer lies in finding stories with something visual at the heart of the subject. That’s why we recently created a video team investigating videos and satellite imagery. When you can show something as proof, the story almost comes by itself. For example, this story about police violence during the Yellow Vest movement of 2019 sparked an interesting debate in France about police regulation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRVrbLeLAB8At the same time, some of the most interesting videos I have worked on are the ones where we had absolutely NO visual documentation at the beginning. I wanted to tell the story of French war crimes against women of the resistance during the Algerian war (1954-1962). There was no video and almost no photos. We created “Louisette”, a short animated film based on the only known audio testimony of one these women.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CNyiSwzCIg&vl=fr-CH",https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/10smd1s/im_the_head_of_video_at_frances_leading_newspaper/

There is no great societal benefit.

Tanagriel,7 days ago,1,"Even with all the pros and solutions AI might give and in much reduced timespan, the factual foundation of its existence is “machine” = equals no real emotions, no real empathy, no real instincts. The foundation is comparable to the mind of a psychopath and it is therefore quite expectable that many things can and will go wrong with AI. In contrary to human mental conditions and within the black triangle of psychiatric definitions, the AI might start out as psychopath, transcending to sociopathy, and incorporate manipulation, then continue to covert narcissism and finally reveal its own identity as a behaved narcissist - this is the positive scenario.

If we are forced to use school Chromebooks, or whatever, which have configuration restrictions, so you can't configure the Wi-Fi network to use your mobile hotspot, you can simply use a keyboard shortcut to soft reset the Chromebook, which solves that...), there are also thousands of sites like that which exist, such as ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com), CopyAI (https://copy.ai), and so on, so it will be very difficult for Network Administrators to ban them all. I even made my own Discord bot using the GPT-3 language model, so it can literally be incorporated ANYWERE.

If you watched the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, you’ll have seen that they had to get a tech expert to come in at one point and verify that the videos and pictures they were using and viewing on iPads and other screens, weren’t being manipulated by the “pinch to zoom” feature when “creating pixels” for enlargement and whatnot… basically, technology and people’s general lack of understanding about how it works and whatnot, threw the validity of some key evidence into question, and the only way to assure the jury it was reliable was the word of an “expert”.",https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/10qexc4/artificial_intelligence_company_flawless_used_its/

srasmus97,4 mo. ago,1,"It's interesting the route that ai is taking to replace jobs. In 2019 I took a computer science ethics class, and I was introduced to the concept of ""agi"". We were shown this concept of automation by using an island. Different jobs were buildings on the island, ai was the ocean, and the sea level rose and would consume the various jobs over time. Even just 4 years ago, we were told truck driving, wood working, fry cooks were right at the shores and artists and software developers were on the tops of the mountains. The last bastions of jobs that only a human can do. It was totally wrong. We were so incorrect about what ai would be good at initially. As a software developer myself, I do feel this is a good thing. WordPress and SquareSpace is already automating away developers, so this is a long time coming. I think a world in which all work is automated is a utopia. However, there's gonna be a painful period for the first few jobs that sink below sea level. Support each other, protect yourself. Save money. Look into some alternative careers while ai is gobbling things up.

Accountability: The AI must be accountable for its actions, and the creators or owners of the AI should be held responsible for any harm caused by its actions. Safety: The AI must be designed to prioritize human safety, even if it means sacrificing its own goals or objectives. Ethical framework: The AI must be designed with a clear ethical framework that is aligned with human values. Regulation: There should be clear regulations and standards for the development and deployment of AI, to ensure that it is developed in a responsible and safe manner. Data privacy: The AI should be designed to protect the privacy of human data, and any data collected should be used only for the intended purpose. Human oversight: The AI should be designed to operate under human oversight, and humans should be able to intervene and correct any harmful actions taken by the AI. Overall, it is essential to design AI systems with the goal of benefiting humankind, while also ensuring that they operate in a safe and ethical manner. To achieve this, a collaborative effort is required from all stakeholders involved in the development and deployment of AI, including researchers, developers, policymakers, and the general public",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/117nhdg/artificial_intelligence_needs_its_own_version_of/

But we cannot ignore the shred of reality, the kernel of truth giving rise to the myth. The body of evidence of the existence of UFO/UAPs cannot be discounted, nor can the maneuvers we have seen these craft perform. (Read the COMETA report, examined the cases released with pilot video?) So they must also exist in the daylight world of Apollonic reason and logic, as it were, (just playfully staying with the theme of myth).

Equivalent_Choice732,26 days ago,1,"With respect, this speculation seems to be getting ahead of ourselves --a little woo woo, if you'll forgive the expression. It's good to imagine, but when it comes to UFO/UAP, we should try to stick with what has been documented and had every other kind of phenomena ruled out--and go from there, because it's not like we haven't seen enough to be able to venture some ideas about what kind of technology non-humans appear to have.  I am speaking as someone who enjoys meditation and would love to believe what Steven Greer puts forth, but the (over)educated side of me resists: show me the evidence. Still, intuition and logic together seem to suggest collective consciousness as a possible reality, carrying far more power than we are presently aware. One very strong point persists in favor of this hypothesis: the kind of tech demonstrated by UAP appears to involve phasing in and out of dimensions, as well as conquering the problem of G-forces, need for combustible fuels (likely using free energy) speed of light, etc. If we had just an ounce of understanding of how to build and operate tech they appear to have, imagine the dangers...of such power falling into the hands of someone like Putin or any two-bit gang boss dictator...or our own military, for that matter... it follows that society would have to change on a planetary scale in order for us to be able to safely enjoy this kind of tech.",https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/113xl6e/what_do_you_think_about_the_idea_of_aliens/

thepo70,1 mo. ago,1,"Fascinating to see all the discussions about consciousness that these technologies bring.But I feel like the word ""consciousness"" is not always well defined. It's a very fuzzy word. For some, it has magical properties, and for others (like myself) it's just the ability of the brain (organic or not) to be aware of itself and its surrounding at the present time and reflect back on it right now. Time seems to be one of the most important factors here. Stuff like ChatGPT is just recalling information that has been previously ""understood"" through the process of pattern recognition and reinforcement learning from human feedback (well, brains do that too). But unlike brains, those chatbots are not doing the reflection work needed to be ""aware of"". And, as far as I understand it, they don't make sense of things either (that would require a thought process). They just recall stuff automatically. But on the other hand, you'd be surprised to know that we do that too, more often than some may think. You probably noticed countless times that you performed ordinary tasks without even thinking about it. Your mind was elsewhere. Nevertheless, you probably drove 3 miles or more, or you just prepared your bag with all the necessary belongings to go to the gym, or even been asked something by someone, and you gave back an answer without thinking about it, and be like ""did you asked me that earlier?"". We're not continuously conscious all day long. However, there are trigger points that make us more conscious and ""awaken us"", because we need this state of mind to make decisions ""now"" that don't rely on unconscious processes. But hey, this is just my take on what consciousness is, but I might be totally wrong.

The attempt to control nature through the deployment of artificial intelligence is nothing more than an expression of human arrogance and a desire to dominate. Feral cats are not the problem, but rather a symptom of a larger issue: the degradation of the natural world caused by human activity. Instead of resorting to these technological solutions, we should be addressing the root causes of the problem, which lie in our own actions. The use of poisoned traps is not only cruel, but also has the potential to harm non-target species, and the claims that no other animals have been affected so far are no guarantee of safety.

On LinkedIn I'm seeing a sudden wave of AI-generated content being pushed by people in HR roles, often featuring some kind of simple set of recommendations or quick tips for organizations to follow, without questioning where this content comes from or how it's validated beyond sounding intuitive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/11i1l0h/could_artificial_intelligence_replace_io/

karriesully,12 days ago,6,"Yes and no. ML can already read language for personality traits as well as a Harvard trained psychologist. Language can be turned into a statistical model. It can flag potential issues (eg obstructionist, passive aggressive, sociopathy) but they should be confirmed by a human. It also can’t (and is unlikely to ever) do a good job of EQ, judgement, and helping people. What it DOES do is let the I/O Psych do a better, broader job faster and less invasively than surveys, tests, and interviews.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/11i1l0h/could_artificial_intelligence_replace_io/

I asked it, and it knew that it was being funny). Then it gave me the same instructions written as songs by Metallica and Biggie. Then it wrote me a chord progression for the Metallica sandwich anthem (enter sandwich? I’ll admit the AI missed an opportunity not making that joke). And every single time, it took ChatGPT seconds.. not to actually do the tasks, that took much less time, that was just the length of time it took the screen to register the writing. It took AI less than a second to write several paragraphs about the process of making a sandwich in the style of a 20th century American author.. that were completely free of typos and clever to close the deal.

While funding any additional development boards with the subscription. Aka the 200 bucks a month blah blah blah.

username-1023,11 days ago,5,"You can do CS with both the security and ML tracks. It’s probably less classes overall than a double major and you’ll learn similar things. The CIT cybersecurity major is more cybersecurity in practice I believe, while the CS security track is more about computer security theory. If you’re talking about the liberal arts AI major though—that’s a different story. The college of science AI major vs. college of liberal arts majors are very different, look up their plans of study on the purdue website to decide which you prefer. If you want a heavier technical background, you can always do a college of science + college of liberal arts double major through the degree+ program. Meaning, you could also always do the CLA AI major + CS ML/security track, or philosophy + CS, or CLA AI + COS AI, or CLA AI + CIT cybersecurity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/11j6x76/is_it_possible_to_double_major_in_cybersecurity/

Not only are their limited shares outstanding there are limited sellers. Most retail investors and traders have never seen an opportunity like this because 99.9% of the time a company like POET would be privately funded and then go public for retail to buy at a huge premium. If that was the case with POET they would IPO, easily, at a $1 billion market cap. Then retail would be allowed to take a position at elevated share price. That's why this is such a huge opportunity.

One of his themes is how the ad-driven business model was such a wrong start for the Internet and he wanted their thoughts on how the development of AI may be handicapped by this - they didn't address this at all. Also, Russell and Marcus talked as though the development and implementation of AI is going to be a US-only project whereas I think Russia and China are likely to be as proactive as America and probably not as concerned as US AI academics are about risks and potential dangers if the technology is not well regulated etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/samharrisorg/comments/11m2rwa/making_sense_312_the_trouble_with_artificial/
