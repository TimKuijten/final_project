Thomas Eusemann,7,1 comment,1 repost,"Ich bin stolz darauf, dass wir uns bei Senseason aktiv für Nachhaltigkeit und Umweltschutz einsetzen. Wir sind immer auf der Suche nach innovativen Lösungen, um unseren ökologischen Fußabdruck zu reduzieren. Der RecYcape Friseurumhang von TrendDesign ist ein großartiges Beispiel dafür, wie man Nachhaltigkeit in die Friseurbranche integrieren kann. Mit dem RecYcape wird nicht nur Abfall vermieden, sondern auch ein Rohstoff genutzt, der ansonsten ungenutzt bleiben würde. Das zeigt, wie wichtig es ist, die Vorteile der Kreislaufwirtschaft zu nutzen und den Wert von Materialien zu maximieren.Dieser Umhang bietet nicht nur eine nachhaltige Alternative zu herkömmlichen Friseurumhängen, sondern ist auch besonders komfortabel und funktional. Der fließende Stoff leitet Haare ab und der Schneideumhang ist atmungsaktiv – perfekt für den Einsatz im Salon.Wie bereits erwähnt, wird Nachhaltigkeit in der heutigen Zeit immer wichtiger und das betrifft nicht nur Unternehmen, sondern auch die Mitarbeiter. Bei Senseason sind nachhaltige Produkte nicht nur eine unternehmerische Entscheidung, sondern auch eine Herzensangelegenheit der Mitarbeiter. Sie möchten ihren Beitrag zum Umweltschutz leisten und sind stolz darauf, in einem Unternehmen zu arbeiten, das diese Werte teilt.Es ist wichtig, dass Unternehmen und Mitarbeiter gemeinsam an einem Strang ziehen, um nachhaltige Entscheidungen zu treffen.

For discovery-stage initiatives, emphasize user knowledge and domain expertise. For optimizing and scaling, look for technical depth and data-driven decision-making.- Develop technical knowledge in domain-expert PMs by pairing them with AI technologists during planning. Develop user empathy in more technical PMs with data analysis of usage patterns, and pairing them with user research teams.- Many AI initiatives have been technology led, leading to a bias to hiring AI technologists as PMs rather than upskilling domain experts or optimization-focused PMs in AI. Organizations need to invest in developing AI knowledge in their product teams to fully take advantage of the latest innovations in AI.hashtag#productmanagement#ai",1 hour ago

That's why it's crucial to have a realistic mindset and approach from the get-go.I've seen too many working relationships crumble due to unrealistic expectations, such as hiring the cheapest assistant, expecting instant results without training, or thinking you don't have enough work for them.The harsh truth is that the trial period may not be smooth sailing at first, but that's okay! Take the time to invest in building a strong foundation and communication with your assistant. Be patient, provide clear feedback, and work together to find the best ways to support each other. And bosses, remember that being involved in your assistant's onboarding process is crucial for their success.In the end, if you want a great assistant, you must be a great leader.

Eine erfolgreiche Integration von KI in den Industrieprozess erfordert einen interdisziplinären Austausch zwischen verschiedenen Parteien und kann mit Aufwand verbunden sein. Um die Vorteile von KI optimal zu nutzen, sollten Unternehmen nicht nur ihre Fähigkeit zur Datensammlung und -haltung einsetzen, sondern auch den Austausch zwischen Datenerzeugern und -nutzern fördern (Data Mesh). Es empfiehlt sich, KI bereits bei der Prozessentwicklung zu berücksichtigen und wenn möglich zu integrieren, um ihre zukünftige Einbindung zu erleichtern.

Over 20 years later, I still think about the example he set.1) He helped clean the clubYes, there was a cleaning schedule. But, he wasn't above grabbing a vacuum or wiping down machines. It wasn't so he could say, ""look what's not getting done."" It was to improve the customer experience and to help his team members.2) He spent time with each employeeWithout interrupting the customer or client experience, he made sure to approach every employee, to introduce himself to new employees, or to reconnect with those of greater tenure. He knew our names, recent contributions & achievements, took time to understand our goals, to offer advice, and ask for our feedback. He wasn't just approachable - he made the approach.3) He spent time with membersSpend enough time somewhere and it's easy to take for granted what customers look for and experience. Visit a club once a quarter (or less) and you need a few more eyes to help. Understanding what the members saw, heard, felt, and experienced was critical. Rather than reading about it in a suggestion box or online form, he went to the source with authentic care and curiosity.Management isn't easy. Leadership is even tougher. But, small habits, exercised consistently, can influence organizational culture. And, they can influence individual employees - enough so that the lessons remain intact decades later.",

I would love to express my gratitude to him as well for such a wonderful session.He talked about the enormous potential of the autonomous world to make or break the modern era. The prime focus of the session was on a part of AI that we sometimes shy away from talking about, which is ""What Can Possibly Go Wrong?""AI is largely statistical, and its reliability can sometimes be questionable. He elaborated on the common pitfalls of ML modeling, including how crucial it is to obtain the right training data and how over-generalization of models can be bad.ML systems are happy to be biased if it means producing good results. It's astonishing to see how Algorithmic bias and Societal bias can show up in ML models. These biases in autonomous systems can be catastrophic and it is critical that we are careful with the handling of systems like these.The human-machine interaction is growing exponentially, and it's high time we look at the other side of the coin, which is AI .Tony Dahburaposed an intriguing question: ""If humans should have the right to know when they are interacting with a machine.

Ahmadreza Sazegarnejad,5,,,"There is a lot to discuss about ethical AI, this is a simple one:From the text:“When you text your friend a joke and they reply with three tears-of-joy emojis, your body responds with endorphins and oxytocin as you revel in the knowledge that your friend is amused.Our instinctive reaction to AI-generated emojis is likely to be the same, even though there is no human emotion at the other end. We can be deceived into responding to, and feeling empathy for, an inanimate object.”And also:“My worry is that, without appropriate safeguards, such technology could undermine people’s autonomy. AIs that ‘emote’ could induce us to make harmful mistakes by harnessing the power of our empathic responses. The dangers are already apparent. When one ten-year-old asked Amazon’s Alexa for a challenge, it told her to touch a penny to a live electrical outlet. Luckily, the girl didn’t follow Alexa’s advice, but a generative AI could be much more persuasive. Less dramatically, an AI could shame you into buying an expensive product you don’t want. You might think that would never happen to you, but a 2021 study found that people consistently underestimated how susceptible they were to misinformation.”",3 hours ago

Abdullahi Abdulbasid,0,,,"""Natural Language Processing: The Future of Communication"":Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP is enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, thus making communication between humans and machines more seamless.NLP has many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated systems such as Siri and Alexa. These systems use NLP to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. NLP can also be used to analyze large amounts of textual data, such as social media posts, emails, and customer reviews.One of the key challenges in NLP is understanding the nuances of human language, such as idioms, sarcasm, and context. NLP systems must be able to understand the meaning behind words and phrases, and interpret them correctly. This requires the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, to process and analyze large amounts of data.Another important aspect of NLP is natural language generation, which involves using AI to generate human-like language. This technology can be used in various applications, such as writing news articles, creating chatbot responses, and generating personalized emails.NLP is also being used in healthcare to analyze medical records and patient data to improve diagnosis and treatment. NLP systems can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to humans. This can help healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans.Overall, NLP has the potential to transform the way we communicate with machines and each other. As NLP technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see more widespread adoption of chatbots, virtual assistants, and other NLP applications in our daily lives. NLP is poised to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, customer service, and marketing.In conclusion, NLP is a rapidly growing field that is revolutionizing the way we communicate with machines. As NLP technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more advanced and sophisticated applications of this technology in various industries. NLP has the potential to make communication more seamless, efficient, and personalized, thereby improving our overall quality of life.#machinelearning#data#ai#healthcare#artificialintelligence#medical",3 hours ago

Alexander Steiner,3,2 comments,,"𝗥𝗣𝗔 𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲! ❌Seit Jahrzehnten bekommen wir das Versprechen, dass wir Befehle nicht mehr als Code eingeben müssen.Hierfür gab es schon die unterschiedlichsten Ansätze, die natürlich über die Zeit hin immer besser und ausgefeilter wurden.  🙌Alternativen für die Command Line sollen nach dem Willen der Entwickler unter anderem sein:🔹 Die grafische Benutzeroberfläche (GUI), die durch Icons, Buttons und Menüs die Interaktion mit dem Computer erleichtert und weniger technisches Wissen erfordert als die Command Line.🔹 Die ""Natural Language Interfaces"", die es ermöglichen, den Computer in natürlicher Sprache zu steuern, ähnlich wie man mit einem menschlichen Gesprächspartner sprechen würde.🔹 Und nicht zu vergessen Sprachassistenten wie Siri, Google Assistant und Alexa. Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt. Letztendlich ist es nur ein Werkzeug, keine Philosophie oder Wissenschaft.Was ist Deine Meinung dazu? ✍#rpa#digitalisierung#automatisierung#prozessautomation#mittelstand",4 hours ago

Le code de la copropriété est ton livre de chevet.Prend ton téléphone pour parler dès que le mail devient du tchat (les mails sont un fléau, souviens-toi que leur fonction initiale est d’envoyer des documents et des informations, pas à tchater).Va vers les gens et au-devant des problèmes avant qu’ils ne s’imposent à toi et finissent par t’envahir.N’hésite pas à poser plein de questions à tes collègues et aux autres professionnels, sur les chantiers ou dans les procédures, chacun son métier, on en apprend tous les jours dans ce merveilleux métier.Prends du recul et ne prends surtout pas les attaques à titre personnel, tout cela n’est qu’un grand théâtre.Recadre les copropriétaires qui parlent mal, ils ont besoin de ça. Le syndic restera toujours une figure d’autorité, c’est ce qu’ils recherchent pour gérer leur vie en collectivité même s’ils ne le reconnaîtront jamais.Ne te défais jamais de ton professionnalisme, exprime-toi naturellement et simplement quand tu t’adresses aux copropriétaires et aux entreprises. Parle vrai.Tu auras des hauts et des bas niveau moral, c’est normal.Voilà, aime les gens et dis-toi que tu as le droit de râler, on le fait tous pour évacuer la pression.

Nazmul Hassan,0,,,"Search engine optimization (SEO) is constantly evolving as search engines like Google refine their algorithms and new technologies emerge. Here are some possible trends that could shape the future of SEO:Focus on user intent: As search engines become more sophisticated, they are better able to understand the intent behind a user's search query. This means that optimizing for keywords alone is no longer enough. Instead, SEO will increasingly be about understanding what users are looking for and providing them with relevant content and experiences.Importance of voice search: With the rise of smart speakers and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, voice search is becoming more prevalent. SEO strategies will need to adapt to the unique challenges and opportunities of voice search, such as optimizing for natural language queries and local search.Emphasis on mobile-first indexing: More and more people are accessing the internet on their mobile devices, which has led to Google shifting towards mobile-first indexing. This means that websites that are not optimized for mobile devices may suffer in search rankings. SEO will need to prioritize mobile optimization to ensure visibility in search results.Integration with other channels: SEO is increasingly being integrated with other marketing channels, such as social media, email marketing, and content marketing. A holistic approach that considers how SEO fits into the larger marketing picture will be important.Overall, the future of SEO will likely continue to be shaped by advancements in technology and changes in user behavior. SEO professionals will need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and adapt their strategies accordingly to remain effective.#searchengines#seo#marketing#searchengineoptimization#contentmarketing#technology",6 hours ago

Der#APIZugang ist leider noch nicht voll möglich, wird aber in den nächsten Tagen folgen.Was ist anders? Die Qualität hat sich deutlich gesteigert, höherer „Faktengenauigkeit“, die Textausgaben sind menschlicher und nicht so gleichmäßig wie vorher. Wobei ihr das auch per Eingabeaufforderung selber steuern könnt.Ich kann also auch einen Text für einen Viertklässler, in Reimform oder mit bestimmten Buchstaben- / Satzkonstruktionen umschreiben lassen. Auch eine Ausgabe in sehr einfacher Sprache ist möglich.Was sehr spannend ist: ich kann verschiedene Medien als Input nutzen. Ein Beispiel: Ich nutze ein Foto von allen Lebensmitteln die ich habe, und frage was ich damit für Gerichte kochen kann. Ich bekomme so eine Liste mit Gerichten und kann mir daraus dann ein Rezept aussuchen.Ich kann ebenfalls eine Toneingabe nutzen, bekomme als quasi einen (halben) Voicebot wie Alexa direkt mitgeliefert.Noch interessanter: Stimmungen von Menschen können eingefangen werden, wenn ihr Fotos als Eingabe verwendet.Wenn ich also weiß, dass jemand gerade wütend oder traurig ist, kann ich ihm einen Inhalt anders zur Verfügung stellen, als wenn er glücklich oder positiv aufgeregt ist.Aber was hat das alles mit#sparkassezu tun?Wir wollen eine völlig neue Art des Kundendialogs schaffen, der nur mit dem Einsatz von#KImöglich ist, und uns ermöglicht unsere 40.000.000 Kunden sehr emotionalisiert anzusprechen.

There are many organizational problems that won't be solved even by the most fantastically awesome learning professionals.Training can only solve problems that stem from a lack of knowledge or skills.Many stakeholders, however, assume that the problem IS a lack of knowledge or skill when actually, it is not. They don't have the time to do the analysis and/or they are too close to the situation.That means, if we are going to make the most of company time and resources, we must do the analysis before blindly saying yes to a request, as much as possible. If training won't solve the problem, we owe it to the organization to suggest alternatives.Here are six problems that training cannot solve.Click into the full article to read about real life examples of each from my own experiences.Problems training cannot solve:1).

RiseUpp,2,,,"EVERYTHING YOU DO NOW, AI WILL DO FOR YOUArtificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way since its inception and has now become an integral part of our daily lives. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI has impacted various industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail, among others. As AI continues to evolve, it's becoming more apparent that it has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more.Let's take a closer look at some of the jobs that AI can do, both simple and advanced:Simple Jobs:👉 Data Entry: AI algorithms can be programmed to recognize and input data from various sources, including forms, surveys, and spreadsheets.👉 Customer Service: Chatbots and virtual assistants can handle basic customer inquiries and support tasks.👉 Social Media Management: AI can analyze social media trends, create posts, and even respond to comments and messages.👉 Personal Shopping: AI can analyze shopping behaviour and preferences to make personalized recommendations for users.👉 Traffic Control: AI can help manage traffic patterns by monitoring traffic flow and suggesting alternative routes in real-time.Advanced Jobs:👉 Medical Diagnosis: AI can analyze medical images and data to help doctors diagnose diseases and conditions.👉 Legal Research: AI algorithms can analyze legal documents and cases to assist lawyers with research and case preparation.👉 Financial Analysis: AI can analyze financial data to help investors make informed decisions.👉 Creative Writing: AI can generate creative writing, including articles, poetry, and even entire novels.👉 Robotics: AI-powered robots can perform complex tasks, including assembling products and performing surgical procedures.While AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve our lives, there are also concerns about its impact on the job market. As AI becomes more advanced, it's likely to take over many jobs that were traditionally performed by humans. However, it's important to note that AI is not here to replace humans, but rather to assist and augment human capabilities.To prepare for the future of work, it's essential to embrace the potential of AI and focus on developing skills that complement what AI can do. This includes developing critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence, which are all skills that AI cannot replicate.In conclusion, AI has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more.

VinBigData,5,,,"[English below]💁🏻‍♀️ TẠI SAO PHẦN LỚN TRỢ LÝ ẢO ĐỀU ĐƯỢC MẶC ĐỊNH LÀ GIỌNG NÓI CỦA NỮ GIỚI?Hãy thử nói chuyện với bất kì trợ lý ảo nào mà bạn có xung quanh mình, cho dù là Siri, Alexa hay Cortana thì rất nhiều khả năng sẽ có một giọng nói nữ giới trả lời các yêu cầu của bạn. Điều này là chỉ là sự ngẫu nhiên hay có một lí do nào đó phía sau?Mặc dù hầu hết các trợ lý ảo đều có thể được cài đặt tuỳ chỉnh sao cho phù hợp với yêu cầu của người sử dụng nhưng mặc định trợ lý ảo trên các thiết bị sẽ là giọng nữ. Điều này đơn giản là vì con người ta có xu hướng ưa chuộng giọng nữ giới nói hơn, một nghiên cứu khoa học đã chỉ ra rằng giọng nữ giới tạo cảm giác mềm mại, dịu dàng. Hơn nữa vì chúng ta được tiếp xúc với giọng của nữ giới ngay từ khi còn ở trong bụng mẹ nên sẽ cảm thấy gần gũi, thân quen hơn.Một nghiên cứu khác cũng chỉ ra rằng phụ nữ có thể phát âm những nguyên âm rõ ràng hơn nam giới, qua đó góp phần truyền tải chính xác thông tin giúp cho giọng nữ trở nên dễ nghe hơn. Những lý do trên đã khiến cho giọng nói nữ giới trở thành sự lựa chọn hàng đầu để áp dụng cho các trợ lý ảo.Với Trợ lý ảo VinFast được phát triển bởi VinBigData, người dùng có thể giao tiếp tự nhiên thông qua 4 giọng tiêu chuẩn (nam/nữ miền Bắc và nam/nữ miền Nam) là các MC/BTV nổi tiếng của VTV. Tuy nhiên, giọng nói mặc định trong lần đầu “làm quen” cùng xe được lựa chọn là giọng đọc của BTV Hoài Anh - một trong những nữ MC “quốc dân” của Việt Nam.Còn các bạn thấy sao? Giọng nam hay nữ sẽ “nịnh tai” các bạn hơn? Để lại comment/reaction bên dưới nhé!------------Trải nghiệm hệ sinh thái của VinBigData:→ Website:https://vinbigdata.com/→ Linkedin:https://bit.ly/3g7IhDQ→ Youtube:https://bit.ly/3vMS88X→ Blog:https://lnkd.in/dMgbeqNh------------💁🏻‍♀️ WHY ARE VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS' VOICES MOSTLY FEMALE?Try talking to any virtual assistant around you, whether it's Siri, Alexa, or Cortana, chances are a female voice will answer your requests. Is this just a coincidence or is there a reason behind it?Although most virtual assistants can be customized to suit the user's wants, the default selection will mostly be female. This is simply because humans prefer female voices, a scientific study has shown that female voices create a soft, gentle feeling. Moreover, we are exposed to female voices from the early stages of our lives hence we will feel closer and more familiar.Another study also showed that women can articulate vowels more clearly than men which makes female voices easier to hear. Therefore, female voices tend to be the first choice for virtual assistants.With VinFast Virtual Assistant developed by VinBigData, users can communicate naturally via 4 standard voices (Northern male/female and Southern male/female) which belong to renowned MCs of VTV. Especially, the default voice on Vinfast cars was dubbed by Hoai Anh - one of the ""national"" female MCs of Vietnam.Which voice is more like “the music to your ears”?

A mais nova versão da ferramenta do momento (e do futuro próximo aparentemente), o GPT-4. Trata-se de uma evolução da GPT-3.5, daOpenAI.Além de ter sido retreinada durante 6 meses com muito mais dados, o que mais me surpreendeu foi o fato da nova versão permitir o uso de imagens como input. No caso em questão, de uma simples anotação em um print (conforme imagem abaixo), ele foi capaz de gerar um website em HTML, atendendo as especificações.Acredito que é só o começo de uma infinidade de possibilidades de valor que as IA’s vão nos permitir gerar nos próximos anos.

Yeganeh Soltanpour,9,2 comments,,"In today's rapidly evolving world, change is inevitable. When faced with change, one can either embrace it and learn from it, or risk missing out on the benefits it offers. This is especially true when it comes to the advancements in technology, such as ChatGPT, BingAI, and other similar tools that are now making their way into the mainstream. While these tools have been around for some time, their recent acceptance by the wider public has been remarkable. Nonetheless, there is a certain apprehension surrounding the use of AI, given its potential for harm.However, the application of AI to perform routine or menial tasks, which are often prone to human error or negligence, is an exciting development. By linking ChatGPT to my Alexa, for instance, I was able to easily access relevant articles pertaining to my field (which is how I came across the linked article). This is just one example of how AI can be utilised to enhance efficiency and accuracy in our day-to-day activities.Looking ahead, it is possible to envision AI being utilised in student visa applications. The potential benefits such as limiting the number of mistakes made, sometimes by students or agents, which can lead to delays in visa processing times may be something we can reduce. It is an exciting prospect, and one that we should all keep an eye on as we move forward.#ai#Chatgpt#aiforgood",10 hours ago

She doesn’t want to go to school, mornings are very stressful for me. She has outbursts and tantrums getting ready for school and I don’t know what to do about it. I’m tired of lying to the school so she can go in late and get out early and miss school completely and I feel it’s only enabling her more. I understand and sympathize about how she feels but this is life and she needs to learn how to deal with it. Do I let her face the consequences of missing classes without my help do I continue to help and push her out the door? How can I navigate through this?",10 hours ago

Trip O'Dell,35,6 comments,,"As a designer, I find work like this ethically problematic.The robot is cute, but its designers are intentionally “playing” with a human cognitive bias where we treat things that look and behave like humans as if they are human.It was a line we were very careful not to cross when I was working at Amazon on Alexa. We even had a principle that “she” is a computer, not a person - because its very easy to wander into unethical areas when you have a device in your home that has your credit card number and can manipulate people who are lonely, or too trusting to act against their interests.As designers, a good bit of our work involves “lying” to users. A “user friendly” experience builds on familar metaphor, often representing functionality with a more familiar concept so people have an easier time using the software, and can anticipate how it might work.Consider the “trash can” on your computer, Its a helpful illusion for what happens to a file, but under the hood the root level command is something like “rm -i mydir/*”. The command is hard to remember, and requires a lot more advanced knowledge of the system to use it. So the illusion of a trash can, while innacurate, is a helpful illusion (lie) to help a normal user understand what’s happening.This isn’t the case here. The designers are creating an illusion of child-like behaviors, and eliciting our instinct to engage, nurture, play with and protect a child (notice the oversized head and big eyes?)…but its unclear why that’s necessary in this case, or to what end?This robot was developed by a multi-billion dollar corporation. Their business model depends on the “willing suspension of disbelief”. Disney needs us to love its characters and stories, to believe in “magic” and emotionally invest in their intellectual property to keep expensive theme parks and movie theaters filled, purchase their toys and subscribe to their services. They make great movies and world-class experiences but we know these things aren’t real. That isn’t what is happening here.The ethics of human-centered design requires we put people ahead of#technology, that the experiences we design are trustworthy, using metaphor and illusion only as a means to help users anticipate outcomes or understand the system they are working in.Disney is creating an illusion that evokes an emotional connection and engenders a sense of trust that the technology is incapable of  reciprocating. It can easily be used to manipulate us.Playing with our emotional response is uncomfortably close to the tactics used by con artists to prey on the trust and goodwill of their victims.This is an experiment, but corporations don’t sink millions into R&D with emotional connection as their ultimate goal.Be wary of technology that pretends to care about you. A gizmo can never “love” you back, and there is always a wizard behind the curtian (and a marketing team) pulling at those heart strings to see how much money comes out.",10 hours ago

Code6,0,,,"The Blink Video Doorbell is down to an all&time low of $35.Amazon has rolled out another sale on smart home devices from its Blink brand, bringing a range of video doorbells and security cameras back down to, or at least near, their lowest prices to date. If you're comfortable with the idea of having an Amazon camera outside of your home, one highlight is the Blink Video Doorbell for $35. That matches the device's all-time low, coming in $15 below Amazon's list price and about $10 off the average street price we've seen in recent months. If you're thinking of picking up a Blink cam for the first time, note that a bundle that pairs the Video Doorbell with the company's Sync Module 2 — which lets you view the camera's live feed on-demand and utilize local storage — is down to $59, which is about $15 off its usual going rate and $5 more than the best price we've tracked.Blink is essentially the budget counterpart to Amazon's other major smart home subsidiary, Ring. Its Video Doorbell is much more basic than a pricier option like Arlo's Essential Video Doorbell, the top pick from our guide to the best smart home devices, but it still delivers serviceable 1080p video, night vision and the ability to see and speak to people at your door regardless of where you are. The whole thing is relatively easy to install, and it can run off wired power or a couple of AA batteries. Blink says the device can get up to two years of juice, depending on how hard it's put into use.That said, the camera's field of view (135 degrees horizontal, 80 degrees vertical) isn't as wide as higher-end options, and it only works with Amazon's Alexa assistant, not alternative platforms like Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant or IFTTT. And while you don't need any add-ons, the doorbell's storage and live view options are limited without the Sync Module or one of Blink's subscription plans. Without the Module, you'll only receive alerts and a live view when the doorbell senses activity or someone presses its button. Still, this is a worthy option for those looking to install a competent, battery-powered doorbell cam for as little money as possible. Beyond the Video Doorbell, other notable deals include a two-camera kit of Blink's Outdoor security cam, another pick from our best smart home device guide, for $104. That's $5 more than the lowest price we've seen. The sale includes several bundles that mix and match various camera options as well.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget athttps://lnkd.in/gb2TGFmfhttps://lnkd.in/g8vW-uxH",11 hours ago

With AI's continued growth and development, it's clear that it's going to play an even more significant role in shaping our world in the years to come.From personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous cars and drones, AI is already making a huge impact in our everyday lives. And as the technology progresses, it's going to continue to revolutionize industries like healthcare, finance, transportation, and more.One of the most exciting things about the future of AI is its potential to help us solve some of the world's most pressing challenges. From climate change to healthcare, AI has the ability to process large amounts of data and generate insights that can help us make more informed decisions.Of course, with the great potential of AI comes responsibility. It's important that we continue to have discussions around AI ethics and make sure that the development of AI is guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and fairness.As professionals, it's essential that we stay up to date with the latest developments in AI and understand how it can be applied to our respective fields. By embracing AI and continuing to learn about its capabilities, we can ensure that we are well-positioned to thrive in the new age of technology.So let's stay curious and keep exploring the exciting possibilities of AI together!#AI#future#growth#healthcare#healthcare#finance#artificialintelligence#data#ai#transportation#climatechange#developmentI#futuretech#innovation#technology#machinelearning",12 hours ago

Alexa Cohen Bicknese,6,1 comment,,"IntroducingColin King's New Rug Collection withBeni Rugs: an Ode to Japan’s Influence on French ModernismIn 2021, while working on the French gallery Demish Damant’s A Harmony of Things”—an exhibit exploring the intersection of Japanese and French minimalism—the interior stylist Colin King had a lightbulb moment. Within the research process, the AD100 decorator dived deep into japonisme, the 18th-century French interpretation (and incorporation) of Japanese style. eAfter trade routes between the two countries opened following the period of sakoku, when Japan closed its borders to the Western world, French creatives were exposed to a restrained, uncluttered aesthetic entirely different from their own, typically more ornate design language. For the next decade, Japan would influence French modernists from Edgar Degas to Charlotte Perriand.King, who is based in New York City, was immediately fascinated. “It was a movement that radically transformed Europe’s visual culture and permeated fine arts, sculpture, performing arts, architecture, industrial and furniture design, interiors as well as textile and decorative arts,” he explains. “The Japanese elicited the French to question the division between artist and designer and moved them to elevate the contributions of craftsmen. This principle interested me as the melding of craft and contemporary design.”ACB CREATIVE",14 hours ago
