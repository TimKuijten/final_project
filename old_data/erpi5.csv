"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">As an artist, I am fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on the world of art. However, I also have some concerns and frustrations with the current state of AI in the art world.</h1>",oooooooooooh12,"Firstly, I worry about the devaluation of human creativity and talent. With AI becoming more advanced, it's possible that some people may view it as a replacement for human artists. While AI can certainly produce impressive works of art, it lacks the depth and emotional connection that comes from human creativity. Art is a reflection of the human experience, and it's important to recognize the value of human creativity and expression.Secondly, I am concerned about the potential for AI to perpetuate biases and reinforce existing societal inequalities. AI algorithms are only as objective as the data they are trained on, and if that data reflects societal biases, then the AI will replicate those biases in its output. This is already happening in fields such as facial recognition, where AI has been found to be less accurate for people with darker skin tones. As an artist, it's important to be aware of these biases and to work towards creating more inclusive and equitable art.Furthermore, the rise of AI-generated art raises questions about authorship and ownership. If an AI creates a work of art, who owns the copyright? Is it the creator of the AI algorithm or the person who owns the AI? These questions will become increasingly important as AI-generated art becomes more prevalent, and it's important for artists to advocate for their rights and ensure that they are properly credited and compensated for their work.Finally, as an artist, I am frustrated by the idea that AI can replace the human element of art. Art is more than just a technical skill, it's about emotion, passion, and connection. While AI can certainly produce impressive works, it lacks the ability to connect with audiences on a deeper level. It's important for artists to continue to push the boundaries of their craft and to embrace the unique perspectives and experiences that only humans can provide.In conclusion, while I am excited about the potential of artificial intelligence in the art world, I believe that it's important to recognize and value the human element of art. As artists, we must continue to create works that reflect our unique perspectives and experiences, while also being aware of the potential biases and ethical concerns that come with AI-generated art. By embracing both human creativity and technological innovation, we can create a more vibrant and inclusive art world.",4 days ago,5,1 comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/11pf9op/as_an_artist_i_am_fascinated_by_the_potential_of/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Artificial Intelligence will be used against us</h1>",Feeling_Captain_1233,"There are few topics that interested me as much as Artificial Intelligence. I've been doing my own personal research and tests with it since 2011. Years ago I engineered a system with a personally modified backpropagation logic, in a mix of interconnected neural networks, in an attempt to make an algorithm play any game I threw at it. I was fascinated with the hope of ever achieving AGI - Artificial General Intelligence, which, in lay terms, is basically a master algorithm that can specialize in any task, similar to our human brains.I achieved some nice results in my endeavor, and little by little the AI was able to play a few simple and varied games, even though I didn't teach it strictly how to play any of them. Eventually, though, I realized I couldn't proceed with my research. The problem was physical. I didn't have enough resources, processing power and memory, to back it all up. The AI's dataset growth was exponential and very inefficient, so it ended up filling my disks to a halt. I'm sure I could have optimized the source code, but, still, there was nothing much to be done against computational limits for this scope of work.Eventually, I became aware of the AI efforts of big tech companies like Google. At the time I imagined that, even though the billions of dollars and enormous data centers at their disposal, they would still never be able to approach anything close to Strong AI due to the very expensive nature of the enterprise (even for them). However, I was certain something like GPT-3 would eventually come out, but I believed it would be like three hundred years in the future. I remember even prospecting how cool it would be to have an AI perform complex tasks exactly like GPT-3 and similar do today. Therefore, my prediction was wrong, and I totally underestimated the  unparalleled capability of language models when coupled with enormous datasets and big processing power.I'm still in shock that it happened in my lifetime. I'm using it daily, and the more I use the more I realize we have reached a stage unique in our History. I believe society hasn't yet understood the proportions of such a revolution, which is still incipient, but that will change everything. New language models are coming out, increasingly intelligent, so it seems that humanity has opened a Pandora's Box, and there is no turning back. This progress happens adjacent to the development of robotics (Boston Dynamics, for instance), which just makes me suspect that we are much closer to Asimov's view than we assume.This being said, I'm pretty sure AI will be used against us, simply because it already is. Just see how big techs control us by playing with our dopamine pathways. Scrolling addiction, porn, consumerism, and so on, all happening because intelligent systems fit us into patterns they know without our very knowledge. Imagine, then, this but ten times more intelligent? One hundred times? One thousand times? One million? One billion? What could governments do with such technology as to enslave us even more?And this is just the very beginning.Armies of robots that don't falter in their loyalty. Unemployment. The destruction of many industries and jobs. We may be at the start point of true dystopia, a world in which just a few may rule over billions in unprecedented proportions. And these few may not even be humans.Don't get me wrong. I still find the subject fascinating, and perhaps AI may happen to be something positive. Yet, I don't know. I'm very distrustful. Once this thing reaches superhuman levels of intelligence, humanity will be dealing with a true Ghost in the Shell. I don't think we are already there, but, once we reach this stage, it may be over for humanity's delusions of superiority. We would be completely at the mercy of this newly found god. Whether it will decide to help us or condemn us, there will be nothing much to do.",5 days ago,17,15 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/areweinhell/comments/11o9j4x/artificial_intelligence_will_be_used_against_us/

Some people may question the acceptability of adults collecting these cards, but in reality, there are many reasons why it is a perfectly acceptable hobby for people of all ages.Firstly, collecting Pokémon cards can provide a sense of joy and excitement for people who have fond memories of the franchise from their childhood. Many adults who collect these cards do so for the nostalgia factor, and there's nothing wrong with reliving happy memories from the past.Secondly, collecting Pokémon cards can be a fun and rewarding hobby in its own right. The cards themselves are beautifully designed and intricately detailed, and the thrill of completing a set or finding a rare card can be incredibly satisfying. Plus, the trading and social aspects of the hobby can provide opportunities for people to connect and bond over a shared interest.Thirdly, collecting Pokémon cards can have a financial aspect to it as well. While not all cards will appreciate in value, some rare or highly sought-after cards can be worth a significant amount of money. For some collectors, the potential for financial gain adds another layer of excitement and motivation to their hobby.Lastly, collecting Pokémon cards is no different from collecting any other type of item, such as stamps, coins, or art. Just because it's associated with a children's franchise doesn't mean it's any less valid as a hobby for adults. In fact, many hobbies that were once considered ""childish"" have become more widely accepted as adult hobbies in recent years, such as comic book collecting or playing video games.In conclusion, there are many reasons why collecting Pokémon cards as an adult is perfectly acceptable. It can bring joy, provide a fun and rewarding hobby, offer financial potential, and is no different from collecting any other item of interest. As long as it brings happiness and fulfillment to the individual, there is no reason why anyone should feel ashamed or embarrassed for collecting Pokémon cards.",5 days ago,0,20 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11od4p2/a_onepage_essay_on_why_collecting_pokémon_cards/

Some of the ways in which AI can help with cognitive recovery are:Personalized treatment plans: AI can be used to develop personalized treatment plans based on an individual's unique needs, strengths, and weaknesses. By analyzing large amounts of data and using machine learning algorithms, AI can identify patterns and insights that can be used to create targeted interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of the individual.Cognitive assessments: AI can be used to assess an individual's cognitive abilities and identify areas of weakness or decline. This can be done through various methods, including cognitive tests and assessments, speech and language analysis, and imaging techniques.Cognitive training: AI can be used to develop cognitive training programs that target specific cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and executive function. These programs can be tailored to the individual's specific needs and can be adjusted based on their progress.Virtual reality therapy: AI-powered virtual reality therapy can be used to create immersive and interactive environments that can help individuals with cognitive impairments to relearn skills and practice new behaviors in a safe and controlled environment.",6 days ago,1,0 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePinayCringeCrisis/comments/11nrv9d/artificial_intelligence_is_awesome/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc., $AITX Today announced the successful deployment of multiple ROSA security robots.</h1>",StocksonHighAlertz,"Detroit, Michigan, March 10, 2023 — Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc., (the “Company”) (OTCPK:AITX), a global leader in AI-driven security and productivity solutions for enterprise clients along with its wholly owned subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), today announced the successful deployment of multiple ROSA security robots. The end-user for this deployment is a large regional hospital group that is part of a health group with over 600 locations. This order was facilitated through one of the Company’s largest dealers.Eight ROSA units comprising this phase of the deployment have been configured as dual-unit ROSA-P devices in addition to one standard ROSA. ROSA-P is one of the recent additions to the ROSA lineup that uses existing light poles as its primary power source whether or not the light is centrally controlled.The critical feature of this deployment is the inclusion of the RAD Light My Way platform. This unique patent-pending solution was the basis for the client’s purchase decision. Parking lots are the third most common place for assaults, abductions, and homicides, according to recent FBI data. A survey by the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety group found that nearly 70% of armed robberies and 56% of rape incidents of health care workers occurred in parking and adjacent areas.“This is by far the most meaningful and personally satisfying of our hundreds of deployments,” said Steve Reinharz, CEO of AITX and RAD. “While speaking with administrators at another healthcare facility years ago the idea for RAD Light My Way was born. The nursing staff at that facility expressed their unease about walking alone to and from their cars during night shifts. This deployment is evidence that the idea had merit, and can provide much needed peace of mind, while improving security for these essential workers.”Reinharz added, “I have never seen security and facility professionals this excited, and so grateful for a solution to their problems. Soon thousands of the hospital’s staff will be enrolled in RAD Light My Way, making this RAD’s largest deployment to date.”ROSA is a multiple award-winning, compact, self-contained, portable, security and communication solution that can be deployed in about 15 minutes. Like other RAD solutions, it only requires power as it includes all necessary communications hardware. ROSA’s AI-driven security analytics include human, firearm, vehicle detection, license plate recognition, responsive digital signage and audio messaging, and complete integration with RAD’s software suite notification and autonomous response library. Two-way communication is optimized for cellular, including live video from ROSA’s dual high-resolution, full-color, always-on cameras. RAD has published three Case Studies detailing how ROSA has helped eliminate instances of theft, trespassing and loitering at car rental locations and construction sites across the country.RAD Light My Way has been named the recipient of two Secure Campus 2022 Awards from Campus Security & Life Safety Magazine. In October 2021 RAD Light My Way along with RAD’s ROSA won CBRE’s 2021 Best Workplace Experience Solution Award.AITX through its subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), is redefining the $25 billion (US) security and guarding services industry through its broad lineup of innovative, AI-driven Solutions-as-a-Service business model. RAD solutions are specifically designed to provide a cost savings to businesses of between 35%-80% when compared to the industry’s existing and costly manned security guarding and monitoring model. RAD delivers this tremendous costs savings via a suite of stationary and mobile robotic solutions that complement, and at times, directly replace the need for human personnel in environments better suited for machines. All RAD technologies, AI-based analytics and software platforms are developed in-house. RAD has a prospective sales pipeline of over 35 Fortune 500 companies and numerous other client opportunities. RAD expects to continue to attract new business as it converts its existing sales opportunities into deployed clients generating a recurring revenue stream.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Artificial Intelligence's Debt Overview BY Benzinga — 8:00 AM ET 03/09/2023</h1>",No-Replacement-7475,"Shares of Artificial Intelligence Inc. (OTC:AITX) moved lower by 4.00% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Artificial Intelligence has.ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEBTAccording to the Artificial Intelligence's most recent balance sheet as reported on January 20, 2023, total debt is at $33.12 million, with $31.03 million in long-term debt and $2.09 million in current debt. Adjusting for $713 thousand in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $32.41 million.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Artificial Intelligence's $6.12 million in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 5.41. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.Full story here: https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/03/31275146/artificial-intelligences-debt-overviewP.S..
