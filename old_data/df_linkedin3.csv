Alexander Smazhuk,0,,,"Artificial intelligence, ChatGPT... Could it be a revolution in marketing?It's not a new Google algorithm or a social media add and not even a usual chatbot. Be sure with ChatGPT and the same technologies we are already at the start of a new digital era.According to OpenAI ChatGPT uses ""reinforced learning with human feedback"" (RLHF) ‚Äî which is what makes it sound so real. And that's why it could replace some marketing specialists.What tasks could the business solve with ChatGPT?Customer supportOne of the biggest advantages of ChatGPT is its ability to provide personalized customer experiences. By using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, ChatGPT can understand the nuances of human language and respond to customer queries in real time. This means that businesses can use ChatGPT to provide personalized responses to customers based on their specific needs, preferences, and interests. For example, if a customer is looking for a specific product or service, ChatGPT can provide relevant recommendations based on their search history and purchase behavior.Analytics and researchesAnother way ChatGPT can change the future of marketing is by providing businesses with valuable insights into customer behavior. By analyzing customer interactions with ChatGPT, businesses can gain insights into customer preferences, needs, and pain points. This information can be used to improve product development, customer service, and marketing strategies. For example, if customers are frequently asking for a specific feature or product, businesses can use this information to develop new products or improve existing ones.LidgenerationChatGPT can also help businesses to automate lead generation. It could be used to qualify leads and schedule appointments with potential customers. So it could free up sales teams to focus on closing deals.Content creationWith the help of ChatGPT, you could create a general content plan, ideas for content lines, and single everyday posts.By automating only these tasks, businesses can save time and resources, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their business.Wright down in comments what other marketing tasks and functions can ChatGPT perform for the business.P.S. On the other side, AI still could not change the human mind in the processes of strategy creation. So if you need to form the vision for your business, define global and short-term goals, create a comprehensive promotion strategy, or determine the methods of its implementation, then write your questions to me in personal messages!#marketing#business#sales#digital#ai#artificialintelligence#machinelearning#google#content#customerservice#analytics#algorithms#marketingconsultant#businesscoach",1 minute ago

Dr. Dimitrios Geromichalos,4,,1 repost,"""Talking About Large Language Models""Dank der rasanten Fortschritte im Bereich der k√ºnstlichen Intelligenz sind wir in eine √Ñra eingetreten, in der sich Technologie und Philosophie auf interessante Weise √ºberschneiden. Im Zentrum dieser √úberschneidung stehen gro√üe Sprachmodelle (Large Language Models, LLMs). Je besser LLMs die menschliche Sprache nachahmen, desto anf√§lliger werden wir f√ºr Anthropomorphismus, d. h. daf√ºr, die Systeme, in die sie eingebettet sind, als menschen√§hnlicher zu betrachten, als sie tats√§chlich sind. Dieser Trend wird durch die nat√ºrliche Tendenz verst√§rkt, philosophisch aufgeladene Begriffe wie ""wei√ü"", ""glaubt"" und ""denkt"" zu verwenden, wenn diese Systeme beschrieben werden. Um diese Tendenz abzuschw√§chen, pl√§diert dieses Papier daf√ºr, immer wieder einen Schritt zur√ºckzutreten, um uns daran zu erinnern, wie LLMs und die Systeme, zu denen sie geh√∂ren, tats√§chlich funktionieren. Die Hoffnung ist, dass eine gr√∂√üere wissenschaftliche Pr√§zision zu mehr philosophischer Nuancierung im Diskurs √ºber k√ºnstliche Intelligenz f√ºhren wird, sowohl innerhalb des Fachgebiets als auch im √∂ffentlichen Bereich.https://lnkd.in/e67sR5rm#LLM#LLMs#MLLM#AI#KI#artificialintelligence#K√ºnstlicheintelligenz#gpt4#chatgpt",

Jessica Smith,0,,,"The current use of Artificial Intelligence in service and support is far from satisfactory. Despite the grand promises of self-managing bots, auto-correcting issues, and proactively resolving problems - the apex of customer service - these have unfortunately been left unfulfilled.With the release of new products and services, it is evident that AI has become an integral part of Business. IT support is one area where AI can be of great assistance. The primary objectives of IT support are to identify and resolve technical issues efficiently. AI can help reduce the number of issues that need human intervention by automating simple tasks such as password reset and providing recommendations for known solutions. Additionally, AI can also be used to generate reports on trends and usage patterns which can help identify potential areas of improvement.While the use of AI in IT support is still in its infancy, it is evident that there is great potential for it to automate routine tasks and improve efficiency. In the future, we can expect AI to play a more proactive role in identifying and resolving problems before they cause major disruptions.#business#ai#future#artificialintelligence#customerservice#help",3 minutes ago

Jeff Nalin,0,,,"Why transition towards 5G might be a good idea ‚Äì right now?Safe cities continue to be a hot topic. Cities are facing a number of new security challenges. These include organized crime, climate change and geopolitical threats. They must also deal with restricted budgets. To meet these challenges, critical organizations need new and more efficient ways of working. Overall, they must be able to do more with less. But how can they do this?Critical communications users are increasingly using mobile broadband to meet these challenges.Several public safety organizations are already using Agnet or are bringing it into use, such as in RRF (R√©seau Radio du Futur ‚Äì France‚Äôs pioneering case for security and emergency rescue forces) and¬†Virve 2 (Finland‚Äôs new generation public safety network) projects. These projects will provide 4G/LTE broadband services, which will work seamlessly with existing narrowband services during the migration period.4G/LTE already offers a good way to extend their current applications to broadband networks, as well as to adopt new broadband apps. 5G will further enable new and significantly better ways for public safety and other professional organizations to manage incidents and emergencies. It can even help find new ways to prevent them.5G ‚Äì a wealth of new opportunitiesCities are becoming ever more connected, integrated and digitalized. 5G technology plays a key role in this.

Mikhail Sharovatov,0,,,"Now is a great time to use AI for tasks in project management. I've found that AI-powered tools can help streamline work and make better decisions.Resource allocation: AI-based tools can help you optimize your team's schedule and balance workloads to ensure that you make the most of your resources. As an example - Forecast.Task Management: Asana uses artificial intelligence to help prioritize tasks and assign team members to jobs that match their skills. With the help of artificial intelligence, you can easily see which tasks require attention and quickly assign them to the right people.Risk Management: Artificial intelligence-based tools, such as Zenseact, help identify potential risks and provide suggestions on how to reduce them. This helps to avoid potential problems and move the project forward.Reporting and Analytics: AI-based analytical tools such as Databox provide valuable information about project performance, allowing data-based decisions to be made about progress toward goals, budget compliance, and resource utilization.Using artificial intelligence for project management tasks saves time and helps to make more effective decisions. As a project manager, it's important to keep up with the latest technology and take advantage of tools that can help us work smarter, not harder.#AIforBusiness#ProjectManagement#BusinessAutomation#ITProjectManagement#Efficiency",11 minutes ago

That's right, artificial intelligence (AI) is coming to these two popular tools, and it's set to revolutionize the way content writers work.With the new AI capabilities, Google Docs will be able to analyze your writing and suggest changes in real-time. This means that you'll no longer need to spend hours sifting through your work for errors or trying to come up with better word choices. Instead, you can focus on the more creative aspects of writing, knowing that your AI co-writer has got your back.But that's not all. The integration of AI in Gmail means that you'll be able to compose emails faster than ever before.The platform will be able to suggest complete sentences and even entire paragraphs based on the content of your email.So, if you're struggling to find the right words to express your thoughts, Google's AI will be there to help you out.Of course, some content writers might be skeptical about the impact of AI on their profession. After all, writing is a highly creative and personal endeavor, and some might worry that an AI co-writer could detract from their unique voice.But, in reality, AI is simply a tool that can help you achieve your writing goals more efficiently. With the time and energy saved by the AI, you'll have more space to focus on the aspects of writing that require a human touch.So, what does this all mean for content writers? Well, it means that the future of writing is here, and it's looking brighter than ever.With the integration of AI into Docs and Gmail, content writers can now produce high-quality content more efficiently than ever before.So, let's embrace this new technology and see where it takes us. The possibilities are endless!#Bhavyawrites#ai#artificialintelligence#content#contentwriting#contentwriter#googlenews#google#linkedinpost#linkedin#linkedincommunity",15 minutes ago

Harpreet Gill,2,,,"Exciting new developments are taking place in the Tech/IT industry across Europe, and it's an exciting time to be a part of this dynamic sector. From new technologies and innovative start-ups to major investments in research and development, Europe is quickly becoming a global hub for Tech/IT innovation.One area where we're seeing rapid progress is in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In countries like Germany, France, and the UK, AI is being used to transform industries ranging from healthcare to finance. Startups like Paris-based Snips are working on cutting-edge natural language processing technology, while German firms like Celonis and Flixbus are leveraging AI to improve their business processes.Another exciting development is the growth of fintech start-ups across Europe. Companies like Revolut, N26, and Transferwise are challenging traditional banking models and making it easier than ever for consumers to manage their finances. Meanwhile, established banks are investing in digital transformation initiatives to remain competitive in an increasingly crowded market.Beyond these specific areas, Europe is also home to many innovative startups and established tech giants like Spotify, Adyen, and Zalando. These companies are constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the tech world, and they're attracting top talent from around the globe.Of course, Europe faces its share of challenges, including regulatory hurdles and a shortage of skilled workers.But with initiatives like the European Commission's Digital Single Market and the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, the region is working to overcome these obstacles and continue its ascent as a global tech powerhouse.Overall, there's never been a more exciting time to be a part of the Tech/IT industry in Europe. As new developments continue to emerge and the pace of innovation accelerates, we can expect to see even more exciting breakthroughs in the years to come.If you are finding yourself wanting to explore the Tech/IT market in the European space, feel free to simply send me a message so we here at Venquis can provide you with opportunities relevant to you.#technology#ai#digital#innovation#growth#tech#development#business#digitaltransformation#artificialintelligence#research",17 minutes ago

DHRUV PODDAR,0,,,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and HOW THE FUTURE FOR ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE LOOKS LIKE?If you are unaware, recently, on January 5th, Amazon confirmed that it laid off 18,000 of its employees. Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company laid off 12,000 people. Meta laid off 11,000 and Twitter laid off 4,000. Even Microsoft and Salesforce declared 10,000 and 8,000 people redundant.Amongst a variety of reasons, reasons like over hiring, uncertain global macroeconomic conditions and strong tailwinds from the covid-19 pandemic came up. But it cannot be so simple, right?All the big tech giants, declaring redundancy and firing people, all at the same time. It cannot be so simple, in black and white, right?Well, the answer is simple, it is just the start of Artificial Intelligence taking over the world, and companies like Alphabet, Amazon and Meta have had the advantage of exercising the immense potential and power of the same, but at the same time creating a catastrophe.It might make us wonder, even scared, when we look at how the future might shape, in our fields of Primary Interests, that is Accounting and Finance, where tasks are quite repetitive in nature, especially if we look at Accounting, specifically.One thing is for sure, that roles of finance and accounts professionals will be fast changing. Will they run out of jobs? Well, we don‚Äôt know about that. But, if there is something that you do, that a machine can also do, then a machine will always be preferred. One, because machines are more accurate, and two, most importantly, machine costs are quite inexpensive as compared to skilled human labor costs. So you will run out of your job if you are not bringing anything new to the table.That being said, here is the analogy we like to use. Do you remember back in the day, when the computer was first used to maintain books and for bookkeeping? Despite all the narratives that were going around at that moment, we eventually did shift to a complete system of maintaining books on accounting soft wares and not on paper based, manual accounting system. Well, did that mean that the computer barred the need for accounting, or did that mean that the computer took away jobs? The way I see it, neither. It just created a more advanced and sophisticated system for accurate, confirmatory and predictive bookkeeping, accounting, auditing, and assurance, for the greater good, of course. But yes, people who did not know how to use a computer, or did not learn the skills, or keep up with the same, did lose out. We believe, years later, now, Artificial Intelligence is going to do the same.‚ÄúChange is the only constant in one‚Äôs life, and one‚Äôs ability to adapt to such changes is what would determine the success in their lives‚ÄùLawSikhoSachin Kumar#accounting#finance#jobs#success#people#artificialintelligence#future#change#power",20 minutes ago

Amirhossein Tohidi,0,,,"Machine learning methods are based on the idea that systems can learn from data and recognize patterns with minimal human intervention. Although machine learning methods provide accurate results for marketing decisions, the use of these methods in marketing studies is still at an early stage. Also, the ability of machine learning methods to consider heterogeneity among consumers has not been proven.Artificial neural networks are able to measure all nonlinear and complex interactions between the variables of the system, unlike discrete choice random utility models. There is no need to specify a mathematical relationship between the input and output variables. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks are known as black-box models, and the lack of interpretability is their weakness.In an article published in the British Food Journal entitled ""Organic food market segmentation based on the neobehavioristic theory of consumer behavior,"" I used four fuzzy and crisp clustering algorithms to segment the organic food market. By performing a sensitivity analysis on the output of the artificial neural network, I analyzed how the explanatory variables influence purchase intentions.We used two other machine learning methods to extract consumer behavior rules in our latest study, which is now ready for submission. From a policy perspective, the results obtained are very interesting and meaningful.Using a distributed artificial intelligence model, our next goal will be to simulate the behavior of artificial agents/consumers.#machinelearning#marketing#consumerbehavior",35 minutes ago

Rohan Korde,0,,,"An asymptotic attempt at answering the biggest question going around...The#chatgpt'movement' has created two sets of opinions. One set cannot wait for it to mimic humanity. The other set is looking to find failure- hack it. Anyhow.The existential question on whether AI could, at a point on the time horizon, replace the day-to-day faculties of the human brain is not a simplistic binary call; it is instead a probability that could perhaps be informed by the#reverse#fibonaccisequenceequation.An illustration of this probability could be a collapsing triad/triangle of intelligence, intellect and wisdom on a Fibonacci spiral with consciousness as the center or origin. Let us assume that intelligence follows intellect follows wisdom follows consciousness (in that order). This is a value chain that ultimately drives consciousness.For definition,#intelligencecan be described as gathered information,#intellectcan be defined as a series of reasoning hypothesis built on top of intelligence. Wisdom on the other hand can be understood as the ability of understand human nature. Human nature can be paradoxical, counterintuitive, counterculture, contradictory or also be conventional), an intersection of the rational and emotional!Thus, while intelligence, at the bottom of the value chain is a machine at work, consciousness is the apex, the stargate to enlightenment.Will AI replace humans?I could choose the reverse fibonacci sequence principle as a safe bet to guesstimate the answer as human brain development follows the fibonacci sequence, growing at a rate dictated by the golden ratio. For AI, therefore, to close the gap between itself and the human brain, the intelligence bubble (illustration attached to this post) has to accelerate on the spiral (shown by the arc) and merge with the intellect bubble, which in turn is also accelerating towards the wisdom bubble. All 3 bubbles then have to eventually collapse into the consciousness core. At least that is how the equation is supposed to play out.At 100 trillion parameters, Chatgpt-4 matches the human brain. But that is capacity. When the chatgpt algorithm runs, 'artificial intellect' is activated, which is pretty much the output we are all getting at the moment from GPT-3 right now, making us go weak in our knees.This is where it gets really, really tough for AI. GPT-X (will call it X as X can hold multiple values) now has to patternize human nature (if at all, with its irrational paradoxes - behavioral variance) in order to come frighteningly close to the human brain. What extent of computing capacity and additional parameters will that take to do is anyone's guess.

It comes with a tool called MakerSuite which lets you start prototyping quickly. We‚Äôre also bringing generative AI capabilities to#GoogleCloud customers through Vertex AI, and a new Generative AI App Builder to help organizations create chat interfaces and other applications.Google Workspaceis getting some new features, too. Trusted testers will soon be able to use AI in Gmail and Google Docs to make the writing process easier -- such as typing in a topic you‚Äôd like to write about and seeing a draft generated. You can learn more in this video:https://lnkd.in/daE4wX9eThere are many teams across Google which have been working hard to reach this moment -- and this is just the first step.

Rolf van Haren,1,,,"REDUCTIONISM FROM LANGUAGE WITH A TOUCH OF TECHNOLOGYA description leads to a fixed mindset. Or else: If we make a description of ourselves or someone else, it leads us to find it difficult to see beyond the words that are given. This is an aspect of our brain that I call a fixed mindset. To break free from this fixed mindset and to come to new perspectives, there is a lot available on the market: Design Thinking workshops, Lego serious play and many many other fun creative sessions, which make good money but don‚Äôt solve (sorry to say it) a thing on a fundamental level.What is fundamentally not addressed is the way we use words (also in these sessions). As a linguist, I learned how limiting words are, or how they contribute to unlocking potential. Our reality is locked up in words, in descriptions, in beliefs, in fixed mindsets.Living in a world where so much is done with language as with artificial intelligence, we have to think about what we want to be amplified by technology. What reality will technology mirror to us, where will we get stuck in? Even with functions that increase or decrease valuations in an algorithm, it still makes it polarize, non-diverse and non-inclusive. It reduces us to a set of words when we are more than those words. What should we leave to technology and what should we not want to extract?Reductionism is one of the curiosities created by our eternal drive for expansion. Somewhere a contradiction, but we have subjected our own expansion of consciousness and the discovery of new language and art to the expansion of a capitalistic system that does not care about us, the people. Reductionism pushes valuable information out the process and flattens the curve of liveliness. Technology is and will play an even greater role in this it will accelerate this phenomenon.As#theupgradesociety, we try to develop in this space of technology as well.

It has a longer memory. Up to 50 pages of text, in fact. So it can keep track of a conversation a whole story.-> Jump from 3,000 to 25,000 word limit.üëÖ 4. It's multilingual. GPT-4 can answer questions accurately in 26 different languages, a significant improvement from previous models.-> Can build sandcastles from text.-> Much faster and more advanced than the last GTP-3.5.The real world implementations of this for education, customer supports, content creation and more are MASSIVE!

Richard Georges,0,,,"ChatGPT-4 Is Here. Think Artificial Intelligence On Steroids.AS a subscriber to ChatGPT Plus, I am now rocking Version 4, which is far more comprehensive, intelligent and responsive that the previous version. Generative AI is becoming more ""human"" all the time. I am very excited about putting it through its paces. I also think that there are a lot of developers and companies trying to figure out how this new technology can power their software in the future. It is only a matter of time until AI is indistinguishable from the smartest human being on the planet. Of course, the systems will never be anything but human mimics that create human like conversations and information. The system will never convincingly duplicate human wit, poetic sensibility, and judgment. And, no, Virginia, Terminator robots will not walk the planet killing humans. At least, I don't think so. I could be wrong. Version 4 makes the same mistakes Version 3 made when I asked if it knew me. So, ChatGPT and other AI results will still have to be carefully edited by humans before being used. But, this thing can save hours and hours of human research and writing. Science fiction is becoming Science fact.",1 hour ago

The current process is imperfect. People have raised valid concerns about quality and bias in both design and impact - we share those concerns too.To improve the default behavior of our AI systems, we continue to prioritize efforts to address bias in how ChatGPT responds to prompts across a range of topics.

OpenAI,"8,093",248 comments,771 reposts,"Today we‚Äôre sharing more context about how ChatGPT‚Äôs behavior has been shaped to date, as well as the efforts we are undertaking to address concerns of bias in our AI systems.We breakdown the two main steps involved in building ChatGPT -pre-training and fine-tuning - and the role of OpenAI guidelines and human reviewers in shaping the system‚Äôs behavior. The current process is imperfect. People have raised valid concerns about quality and bias in both design and impact - we share those concerns too.To improve the default behavior of our AI systems, we continue to prioritize efforts to address bias in how ChatGPT responds to prompts across a range of topics. As part of this work, we‚Äôre exploring opportunities for the broader public to have a say in how these systems are designed. We are committed to this issue and will be transparent about our progress.Check out the full blog post for more information on OpenAI‚Äôs efforts to align AI systems with human values and ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity.https://lnkd.in/gMW4FKKBIf you are interested in doing research to help achieve this vision, including but not limited to research on fairness and representation, alignment, and sociotechnical research to understand the impact of AI on society, please apply for subsidized access to our API via the Researcher Access Program.https://lnkd.in/eDnHx5KbWe are also hiring for positions across Research, Alignment, Engineering, and more.https://lnkd.in/gGP5wrMp",
Rolf van Haren,1,,,"REDUCTIONISM FROM LANGUAGE WITH A TOUCH OF TECHNOLOGYA description leads to a fixed mindset. Or else: If we make a description of ourselves or someone else, it leads us to find it difficult to see beyond the words that are given. This is an aspect of our brain that I call a fixed mindset. To break free from this fixed mindset and to come to new perspectives, there is a lot available on the market: Design Thinking workshops, Lego serious play and many many other fun creative sessions, which make good money but don‚Äôt solve (sorry to say it) a thing on a fundamental level.What is fundamentally not addressed is the way we use words (also in these sessions). As a linguist, I learned how limiting words are, or how they contribute to unlocking potential. Our reality is locked up in words, in descriptions, in beliefs, in fixed mindsets.Living in a world where so much is done with language as with artificial intelligence, we have to think about what we want to be amplified by technology. What reality will technology mirror to us, where will we get stuck in? Even with functions that increase or decrease valuations in an algorithm, it still makes it polarize, non-diverse and non-inclusive. It reduces us to a set of words when we are more than those words. What should we leave to technology and what should we not want to extract?Reductionism is one of the curiosities created by our eternal drive for expansion. Somewhere a contradiction, but we have subjected our own expansion of consciousness and the discovery of new language and art to the expansion of a capitalistic system that does not care about us, the people. Reductionism pushes valuable information out the process and flattens the curve of liveliness. Technology is and will play an even greater role in this it will accelerate this phenomenon.As#theupgradesociety, we try to develop in this space of technology as well. Where we aim for awareness to increase and where capitalism knows its place, hand in hand with technology for a life of well-being.Well-Being in relationship with each other and the world around us.Are you with us?",59 minutes ago

deVere Group,2,1 comment,,"* population crisis in Japan *Japan is facing a population crisis due to its plummeting birth rate, prompting an adviser to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to warn that the country could ""disappear"" if the trend is not reversed. The decreasing birth rate is impacting the world's third-largest economy by putting strain on the labour market, reducing the number of consumers, and increasing demand for healthcare services. The situation also puts pressure on the government's finances and hampers long-term sustainable growth.However, technology and digitisation could play a crucial role in addressing Japan's population issues. Remote work, automation, health tech, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence can be leveraged to help mitigate the impact of the ageing population on the economy and society.Global investors who are serious about building wealth should consider this crisis as an opportunity, as the Japanese government is likely to adopt innovative solutions, making it easier to implement technology-driven approaches. While Japan's population crisis remains a serious issue, it is clear that tech can help provide solutions and present once-in-a-generation opportunities for investors.Speak with an investment advisor today to learn more about how to both protect and maximise the opportunities ahead.

Richard Georges,0,,,"ChatGPT-4 Is Here. Think Artificial Intelligence On Steroids.AS a subscriber to ChatGPT Plus, I am now rocking Version 4, which is far more comprehensive, intelligent and responsive that the previous version. Generative AI is becoming more ""human"" all the time. I am very excited about putting it through its paces. I also think that there are a lot of developers and companies trying to figure out how this new technology can power their software in the future. It is only a matter of time until AI is indistinguishable from the smartest human being on the planet. Of course, the systems will never be anything but human mimics that create human like conversations and information. The system will never convincingly duplicate human wit, poetic sensibility, and judgment. And, no, Virginia, Terminator robots will not walk the planet killing humans. At least, I don't think so. I could be wrong. Version 4 makes the same mistakes Version 3 made when I asked if it knew me. So, ChatGPT and other AI results will still have to be carefully edited by humans before being used. But, this thing can save hours and hours of human research and writing. Science fiction is becoming Science fact.",1 hour ago

Now users can modify and edit files using a Telegram bot. By describing clear tasks for editing a table with certain data, you can get a ready-made result even without knowing how to use Excel.You no longer have to look up formulas and remember how to apply them correctly. You just need to explain to the bot what exactly you want to do with a given data set.The bot will also help you build graphs and charts of any kind based on the information in the table.You can also edit image files. Just tell the bot what you want to do. The system will be able to crop, color, and convert your files to another format.#data#artificialintelligence#ai#aiproduct",1 hour ago

Timothy D. Otten,0,,,"The action and subsequent reactions to yesterday's alleged takedown of a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper by a Russian SU-27 is worth discussing. The takedown occurred over international waters and not over aNATOterritory; thus, steering clear of any Article 5 invocation (reference Article 6). Nevertheless, it does raise the question of whether or not this collision, intentional or unintentional, by a combat aircraft is to be considered an ""armed attack?"" That question matters; because if it is to be considered an ""armed attack"" and if the takedown happened in a NATO member's airspace, then this event would be much more diplomatically challenging with Article 5 potentially in play. But was it an ""armed attack?"" Does it matter that bullets or missiles were not used? Does it matter that the MQ-9 was remotely crewed (un-crewed) with no humans onboard?The latter question brings the work ofErik Lin-Greenbergof theMassachusetts Institute of Technologyand theU.S. Air Force Reserveto my mind.
