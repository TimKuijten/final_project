Fernando Araujo Filho,1,,,"What a day for the AI industry. The race is on! Yesterday, the same dayOpenAIannounced GPT 4,Googleannounced the new Google Workspace. If you miss that, don't worry, I will summarize everything in this post.#GPT4:This new update brings the technology to the next level. During the developer Demo yesterday,Greg Brockman, President and Co-founder ofOpenAI, showed some of the use cases that will be possible using GPT 4. That includes:- The model can learn a completely new language (for him) in few seconds, only by reading the entire documentation of it.- It can quickly debug issues.- Read and understand images- Convert images into scriptsAll of this at an extremely fast speed.#GoogleWorkspace (former G-Suite):According to the video shared by Google yesterday, with the help of their machine learning algorithm (LaMDA) users now will be able to interact with its assistant by asking for things such as:- Summarize long e-mail threads and help you reply to them.- Create documents based on e-mails with only a few commands- Build an entire presentation with AI-generated media- Take meeting notes- Personalize messages using google sheets commands.And much more.I can't believe that we are still in March, and since the launch of ChatGPT in November, the technology started to evolve so fast. Not even 5 months have been gone and so many new tools are available in the market thanks to AI and ML models.For those that want to watch the demo from OpenAI and Google Workspace video, I am adding them to the comments.#technology#machinelearning#ai",2 minutes ago
Code6,0,,,"Waze is making it easier for EV owners to find compatible charging points.Google-owned mapping app Waze is adding a new feature that seeks to help EV owners find a compatible charger en route. Users, once they have entered their vehicle model and plug type into the app, will be able to find the nearest EV charging stations, Waze said Tuesday.To avoid outdated and unreliable information about chargers, Waze said it is leveraging assistance from its community map editors. They will ensure that details about these stations are accurate and up to date.‚ÄúBy adding up-to-date EV charging information to the Waze map, it‚Äôs even easier to charge your car and get help finding where or when you‚Äôll come across the next station,‚Äù the company said in a blog post.‚ÄúThanks to local Map Editors from our Waze Community, EV data is reviewed and updated in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.‚ÄùWaze said that this new feature will be rolling out to users worldwide in the next few weeks. A report from Electrek, however, indicates that the EV Charger finding feature is currently not working as intended for some users ‚Äî showing them gas stations instead of chargers.Last year, Google updated the Maps app to let EV owners find a charger based on the plug type of their vehicle. Last month, the company went a step further and integrated features like Maps into some EVs from manufacturers such as Polestar, Volvo, General Motors and Renault. Over the last few years, the company has also expanded its feature to find eco-friendly routes for different vehicles.In December, the search giant combined Google Maps and Waze teams as a cost-cutting measure.Waze is making it easier for EV owners to find compatible charging points by Ivan Mehta originally published on TechCrunchhttps://lnkd.in/drJeKEpD",3 minutes ago

Jordan DSilva,0,,,"Virtual assistants can be a gamechanger if you know how to hire, train, and build the proper systems to maximize their abilities. Here are seven tips for utilizing virtual assistants.üîç Identify Your Needs: Before hiring a virtual assistant, it's important to identify your needs. Make a list of tasks that you would like your virtual assistant to handle, and don‚Äôt be afraid to think big. Think of all the tasks a remote worker can do for you and your business, make your wishlist and see what you can find.ü§ù Utilize Hiring Agencies and UpWork/Fiverr: Look for referrals for trusted virtual assistant hiring agencies and ones that specialize in finding people who can do the specific tasks that fit your needs. UpWork and Fiverr are also great resources, and it helps to have both types of channels available.üë§ Use Your Normal Hiring Process: It is important to remember you are bringing on a new team member and it takes effort to hire. Write out a clear description, responsibilities, qualifications, KPIs, and a hiring plan. Conduct interviews, send out assessments, and ensure candidates have aligned values with your company.üéì Create Training and Systems: Virtual assistants need the proper training to learn about your company, your needs, and your expectations. Invest in training with videos, templates, and guides. Build systems to delegate tasks and build processes for new hires to easily follow instructions. Even if your first hire doesn‚Äôt work out, you‚Äôll be ready to hire again.üîß Establish Key Tools: Use the same tools you use for the rest of your team whether that is Asana, G-Suite, Outlook, etc. Be aware of the other useful tools available to help. These may include remote access and VPN tools as well as calling software programs like Google Voice or Ring Central.üí¨ Provide Feedback: Providing feedback is essential to ensure your virtual assistant is meeting your expectations and thriving in their role. Provide regular feedback, both positive and constructive, acknowledge their contributions, and involve them in team functions.üìà Develop and Grow the Team: Don‚Äôt be afraid to grow the team and get out of your comfort zone. Add responsibilities and promote virtual assistants as they progress. If you can successfully grow your virtual assistant team you can increase your capacity and your time freedom.I want to hear from you, what are your virtual assistant needs, pain points, and aspirations?

He uses Google's hyper-aggressive over-reaction to the launch of Facebook (if you ever used Google+ you know) as a parallel to the current reaction to#chatgptOne particular feature it ""shows off"" in a video (link is in the article) is and AI Bot capturing notes for a Google Meet meeting. He talks about frustration with using Google Assistant, has he ever had to suffer thru even one attempt at dictating an email via Siri? I actually set up a shortcut on my iPhone so I could use Google Assistant over Siri...but I digress. Google is responding to being late to the party by flooding us with AI everything everywhere all at once (see what I did).Interesting to see what may be in store for those heavy Google users.",26 minutes ago

Nick Vince,1,,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing technology that can revolutionise the way your business operates. From automating daily tasks to providing customers with dynamic recommendations based on their data, AI provides the tools necessary to take your business to the next level. AI can also be used to improve customer experience and satisfaction by anticipating customer needs and responding quickly and accurately to customer queries.However, there is still a lot of confusion about the overall role of AI. One area that is considered problematic is that of AI-generated content. Using AI to write content for your website or the web is often frowned upon. Businesses are unsure about the ways it can be used.Danny Sullivan and Chris Nelson of Google‚Äôs Search Quality team clarified Google‚Äôs position on using AI-generated content in a recent blog post. They commented that it doesn‚Äôt matter how you create content, just as long as it is helpful to the user and follows Google‚Äôs E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) guidance.What is not tolerated is the use of AI to raise the position or status of a business by influencing search rankings to its advantage, something that Google has strict policies on. What we do know is that AI is here to stay and if used correctly, it can assist your business and customers very richly with its rewards.If you're interested in developing well-optimised quality content for your website then we'd love to hear from you.‚òé ¬†0777 172 3144üìßinfo@unityseo.co.uk#seooptimisation#seooptimization#smallbusinesssupportuk#seokeywords#smallbusinessnorfolk#smallbusinessnorwich#newbusiness#artificialintelligence#chatgpt#business#ai",55 minutes ago

Let√≠cia Tainara Souza,5,3 comments,,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, hist√≥rico de tend√™ncias e evolu√ß√µes, aqui v√£o algumas das tend√™ncias de marketing para 2023:ü§≥üèª Marketing de influ√™ncia: o marketing de influ√™ncia chegou pra ficar e continuar√° a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conte√∫do para alcan√ßar p√∫blicos espec√≠ficos (√ì a base da Virginia a√≠, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).üéÅ Personaliza√ß√£o: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experi√™ncia personalizada e relevante, e as empresas est√£o investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estrat√©gias para atender a essa demanda.üìº V√≠deo marketing: o v√≠deo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produ√ß√£o de v√≠deo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Ent√£o investe nisso. A era dos est√°ticos morreu).üîä Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas est√£o come√ßando a adotar estrat√©gias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personaliza√ß√£o tamb√©m).üì© Marketing de conte√∫do: este continuar√° a desempenhando um papel importante na constru√ß√£o de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisar√£o investir em conte√∫do de alta qualidade e em estrat√©gias de distribui√ß√£o para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.üéØ Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experi√™ncia perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estrat√©gias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor est√° em todos os canais e √© inteligente pensar em estrat√©gias adaptadas em cada um deles.üé≤ Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas est√£o cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estrat√©gias de an√°lise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).ü§ñB√îNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estrat√©gias e materiais publicit√°rios tamb√©m √© algo que n√£o tem volta - e que bom! Se voc√™ √© um profissional da √°rea, sugiro come√ßar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estrat√©gias e tomadas de decis√£o. Pois como diz a famosa m√∫sica de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por a√≠, ""hoje √© um novo dia, de um novo tempo que come√ßou. Todos os nossos sonhos, ser√£o verdade e o futuro j√° come√ßou"".#marketing#tecnologia#amazon#empresas#salesforce#marketingsensorial#marketing2023#marketingderelacionamento",1 hour ago

Kornel Grunwald,2,1 comment,,"That is an interesting one: 'In an interview with the Financial Times, Microsoft‚Äôs CEO Satya Nadella labelled the first generation of voice assistants ‚Äúdumb as a rock‚Äù, including Cortana and Siri from Apple and Alexa and Google Assistant from Google. When asked about voice assistants in 2016, Nadella reportedly said ‚ÄúBots are the new apps‚Äù.'I can follow the logic that the promise of voice bots fell short of expectations and how GPT-related innovation is finally realizing a portion of that potential. But the big gap is still missing. And it was not about 'dumbness' that made bots really annoying.A few years ago, voicebots took centre stage with the promise of revolutionizing customer service and user experience. However, their limited understanding of natural language, context, and complexity made them less effective than anticipated. Users often found themselves frustrated with their interactions, leading to a decline in their adoption. I have heard also how difficult it was for these companies to deal with local dialects and small language fluctuations, and do the proper job to annotate datasets with such voice samples.Then GPT enters the stage. Here are two of the ways in which GPT-powered solutions have outshined voicebots:1. Enhanced natural language understanding: GPT-based models can comprehend context and nuance.2. High-quality generation: GPT-powered AI can create human-like responses.Voicebots may not have lived up to their initial hype, but GPT-related innovation has stepped in to fill that void. But does it really?We still are to see a proper missing link to be provided by new innovation: understanding of our voices.How do understand the human voice, if we just continue to speak as we do - I am not sure if you realize how unusual our patterns of speaking are. But beyond that, how tech can listen to those who struggle with some voice-related disabilities or impairments? Or how to get around the 'weirdness' of non-native speakers being fluent in the new language?These are, by far, not trivial or simple tasks, and as much as I can see the GPT revolution giving us better chances at providing great experience once voice is transcribed into text, it is still far from breaking that frontier and making our voice the main interface with technology.But considering the fact that I personally know a couple of specialists in ML/AI looking into this specific problem, I bet we are in for something big soon.Interesting times.#voice#ai",1 hour ago

Bhavika Mundra,2,1 comment,,"Wait!!!Is your blogs not getting enough views?Most of the time bloggers complain that they are not getting views. The audience is not engaging with their content.It might be due to 3 reasons.1. Not creating content for your target audience.It is the most common mistake new bloggers did. They generally create content that excites them. They forget about their audience.Solution: Research your target audience before you start writing blogs. Then head on to writing blogs keeping the likes and dislikes of your audience in mind.2. Not structuring your blogs.Another major problem is not structuring the blogs properly.Solution: Design your blog posts properly. Organize your blogs properly by creating an outline. I have made a post regarding the ideal blog outline that helped me to rank on first page of Google. The link to that is in the comments. Make sure to check it out.3. Your blog is not SEO optimized.SEO is an important factor for ranking on Google. You are getting lesser views because your blog is not SEO optimized.Solution: Follow SEO guidelines.

Michaela Browning,16,1 comment,1 repost,"Google‚Äôs advanced work in AI and the ability of this technology to make an impact was one of the main motivators for me to join the company. And yesterday, our teams announced new ways that Google Cloud will make generative AI more accessible for developers, businesses, and governments.One example: Generative AI App Builder will give developers what they need to take advantage of machine learning models from Google and quickly build next generation apps such as digital assistants, custom search engines, and chat apps -- with limited technical expertise required. This is a powerful tool for building citizen services and understanding large, internal datasets.Underlying this is Google‚Äôs responsible approach to AI. Private data is kept private and organisations control where data is stored and how or if it is used. And it‚Äôs also why we‚Äôre launching these new AI experiences via a trusted tester program first, iterating and refining them.#generativeai#responsibleai",1 hour ago

Donnacha Kirk,13,3 comments,3 reposts,"@OpenAI launched#GPT4, its newest and most advanced Large Language Model (LLM), yesterday to great fanfare.The launch demo had great fun showing off the ""creativity"" of the model (your mileage may vary when anthropomorphising auto-complete on steroids). I was genuinely tickled when GPT4 managed to summarise a long OpenAI blogpost (about itself, of course) into a sentence using only words beginning with the letter Q:""GPT-4 quintessentially quickens quality quantifications, quelling questionable quandaries""By far the biggest departure from previous versions is that GPT4 is no longer just a large *language* model - it can readily handle a mixed input of text and images (LL&IM?). The demo included GPT4 describing images in detail, answering questions about images and even composing the html for a website based on a hand-drawn mock-up.What seemed clear is that OpenAI's efforts remain focused on producing fast, fluent and effective outputs but not necessarily highly accurate ones. There was no attempt to quiz the model on factual questions of the kind that humbled @Google's Bard AI last month.The reality that GPT4 and similar models often produce ""close but not quite right"" outputs is not a problem in itself but it does mean that organisations trying to incorporate LLMs into their toolkits need to find new ways of working.To me, the most powerful applications right now are those where LLMs are deployed as assistants or co-pilots, boosting the productivity of highly skilled and creative humans. Think of them like Ripley's powered exoskeleton from Aliens - a machine that lets you do much more, much faster but with the human firmly in control.This approach is most advanced in the writing of code but GPT4's native incorporation of images widens the horizon - for example image and video creators can now generate descriptive text for accessibility in a fraction of the time or a photo of a sketched architecture on a whiteboard could be turned into pseudo-code in seconds.For now the limit is our imagination. Soon, no doubt the most effective uses will spread like wildfire and become table stakes, especially if the cost equilibrium remains around the current level where GPT and other language models produce output at a fraction of the cost of a human expert.The immediate challenge for organisations is: who can react most quickly? Changing our ways of working is not easy, particularly when it means your most skilled and productive workers need to spend time learning a new approach to their most fundamental tasks. The prize is a level of productivity far beyond your rivals, at least for now.#ai#gpt4#llms#openai#CISO#cybersecurity#humanriskmanagement",2 hours ago

Kris Laermans,10,1 comment,,"Hey there! Did you hear the news? GPT4 has just been released! It's an evolution of ChatGPT based on GPT3.5, which you may already know. But this new version is even better. It allows you to be more demanding with the constraints of your questions. For instance, you can ask for each word of the answer to begin with a specific letter or tailor the answer to a targeted audience. Plus, it can take into account important content like documents of several dozen pages and answer specific questions or even make calculations based on the rules of the document.Advantage of the technologyBut wait, what is generative AI, you might ask? Well, it won't make you an expert in any domain, but it can help you become more creative by generating unique content such as music, art, and text that you may not have thought of otherwise. This can lead to new and innovative ideas and products. Plus, it can help you be more efficient by analyzing vast amounts of data and generating insights and predictions quickly, saving you time and reducing costs.Risks of not using itHowever, not using this technology today only limits the productivity potential of your company. It's like having a below-average assistant working for you for free. And who knows what the future holds? The skills of these AIs may grow to something we can't even imagine.Use casesSo, what are some use cases for Elia Group? Well, like any other company, generative AI can be used to help with writing articles, emails, and document research. But with the possibility to inject more content and provide more constraints in the questions, it could open doors to use cases such as engineering calculations based on internal documents by asking to explain each step to be checked afterward by an expert.Who is working on it?Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and many startups are all diving into this exciting technology.Do you have any ideas for using generative AI?

(boy did I save them... üòÖ)I set out to Google and taught myself to program on Excel and basically wrote the equivalent of SAP's stock management ON EXCEL!During COVID I started my business to help my customers become more productive by automating Excel for them. One of my customers can now do in 10 minutes what used to take her LITERALLY the whole WEEK! ü§ØShe's excited to go to work now! I brought passion back in the workplace!My boss at the company I worked for's daughters need a job due to COVID and I trained them to take over from me over the next few months.I had a relatively steady income, but now I am on my own and really need customers.I have so much to give my customers, but I actually never talk about myself like this and promote my business (it really feels like I'm bragging, or people think it sounds too good to be true...)Why am I telling you this?  (Let's get back to the point right üòÖ)I am busy writing that Excel based Stock Management System again!And this time, it will have QA management systems in, which no current system on the market even has!Sounds amazing right?

Holly Schmidt,34,8 comments,,"Little late to the game here, but it has been a crazy past couple of weeks! On February 28th I packed up my things and moved to FRANKFURT, Germany! And then one day later on March 1st, I officially started atDeutsche Bahnas an Executive Assistant to the Head of Purchasing for Locomotives and Wagons, Rentals (officially Assistenz des Leiters Einkauf Loks und Wagen, Anmietungen) ‚Äì complete with a supplier meeting on my very first day in Mainz of all places! Life moves FAST y‚Äôall!How did I get here? Late last year, I accepted a job with Deutsche Bahn ‚Äì but couldn‚Äôt officially start due to some visa issues. Before I could get the paperwork in order to change jobs, I was subsequently let go fromWayfairBerlin on January 20th, 2023 ‚Äì along with many other VERY talented and motivated colleagues at Wayfair. Ironically, January 20th, 2023 also marked my 3 year anniversary at Wayfair ‚Äì very symbolic in a sense as I can now say that I worked at Wayfair for EXACTLY 3 years :) Soon after that, I was able to get the paperwork I needed to officially changed jobs. What followed was a lovely 5 week break that allowed me to reset, recharge and prepare to move to Frankfurt and start a new career!I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for the time I spent at Wayfair. Maybe I‚Äôm biased, but I do really do believe that my Plumbing, Hardware and Renovation suppliers are some of the BEST! From various Google Meets, phone calls and in-person meetings at the KBB Birmingham show ‚Äì I‚Äôm really grateful for all the industry professionals that I have connected with. The same goes for so many of my former Category Management & Supplier Acquisition & Onboarding colleagues ‚Äì thank you immensely for your support and all the learnings along the way. I am incredibly proud of what I managed to accomplish in 3 years with my Wayfair Berlin chapter!6 years ago I set out to be a Personal Assistant and somehow ended up in the world of eCommerce, Home D√©cor and Supplier Management! I could not be more grateful to have had the career path that I did. But, 6 years later, I am thrilled to be back on the Executive Assistant track, and I look forward to building my career at Deutsche Bahn. Literally went from ‚Äútoilets to trains‚Äù with this new change of industries! Und noch was dazu ‚Äì meine gesamte Arbeit ist AUF DEUTSCH! (With the occasional English supplier communication!) Admittedly it‚Äôs been quite the adjustment learning all these new train-themed German words ‚Äì but each day gets better and better! And ‚Äì bonus of living in Frankfurt ‚Äì DIRECT flights to Chicago! No more layovers :) USA friends and family ‚Äì you can start planning your visits right meow.If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned in the past couple months, it‚Äôs that if YOU want a change in life ‚Äì YOU have to make it happen! Whether it‚Äôs a job change, career change or location change (or, if you‚Äôre like me ‚Äì all 3 of these at the same time) ‚Äì anything is possible once you STOP asking yourself ‚Äúwhy?!‚Äù and START asking yourself, ‚ÄúWhy not!?‚Äù",4 hours ago

Yakup √ñzt√ºrk,7,,,"KI wird zunehmend in Alltagssituationen eingesetzt, zum Beispiel in intelligenten Lautsprechern und Sprachassistenten wie Amazon Alexa oder Google Assistant, um Nutzeranfragen zu verstehen und darauf zu reagieren.Allerdings nutzen viele Unternehmen KI nur in begrenzten Bereichen. Eine erfolgreiche Integration von KI in den Industrieprozess erfordert einen interdisziplin√§ren Austausch zwischen verschiedenen Parteien und kann mit Aufwand verbunden sein. Um die Vorteile von KI optimal zu nutzen, sollten Unternehmen nicht nur ihre F√§higkeit zur Datensammlung und -haltung einsetzen, sondern auch den Austausch zwischen Datenerzeugern und -nutzern f√∂rdern (Data Mesh). Es empfiehlt sich, KI bereits bei der Prozessentwicklung zu ber√ºcksichtigen und wenn m√∂glich zu integrieren, um ihre zuk√ºnftige Einbindung zu erleichtern.

Janet Jackson Seo,0,,,"How does all this get a business to the top of the front page‚ùìGoogle prefers to display its information at the top of a SERP (Search Engine Results Pages); therefore, entering your business into Google My Business and Maps gives them the incentive to feature you. Filling out all available fields with keywords, answers to questions, photos, and rich data will please the Google algorithms and better your chances at page one ranking. Your business can also appear in geo-location results when users are searching in your neighborhood.When it comes to keywords, local SEO might seem more targeted and less high-level; however, consider that it yields a higher ROI since searching is more than likely serious about finding, and purchasing a product or service.Research the competition in your area and see what comes up first in a Google Maps result. A helpful technique is to enter their URL into Google Keyword Planner and note associated keywords with their website. There are also several free keyword planner services to assist you.‚úÖKeywords Everywhere Chrome Extension‚úÖWord Tracker‚úÖKeywordTool.ioTake those keywords as a guide to incorporate into your list.The Google Keyword Planner can show you the top keywords via search terms.

Tash Courtenay-Smith,7,7 comments,,"Is The Answer Business Model Killing SEO and PPC?Rachel Woods on TikTok has been tracking how AI is transforming the search industry. She's highlighted is the rise of the 'answer business model,' where users no longer want to sift through links but instead want direct answers to their queries.E-commerce brands, listen up: customers ARE going to be bypassing traditional search results.BOTH SEO and PPC are likely to be challenged by the rise of AI-powered assistants and the answer business model.It might not be today, or this month, but this is going to happen.As more users look to get direct answers to their queries rather than clicking through to websites, the traditional approach to SEO may become less effective.Businesses will need to adapt to this shift by focusing on providing direct answers to users' questions and creating content that is optimised for AI-powered assistants.PPC will also be challenged by the rise of AI-powered assistants.In the last month, Instacart added a chat GBT powered grocery shopping assistant, and Shopify added a chat GBT powered shopping assistant.If users are able to get direct answers to their queries through these tools, they may be less likely to click on ads in search results.This presents a fundamental challenge to Google's search business model, which relies heavily on ads.This means that businesses will need to think creatively about how they reach their target audience, and may need to explore new channels and platforms to connect with customers.I honestly think people are in denial about what is coming, especially those heavily invested in traditional SEO and PPC tactics.AI is transforming the search landscape in fundamental ways, and businesses that fail to adapt will fall behind.Please ignore everyone on here who PPC and SEO are all fine and dandy, and everyone who says this won‚Äôt happen.

‚Çøeter y,3,1 comment,,"‚úÖ From Dishwasher to Google and Beyond: A Father's Journey of Resilience and Determination in Pursuing New Opportunities‚úÖAs a father of a family of 5 members, embracing uncertainty can be intimidating. Nevertheless, I recently sold my home in Hong Kong to seize an opportunity with Davionlabs in Singapore, a Bybit subsidiary working on a Layer 2 blockchain network. Before accepting the offer, I thoroughly researched the company culture and management style, despite their history of significant layoffs in 2022. Most of the feedback I received from former and current employees was negative, but I believed in the company's potential and was willing to assume the risk. Regrettably, the gamble did not pay off, and I lost my job after only two months, leaving my family without a home in Hong Kong.Still, my seven years as a crypto trader have taught me to make strategic decisions and remain composed under pressure. I find similarities between this experience and the recent FTX and Silicon Valley Bank incidents, where traders and investors faced immense pressure during market plunges.Throughout my journey, I have learned valuable lessons in resilience, determination, focus, responsibility, and self-discipline. I started from humble beginnings, working as a dishwasher, lifeguard, and property agent. However, inspired by the successes of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, I taught myself to become a software engineer. I have worked in various roles across startups and big tech companies, including DevOps, SRE, and Technical Program Manager, and spent seven years in the crypto industry as a DevSecOps and algo trader.Throughout my career, I have collaborated with engineering teams to enhance application performance and scalability. I have also led global engineering teams, conducted technical interviews, built logging and monitoring solutions, and constructed CICD pipelines for numerous applications. Furthermore, I have also led global DevOps teams, conducted technical interviews from junior roles to head roles.My tenure as a Technical Program Manager at Google honed my communication and technical management abilities. As a Senior DevSecOps in a crypto exchange, I am excited to demonstrate these skills to prospective employers. I am confident that my unique background and skill set can bring value to any organization seeking a resilient, determined, and experienced employee.I am eager to explore further opportunities in Hong Kong or Singapore and would be grateful for any assistance in connecting with potential employers or HR agents.I am thankful for the chance to share my journey with the LinkedIn community. I am optimistic about my ability to contribute to any organization's success and eager to embrace new challenges.Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.#opentowork#work#opportunities#connections#softwareengineer#devops#sre#tpm#neverforgetwhyyoustarted#jobs",6 hours ago

Marwa Khost Jarkas,35,,,"Last year, I was approached byWIREDfor a feature related to what Tech companies are doing to ensure the Arabic language becomes more universally gender neutral.It is a BIG question for sure, as there is so much to do in that field. Arabic is a gendered language, similar to many other languages including, but not limited to, Hindi, Hebrew, French, German, Spanish, etc. For many of those gendered languages, masculine nouns and pronouns have been often used with a generic function to refer to both men and women. This being said, all languages evolve with time and the Arabic language has the appropriate means to be an inclusive language. It is on the speakers and users of the language, as well as, other responsible players (including tech companies, academic organizations, language councils etc) to take part in the evolution of the language to meet the changing needs and development of the society.Here is a quick snippet from the article.Google says it respects diversity, equality, inclusion, and integrity and encourages the expression of these values through inclusive language in its content. For Arabic, as well as other languages (particularly gendered ones), Google uses gender-neutral alternatives, enumerates both forms instead of defaulting to the universal masculine form, and feminizes job titles functions, and grades where applicable. Google Assistant also understands up to 19 colloquial Arabic languages and responds in gender-neutral Modern Standard Arabic.‚ÄúWe have clear inclusive language¬†guidelines and we‚Äôre continuously trying¬†to implement them in as many products¬†and content types as possible,‚Äù says¬†Marwa Khost Jarkas, communications¬†manager at Google MENA. ‚ÄúInclusive¬†language is the language that avoids the¬†use of expressions or words that might be¬†considered to exclude or offend particular¬†groups of people. In other words, it is¬†meant to be a respectful language that is devoid of biases, stereotypes, and¬†potentially offensive, triggering, or exclusionary language.‚ÄùThanksIain Akermanfor this opportunity and for raising this topic.What are your thoughts?EN:https://lnkd.in/dyAdJmVCAR:https://shortest.link/kxns",6 hours ago

Ishan Kumar Giddu,19,,,"AI has understood that multi-sensory engagement is as necessary as (if not more than) text.CTO of Microsoft Germany, Andreas Braun says that GPT-4 will be arriving within the next few days. GPT-4 will be the upgraded version of the GPT-3 language model that runs the current trailblazer ChatGPT.But what could be the difference? Multimodality.The word is heavy but the meaning is relatively simpler - Multimodal AI means artificial intelligence that can accept inputs, read, comprehend, and produce results in text as well as images, video and sound.If integrated in GPT-4, this could be the superior model of Google Image Search or Google Voice Search.While the rumours of GPT-4 having 100 trillion parameters or data points (for comparison, GPT-3 has 175 billion) may have been dispelled by Sam Altman, there‚Äôs no doubt that GPT-4 will have to be based on a much larger data set than its predecessor to be able to give visual outputs and to do so accurately.Accuracy will be a priority because pictures and video are visual elements that are taken in with much more keenness and scrutiny.If successful in integrating multimodality in its model, then I am sure that GPT-4 will bring in ‚ÄòNexGen content‚Äô - content of all forms that has been developed with the collaboration of man and machine. A hint at this is Holger Kenn, Direct of Business Strategy at Microsoft Germany, saying that GPT-4 could assist call centres by automatically converting phone conversations to text and summarising them.GPT-4 could mean quick text prompts creating entire video storyboards, or picture inputs developing an in-depth video structure. It may also mean super-speedy infographics for business meetings, or quick meeting minutes extracted from a video recording - the benefits are truly far reaching!What do you think will be the best use-case of the multimodal GPT-4?#chatgpt4#gpt4#nlp#artificialintelligence#future",6 hours ago

It complies with the WTO-TBT code of good practice for preparing, adopting, and applying standards. In developing National Standards, BIS provides all interested stakeholders a neutral platform to come together and work towards common agreements. BIS provides a forum for Sectional Committees, representing over a thousand experts from organized consumers and consumer bodies, regulatory and other government bodies, industries, scientists, technologists, testing organizations, and individual experts. These committees work to develop consensus-based voluntary National standards with stakeholder consultations. Apart from consultation within the technical committees, draft standards are also open for public views/ comments. A standard, by definition, is a voluntary document.

Sriram Venkatesh aka Debut Journey,14,,,"#GPT4vs#BigbardMicrosoftvsGoogleSentinel, Declare warü´°This story dates back to the financial crisis of 2008, when two tech giants were battling for the best search engines out in the town.The former had the best design, which is seamless, robust architecture and a young team. The latter had half a century experience in the hardware domain and had an unparalleled advantage that every hardware out there in the market had their operating system.The seamless interface won the battle and ruling our hardwares for almost a decade.The cold war between Google and Microsoft led to lot of innovation. This healthy competition gave us Android, Virtual reality hardware, sleek hardware for computing and what not.But when it comes to a open battle, the tech becomes even more advanced.This is the era of AI.Microsoft's strategic investment inOpenAIis a statement to the universe that "" MICROSOFT IS NOT OLD ENOUGH TO ALLOW KIDS RULE THE JUNGLE ""chatGPT made it to the news for almost 20 times in the last 3 months. The model gets new feed of data and the new version GPT4 is out in the market and it brings a lot of new functionalities. Self learning, prompt automation, second layer command genaration and other such features makes this AI the best companion.They even integrated GPT with Bing, that gave creators an edge in content creationOn the other hand, Google's Bard also made it to the news, but in a negative way. It debuts in the market with a factual error leading to a net loss of around $96 Billion Dollar.Well, we have a robust team. Google has been investing time, money and resources for the last few months and they are now ready with the big daddy - "" The BIG BARD ""BIG BARD is now available for internal testing and open for public in the next few months.Few attributes including real time assistance, low error rate , faster learning capacity can decide who wins the race.However, there might be a new entrant in this decade.Elon is coming up with his own open source AIKey opinion leaders in the tech industry are bringing new innovations in the field of AI.Who wins the race will be the winner of this decade.In the last decade, data was the oil.In this decade, Open source data might be the oil.Open source data might be the training data of the feature.#artificialintelligence#google#microsoft#nft#metaverse#web3",6 hours ago

Auch diese k√∂nnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es erm√∂glichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster √∂ffnen zu m√ºssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.üëâ  Warum?

Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfl√§che interagieren zu k√∂nnen.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich √§ndern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig w√§re, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgr√ºnden, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gr√ºnden keine andere M√∂glichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren m√∂glicherweise anders hei√üt.

Levent Bulusan,2,,,"Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was a manager named John who worked at a prominent bank. John was known for his efficiency and dedication, but he always felt that there was more he could do to improve his productivity. Little did he know that his wish was about to come true, thanks to the integration of generative AI tools in Google Workspace.John started his day with a hot cup of coffee while going through his inbox, which was usually filled with numerous emails from his team, other departments, and clients. Before the AI integration, he would spend a significant amount of time drafting responses to each email. However, now Gmail's AI-powered email composition tool was there to lend him a hand.As he opened an email from a team member asking for guidance on a complex transaction, Gmail's AI instantly provided a suggestion that perfectly addressed the concern. John felt a sense of relief as he accepted the suggestion and moved on to the next email, saving valuable time.Later that day, John had to prepare a performance report for his team. Instead of struggling with data analysis, he opened Google Sheets and found that the generative AI had automatically identified trends and presented visualizations for him. This allowed him to focus on the implications of the data and devise strategies to improve his team's performance.During a video conference with a client, John used Google Slides to present a proposal for a new financial product. The AI in Slides had helped him design a visually appealing and persuasive presentation by suggesting suitable images, graphics, and text formatting based on the content. The client was impressed, and the meeting concluded with a successful deal.Throughout the day, John noticed that the AI tools seemed to understand his preferences and style better, as they adapted to his choices and made increasingly relevant suggestions. He appreciated how the AI enhanced his communication, reduced misunderstandings, and personalized his experience.At the end of the day, John reflected on how the generative AI tools in Google Workspace had transformed his daily tasks.
