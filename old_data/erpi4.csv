"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Holy shit. I was skeptical of all the high ceilings being thrown out until I put the pieces together. I honestly think GME is priceless, and the most valuable stock you will ever buy. Here's the full picture, as I understand it...</h1>",missing_the_point_,"First of all, I’d like to start off by stating this post is completely nonpartisan. GME is not a political debate, it’s a class war.Okay, let me ask you guys this — how many of you knew that when the pandemic began, the FED pumped $3 trillion dollars into the markets? I watch the news in the background all day, every day, and I didn’t know at the time when the injections were happening. This news would have been of great interest to me since I day trade, so it would not be something that I wasn’t paying attention to. I just simply wasn’t looking in the right places.You may not have been aware of the pump either because they were discreet. MSM that isn't financial news never mentioned them. And we were even misled about it. How many times did you hear Trump brag that markets being at an all-time high? This literally had nothing to do with how well the economy was doing. Or the markets for that matter. The record high is completely artificial.This isn’t a political issue; this is a class issue. What should infuriate you most is that people were literally starving, unable to pay their rent, and job losses were reaching record highs, while our government withheld aid to desperate Americans, and even took a vacation in the middle of their debate about it. But the Federal Reserve wasted no time (in March 2020) spending trillions of dollars bailing out banks. Again.It was not to protect your retirement accounts. They claimed there was not enough liquidity in the markets, and Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell stated he will do whatever it takes to prevent another Great Depression. But their actions are what is about to cause the next potential Great Depression.Not only was $3 trillion pumped into the market, but the Federal Reserve also lent an additional $1 trillion a day to large banks for 14-days. None of that was taxpayer money, by the way. The FED was just printing money. They loaned TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to big banks, while the U.S. Government told the American people they didn’t even deserve a $600 check of their own, taxpayer money.The banks, investment firms, and hedge funds got too greedy and pumped too much into the market (Here’s what the s&amp;amp;p currently looks like if you haven't seen this image), and the SEC and the DTCC were complicit. Now, there’s too much liquidity. There is more borrowed money than real cash in the market and it has no real value. It’s a house of cards, ready to fall at any moment. The wheels are in motion. It is happening. Correction is imminent.The SEC realized the market bubble at least 6 months ago. You may have heard that big banks recently had huge record-setting sales last week on bonds and were taking advantage of a recent dip in Treasury yields. That was a lie. The SEC told brokers that as of April 22nd, they must have the capital to cover every share they borrowed from investors and lent out to hedge funds. So, banks needed billions of extra capital on hand by April 22nd or they would have had to recall shares.I personally believe that the crash has begun and has been in motion since early February. I wrote a post about it yesterday, after realizing the trends for every stock on my watchlist have been extremely unusual. I received hundreds of comments from people saying they’re noticing the same unusual trend.The crash isn’t obvious to the average person because the stock market has continued to report record highs, every week. However, my trading strategy focuses entirely on penny stocks that are owned by hedge funds known to manipulate the market. Most stocks I invest in are all complete garbage, but I look for pump and dumps, obvious manipulation patterns, and anticipate runners based on near-identical charts of multiple companies. So, none of the stocks on my watchlists are in any of the benchmark indexes like the s&amp;amp;p 500, Nasdaq, and the Dow.In one of the most interesting comments, Comotron explains it perfectly: ""High-momentum stocks, which are risky at any time of the market cycle, are particularly so in the weeks prior to a bull market top. There could be a 'smaller dip first, followed by another rise for a few months and finally a much larger correction that officially ends the bull cycle. That’s the conclusion I reached upon analyzing all U.S. bull markets since 1926. Stocks that are riding a wave of momentum do not crest in unison with the broad market averages. They instead start to lose steam several weeks in advance. It is probably fair to say that ""penny stocks"" fall into the ""high-momentum stocks"" category. Either way, based on historical data, there appear to be credible indicators that suggest a market correction might happen in the near future.”That information is fucking. fascinating. From early December to mid-January, the market was ridiculously bullish. I literally made more money in one month than my annual salary. Then all of a sudden, every single one of my stocks just started trending downward, had a short rise, and have continued to bleed for the past few weeks. All of them. Exactly the same time. And exactly like he said in the comment.There has definitely already been a mass sell-off of securities by hedge funds who have lost AT LEAST 70 billion dollars in the past quarter, because of the tremendously dangerous and reckless risks they’ve taken recently, which alone would have crashed the market without the pump from the Federal Reserve. As we know, the hedge funds knew it would too, but gambled with our money anyway. This is just the beginning. There is a domino effect of bankruptcies on the way for hedge funds.We know the media has recently reported that investment banks and hedge funds had record-breaking quarters recently. Which, technically they did. But that’s because losses are only reported when you sell. They have not covered any of the short positions yet and are paying millions of dollars every single day until they do. In fact, capital from the mass sell-off isn’t going towards paying off their debt, millions of dollars are going towards suppressing this information, manipulating the market for more capital, and reducing losses. What they’re doing is completely illegal and the media is not reporting it, the left or the right-wing media. It’s because they’re all controlled by billionaires. In the past three months, I have never seen so much lying and corruption in my life.As the SEC’s deadline to secure capital approaches there have been other signs that things are going to blow up very soon. For instance:The SEC announced in a press release that it will award a record-breaking $114 million to whistleblowers whose information and assistance lead to the successful enforcement of SEC and related actions.Gary Gensler was confirmed as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday. He was sworn on Saturday. What’s interesting about that is that it’s not typical to be sworn in on Saturdays. The last SEC chairman to be sworn in on a Saturday was George Bradford Cook, and it was before the Watergate scandal broke.When all this does break, they will try to change the narrative. They’re going to blame it on retail traders and say overvalued stocks bought during the pandemic caused the crash. Fox will probably even blame the Biden administration. But either way, they’ve already started pushing an alternative narrative. For example, CNN linked an interview with some dude (I really don’t care enough to look for his name or the video, because I don’t find him credible) who owns a market intelligence company. The guy apparently predicted every single market crash since 1987’s Black Monday. I watched the whole interview, and he went on and on about how there will be a market crash soon and said the reason is that tech stocks are overvalued right now. If he were an actual market expert explaining the upcoming market bubble, he would have mentioned any of the information above, but he didn’t. He strictly talked about tech stocks.So, yeah, it’s out there. Billionaires control the stock market, media, and our politicians.I don’t know about you guys, but I’m fucking sick of it. And for that, they need to pay.The Ceiling/Floor:There are many factors in all this that we need to calculate into our ceiling/floor. First of all, we should demand back the $17 trillion dollar bailout given to banks, that was gambled away recklessly, and will inevitably crash our economy.$17 trillion / 55.6 million (float) = $303,571.00/shareThat would be my floor if there was no market bubble. But there is. And it’s their fault. Therefore, our floor should hold them accountable for the massive amount of money Americans are about to lose when the market crashes. The only problem (for hedge funds) is that no one knows how much this is going to cost.For that reason, I believe GME is priceless. They can't afford to keep the price down, once the squeeze begins. We literally choose the price. The limit does not exist.I believed it before, but I see it now. And I have all the information, which makes me believe we are owed this money. Not just for past for corruption, but to cover future, unavoidable losses.I ask you all to stop fighting about the floor and ceiling, take down your sell limits, and repeat after me:“My shares are not for sale.”Stop thinking about selling. I will remind you again that we own the float. They’re paying millions of dollars in interest each day and will eventually be forced to cover. Force the liquidity to dry up. Watch buy orders rise from $1,000, $5,000, $10,000…$1,000,000…because they’re not being filled.Sell when you feel comfortable and believe it’s an amount you deserve. Everyone has different risk tolerances, not everyone will sell at the same time, and we know the original members of r/wallstreetbets have an extremely and unusually high tolerance for risk. So, trust us and each other.This really is a revolution. As Scaramucci Tweeted, this is like the modern-day French Revolution of finance. Gamestop is a MOTHERFUCKING (Keith) GILL-OTINE.This is the way.Trust me. Everything is going to be fine.Edit: Since this hit r/all, I thought I would mention that I am a female because WSBs has gotten a lot of criticism about it being a ""boys' club"". It isn't.Edit 2: Yo, Mr. Gensler - FOR SOME REASON, Jay Clayton and the mainstream media were unable to figure most of this information out. (I know, crazy!) So, will I be receiving my $114 million whistleblower check in the mail...or...? Also, Jay Clayton might not be aware he's out of a job yet. You guys may want to let him know.

It is a system to be applied in a future machine, PS5, and that allows the CPU of the new console to be able to ""interpret"" the central unit of the previous machines. The author of the development was Mark Cerny, the architect who designed the PS4 structure, and the patent, which has been filed under number 2019-503013, briefly explains what it consists of.The aim is to make the applications designed for the previous consoles (legacy device) run perfectly on the most powerful hardware, and is focused on eliminating the synchronization errors between the new consoles and the behavior of the previous ones (PS4, PS3, PS2 and PSX). For example, if the CPU of the new console is faster than the previous one, data could be overwritten prematurely, even if they were still being used by another component.Thanks to the new system, PS5 would be able to imitate the behavior of the previous consoles, so that the information that arrives at the different processors is returned in response to the ""calls"" of the games. The processor is able to detect the needs of each application and behave as if it were the original ""brain"" of each machine, cheating the software. This technology does not prevent PS5 could also have additional processors to have compatibility with machines whose architecture is difficult to replicate, as in the case of PS2.In this blog you can see the most detailed information of the patent, with the diagrams in Japanese. Yesterday we explained the SRGAN process that allows you to perform ""remastering by emulation"" (another of the elements that Sony has patented, and converts images in SD resolution in 4K using artificial intelligence.Source",4 years ago,19.7k,1.5k comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/am1ilp/sony_patents_a_new_system_of_backward/

""A PERSON FAMILIAR... ok sorry but I'm not believing this until I see some filings backing this claim up, just like Cramer said in the video that a hedge fund manager would create a narrative which was beneficial for them.How is this beneficial for them? I would have no clue, but I would argue that they will find a way to make this beneficial.The thing is when it comes to companies they can't make false claims, but if they ""leak"" information to the press, those liable claims are gone as it was an ""anonymous source"" and they can still push a story without having to worry about any SEC/governmental litigation .So when a news story comes out that feeds into your confirmation bias you should be just as sceptical about it as if it where to go against it. remember they know we would love to see a story like this and this could also help them spin a narrative that they want for example:Melvin closed their short positions due to 49% loss49% loss forces Melvin capital to take long positions which where shortAnd these are just two examples from the top of my head.So again use Critical thinking  and think, who would benefit from this, how would they, why would they do this, what could the possible outcome be of that?Again it's fully possible this entire story is real, but I personally don't trust it to be factualJust keep an eye out I feel like there is a ""melvin covered"" story coming so stick with what we know, hodl.Now this part is fully gut feeling.For some reason I've been getting the back of my neck standing on edge, I personally feel there will be some new FUD coming something that will require the sub to DO SOMETHING FAST.So everyone I know most people have a kneejerk reaction and want to help.There isn't a sense of urgency, so if someone comes here saying HEY DO THIS NOW! please don't.Question everything and everyone, be kind to one and other and continue to be civil, and move slowly and carefully.DFV's latest tweet, just look at this beauty!now let's go over this for a bit,Exercise none  - will cash the difference between the strike price and the current share/price at the termination dateExercise some - only partially execute (order) his optionsExercise all- Buy the full option chain, aka buy all 50k at market.If you want to add to the vote feel free to chime in if you'd like to.I personally hope he'll exercise all of them, just imagine if he'd bought 500 at the press of a button, I'm actually wondering what would happen if he exercised the 500 order at once as one block, he'll get them for 12$ a piece so... for me it's a no brainer, if you could pay 1/10th of the current price or less to get something worth the same as the current stock would you? because I wouldWill DFV? yeah most likely he bought at 45$ so why wouldn't he get it at 12$Addendum: because people keep speculating, no this will most likely not affect the share price at the market as these options where ""hedged"" a long time ago, it would just give our boy DFV some more shares for a better price then just at the market price.“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">How Much Text is in Animal Crossing, and Why You Should Care</h1>",Balloon_Monsoon,"Hi Reddit, last week I made a post about the Mario + Rabbids development process and New Coke. That post was received well and had some great discussion, and so I wanted to write down some more of my thoughts on the thing I keep seeing on this subreddit: a difficulty by longtime Animal Crossing fans in describing for those who haven't played understand what makes the series special. I would love your comments on why you think the series matters and is fun, and whether you think I've hit it here or missed the mark. Again, about a 1600 word read, so I understand that it won't be for everyone. Thanks!Look around, and you’ll start seeing this recurrent and meaningless conversation everywhere. It starts with the questioner, who asks: as someone who has never played Animal Crossing, why should I get the new one?  Clearly, this questioner is intrigued but lost: presumably after a few minutes researching the game, they have been struck by the conviction that there’s nothing to do in it. I must be missing something, the questioner thinks. The eager answerers are quick to jump in, but they offer little. You fish, many say. You can decorate your house, adds another. Countless eager answerers point out that the core gameplay is about paying off your loan. The questioner’s inner monologue is raised to a frenzy: no, I asked why I SHOULD get this game!The answers are unhelpful because they describe elements of Animal Crossing’s gameplay, and gameplay is not where the franchise shines brightest. In fact, I will argue that almost no one was ever won over by Animal Crossing’s gameplay.So instead of examining Animal Crossing’s gameplay, let’s tackle this question from another angle: the number of words in the game.In an “Iwata Asks” interview regarding Animal Crossing: City Folk, the series’ installment on the Wii, director Aya Kyogoku suggested that the script was 1.6 million Japanese characters. Satoru Iwata notes that this is 4000 pages of solid text. If we use the ratio of 2.5 Japanese characters for every English word, that gives us 640,000 words in the script.In an interview with Kotaku, the Nintendo Treehouse staff said that for Animal Crossing: New Leaf (the most recent 3DS, non-spinoff title), the script came in at 2.4 million Japanese characters. If we use that same ratio, that’s 960,000 words in the script.But we can get even more specific than the Japanese, and we should, as Animal Crossing games can’t just be translated. The localization process involves writers that American-ize, and yes, redo the script. Jokes in particular need a lot of tinkering. New, relevant holidays need to be worked in; foreign and unfamiliar ones are scrapped. Entire characters don’t make sense in the new language, and need to be completely reworked.So go see that final product for yourself: download the full script for New Leaf.You’ll see that player initiated conversations and letters from animals (located in the “Talk,” “MailR,” and “MailN” folders) take up about 60 megabytes of data, spread out in 3,034 files. That gives us an average file size of just under 20 kilobytes. Each file has the text translated into three languages alongside plenty of code, so it’s difficult to estimate exactly how many words are in each file “per kilobyte.” I looked at average-sized (20 kilobyte) files and used a word count tool on a bunch of them. That gave me a pretty consistent average of 360 words in every 20 kilobyte file.If there are 3,034 files of text, and they have an average of 360 words, we can multiply 3,034 files times 360 words per file to get an estimated word count:It’s approximately 1,092,240 words.Some context: that would mean that the Bible doesn’t come close to New Leaf’s English text: the King James Version is 783,000 words. Animal Crossing also edges out the entirety of the Harry Potter series, which combines for 1,084,000 words. Maybe other large video games have it beat? Well, classic computer RPG's like Baldur's Gate II and visual novels are in the same neighborhood, but your standard open world, 21st century RPGs are not: the Witcher 3 clocks in at only 450,000 words. Not even close, baby.Back to Animal Crossing, though: if you could squeeze about 275 words per page at 12 point font, the English text of Animal Crossing: New Leaf makes for a book of just under 4,000 pages. 3,971 to be exact.Given that the average person can expect to read 250 words per minute if they really try, it would take them 4369 minutes to get through the Animal Crossing New Leaf English script. That’s 72.8 hours, or just more than 3 days, of straight reading.But there’s another way to think about that number: I booted up Animal Crossing: New Leaf today, and got into a conversation with one of my favorite residents, Frobert. Our conversation was 63 words. We talked again: 65 words. Again: 70. Based on this short test, if I talked two times to 10 residents / other NPC’s a day, and then sent one letter every day, and did this in perfectly optimal fashion (somehow managing to never repeat a conversation), it would still take me 821 days to have a chance to see every message. Alternatively, since Animal Crossing: New Leaf first released 2,419 days ago, I would have had to talk to seven animals a day once a day for the past seven years, sending some letters here and there, to see every message. All of this, of course, doesn’t even account for unique events and holidays.The point is, no one has seen every message, and no one ever will.Kotaku picked up on this, and asked the folks at Nintendo Treehouse (the brains behind Nintendo’s localization process) if this makes their work seems pointless: is it really worth it “…to spend that much time working on dialogue that most people will never even get to read”? But the production team couldn’t disagree more. Aya Kyogoku, who will be the Director for New Horizons, put it like this:“The reason we prepared all of these messages is so when you’re playing with someone else, they’ll come across a message you’ve never seen before and maybe they’ll show it to you—’Oh my gosh, look how funny this thing is.’”Nintendo Treehouse lead Nate Bihlldorf agrees:“Those messages I always thought were the most fun in the game, because they were so private… putting a little something extra into that message so you knew that no matter what they were gonna be smiling when they saw it, cause you knew the writer was winking at you when they wrote it.”In fact, one of the biggest points of consensus of the team behind Animal Crossing is that the text of Animal Crossing has a responsibility to go beyond being “fun,” actually teaching the player about the depth of human communication. Ann Lin, one of the writers at Nintendo Treehouse, discusses writing the letters you get when you find out a villager is moving away:“When I was working on letters like that… I was always trying to make it as tear-jerky as possible, acknowledging that this was a real relationship that is ending, and… trying to elicit that emotion out of the reader.”And the creator of the series, Katsuya Eguchi takes it one step further:“For instance, the seagull Johnny [named Gulliver in the US versions] makes all these dark jokes. I’m sure a kid won’t understand them. I imagined he would have to go to his Mom and ask her what the seagull was talking about, and the Mom would then have a hard time answering.”C’mon, a wry, suggestive seagull? Is this whole script just a gimmick? No, Hisashi Nogami, series producer says, also commenting on Gulliver’s humor:“We mixed in difficult sections like that… [because] communication is what we ultimately want people to take away from Animal Crossing*—and there’s no better example of it than that.”*Now, we’re starting to get at the idea that’s unique, the thing that separates Animal Crossing from everything else: communication - a chiefly human skill - taught through animals.Actually, does anyone get this joke?The challenge, particularly when it comes to explaining the draw of Animal Crossing, is that communication is not a gameplay element. It doesn’t actually happen within the cartridge, as you can’t truly communicate with the animals. Your animals are pre-programmed with messages and they are imbued with no intelligence, real or artificial. Their habits may grow more familiar to you, but they cannot truly learn. Even their ability to “read” the letters you send them is little more than a script that checks for grammar and capitalization.If you agree with me so far, then you’ll agree that the core of what makes Animal Crossing is not its gameplay, but the illusion of an experience. The developers have crammed so much text into these critters that the illusion becomes compelling. Some say that the cycle of paying off your loans gives the game a sense of realism. I think the part of the series truest to real life is that your experience is unique and limited, and you will never see everything in one lifetime.This endlessly big world (even if it is physically much smaller than, say, Hyrule) creates an experience, and if that experience clicks for you, the gameplay will come naturally: you will create it even where there is none. You will find yourself meticulously crafting letters to animals that can’t read. You will insist upon doing so. Strung on by the seemingly endless permutations of conversations and “comic mischief,” as the ESRB calls it, you will continue to be drawn in well past the point that the game has actual incentives to bring you back. It isn’t surprising that Animal Crossing has been the origins of that some of the most wholesome video game experiences, such as the 87-year-old Grandma who played 3500 hours, or Chuggaaconroy’s most meaningful Let’s Play conclusion.I haven’t played enough games to say for certain whether Animal Crossing is “unique” in that regard. But I do know that is unique in what it offers: the illusion of experience - quite separate from any gameplay elements - that reels people in like a Sea Bass on the fifth nibble.This is why Animal Crossing fans are obnoxiously excited that a new installment is on the way. It’s not a whole new world, it’s a whole new impossible set of lifetimes waiting just around the corner.It’s literal books of text we will never be able to read… and that’s the magic.Sources and Further ReadingIGN: “Nintendo Voice Chat: The Charming People Behind Animal Crossing.” [Podcast]Kotaku: “Nintendo’s Secret Weapon.” Nintendo Online Monthly, Interview with Katsuya Eguchi and Hisashi Nogami.

I grew up in Johannesburg from 1992-1999 - during this time, it was twice as bad as it is now.As a child, I grew up constantly hearing of harrowing personal accounts from family friends who were carjacked and robbed at gun point. The government would run advertisements on television advising people to not stop for traffic lights at night unless absolutely necessary.The flats we lived in had 3 levels of security - a spiked metal fence for the complex, steel reinforced doors for the unit, and another layer of steel reinforced doors to go upstairs where the bedrooms were.The straw that broke the camel's back was when one of our close family friends was fatally shot in his own home during an intrusion.My mother decided to take a leap of faith and bring me and my sister to the United States on an H-1B visa paying a relatively meager wage. We were evicted from my aunt's house after 3 months, and another relative took us in until my mother could afford our own apartment.9 years in the Marine Corps and an MBA later, I decided to tackle an issue that I am deeply passionate about and started a company that develops AI software to automatically identify gun threats. We have now raised over $10 million of venture funding and have our technology deployed on nearly 20,000 cameras across over 1,200 buildings and sites.I realize that technology alone won't come remotely close to solving gun violence, but it is our hope that our small group of thoughtful and committed citizens can move the needle in a meaningful way.Ask me anything!Here are a recent article about us:https://www.fox5ny.com/news/artificial-intelligence-surveillance-camerasSort of Related: I adopted a kitten 10 months ago.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Science AMA Series: We are evolution researchers at Harvard University, working on a broad range of topics, like the origin of life, viruses, social insects, cancer, and cooperation. Today is Charles Darwin’s birthday, and we’re here to talk about evolution. AMA!</h1>",Darwin_Day,"Hi reddit! We are scientists at Harvard who study evolution from all different angles. Evolution is like a “grand unified theory” for biology, which helps us understand so many aspects of life on earth. Many of the major ideas about evolution by natural selection were first described by Charles Darwin, who was born on this very day in 1809. Happy birthday Darwin!We use evolution to understand things as diverse as how infections can become resistant to drug treatment and how complex, cooperative societies can arise in so many different living things. Some of us do field work, some do experiments, and some do lots of data analysis. Many of us work at Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, where we study the fundamental mathematical principles of evolutionOur attendees today and their areas of expertise include:Dr. Martin Nowak - Prof of Math and Bio, evolutionary theory, evolution of cooperation, cancer, viruses, evolutionary game theory, origin of life, eusociality, evolution of language,Dr. Alison Hill - infectious disease, HIV, drug resistanceDr. Kamran Kaveh - cancer, evolutionary theory, evolution of multi-cellularityCharleston Noble - graduate student, evolution of engineered genetic elements (“gene drives”), infectious disease, CRISPRSam Sinai - graduate student, origin of life, evolution of complexity, genotype-phenotype predictionsDr. Moshe Hoffman- evolutionary game theory, evolution of altruism, evolution of human behavior and preferencesDr. Hsiao-Han Chang - population genetics, malaria, drug-resistant bacteriaDr. Joscha Bach - cognition, artificial intelligencePhil Grayson - graduate student, evolutionary genomics, developmental genetics, flightless birdsAlex Heyde - graduate student, cancer modeling, evo-devo, morphometricsDr. Brian Arnold - population genetics, bacterial evolution, plant evolutionJeff Gerold - graduate student, cancer, viruses, immunology, bioinformaticsCarl Veller - graduate student, evolutionary game theory, population genetics, sex determinationPavitra Muralidhar - graduate student, evolution of sex and sex-determining systems, genetics of rapid adaptationWe will be back at 3 pm ET to answer your questions, ask us anything!EDIT: Thanks everyone for all your great questions, and, to other redditors for helping with answers!

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">You want to escalate to tier 3 support? Okay, there's a process for that, let's do it.</h1>",New_Expression_5724,"I worked in customer support for a tech firm, and if I may say so, the company is good at it and I am good at it.  We have customer satisfaction stories and data to prove it.  Our customer support is what gives us a competitive advantage in our marketplace and makes us very profitable.One day, I get a phone call from a customer.  I say ""hello, my "" and his response is, ""I want to talk to 3rd tier support"".""Okay.  We have a process for that.  What seems to be the problem?""""No, you don't understand.  I don't want to talk to you, I want to talk to 3rd tier support""""Actually, I *do* understand.  You want to talk to 3rd tier support.  I'm setting that up.  But there are a few questions I have to ask you and if I don't know the answers to those questions. then they aren't going to call you, they are going to ask me to call you back and get those answers.  So, what seems to be the problem?""He explains to me the problem.""Have you tried this?""""No, you don't understand.  I don't want to talk to you.  I want to talk to 3rd tier support, you know, the guys who aren't working from a script""""I assure you, sir, I am not working from a script.  Have you tried this?""""Yes, I did, now may I talk to 3rd tier support?""""Have you tried that?""""Yes, I did, now may I talk to 3rd tier support?  My problem isn't on your script""""There is no script for this problem.  I am asking you this question because I thoroughly understand our device and I know, from previous experience, that that might solve your problem"".""Have you tried this other thing?""""What makes you think that this other thing is going to solve the problem?""""Well, I've been doing this work for a couple of years now, and I have a pretty good idea of how these things work.  So I thought this other thing might solve the problem.""""Look, I have a master's degree in computer science.  I want to talk to somebody in 3rd tier support"".Now, I do not want to disrespect computer scientists, because CS is hard field to get into.  But everybody should understand that there is a big difference between computer scientists, computer programmers, system administrators, database administrators, network administrators, cyber security analysts, program managers, and customer support people.   Computer scientists do research on artificial intelligence, algorithms, compiler design, large databases, and other theoretical topics.   Those are important topics.  Computer programmers, by way of contrast, write computer programs.  They need to know about computer science topics, but computer science is a means not an end.  The same is true for all of the other specialties that I mentioned.  He may be a really good computer scientist, but that doesn't mean he a network administrator or a system administrator - those are different specialties.  Somebody who says, ""I have a master's degree in computer science, I don't need to talk to you"" knows a great deal about what he knows, but doesn't know what he doesn't know.   I've been around long enough to know that there is a great deal I don't know.""Just try this other thing, and if that doesn't work, then I will give you to 3rd tier support""""Promise?""""Promise""I can hear him typing away in the background, swearing, and cursing.  I can hear when he hits the return key because he hits it hard.  Then he picks up the phone and says:""it's working now"".""Great.  You still want me to escalate to 3rd tier support?""Then I get a torrential outpouring of expletives.  Since this is a family channel, I won't give the details but rather leave it to your imagination, gentle reader.  Then he hung up on me.Wouldn't you know it?  He got a customer satisfaction survey and I got straight zeroes.I got called into my boss's office and we had a conversation about the call.  He was upset, and I can't say I blame him because he also gets graded on our survey scores.  He called in some 3rd tier support people to listen to the recording (""For training and quality assurance purposes"") and they said I did everything right - he (me) did not deserve that rating.  They also said that there was no way I deserved that abuse and that the survey should be tossed out.  Unfortunately, the rules are the rules and that score counted.  So I lost my quarterly bonus, a couple of thousand dollars.  However, the big boss felt awful about the whole affair, so he and his wife took my wife and me out to dinner at the most expensive restaurant in town.  We had a lovely time.  At the end of the evening, I noticed that he paid for the meal with his personal, not his corporate credit card.  I asked him about that.  His response was golden: ""I'm in a position where I could probably get away with it, but that wouldn't be right.  What happened to you wasn't right either.  This dinner is my way of making it up to you as best I can, and I figured if I am going to do that, I might as well take my wife and your wife along.  Why not?""  (He knew I was married because I have the ring).  I love that guy.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Riot's ""Sandbox Mode"" reply makes it obvious how little they seem to understand the competitive setting of their game.</h1>",ProxyDamage,"The second is that players want to practice very specific skills without the constraints of a regular game. For this point, our stance is that sandbox mode is not the way to go. We want to make sure we’re clear: playing games of League of Legends should be the unequivocal best way for a player to improve. While there are very real skills one can develop in a hyperbolic time chamber, we never want that to be an expectation added onto an already high barrier to entry.To put it mildly: What a crock of shit.I'm guessing that in Riot's world learning to play football means only playing entire 90 minute matches. Learning to play Basketball? Only 4 quarters of 5 x 5. Learning to play Street Fighter? No training mode for you son, straight to ranked! Learning CS:GO? Full ranked matches only. No practice matches, no practicing your spray, nothing - full games or bust!Pick ANY competitive game of any kind and it should be obvious the incredibly ignominious status of that statement. I can't believe any sane person would honestly argument that wanting to practice and improve a specific part of any game should never be acceptable, and that the only way to improve should be to play the full game. That someone connected to one of the currently most popular competitive games in the world thinks this is troubling to say the least.I'll go one step further: A ""sandbox"" or ""training"" mode would be a million times better and more relevant practice than playing AI.Playing AI teaches you nothing but bad habits which come from playing against an adversary that,  due to its very nature, will never ""play the player"" - and a particularly dumb one at that. Even if you improved your bots immensely, short of creating actual artificial intelligence, you'll never create bots that act like players - ANY players, be them good or bad. You create poor facsimiles, nothing but sad uncanny-valley homunculi that only appear human on the most shallow of surfaces. A big part of LoL (or any ""PvP"" competitive setting) is playing the player, learning to predict, counter and even manipulate their actions, and preventing the same from happening to you. Even the best of current game AIs can't do that. They can do mathematical calculations and run down pre-defined courses of action. They're not capable of creative action or ""yomi"". And that's a BEST case scenario. The bots you have have now are the incredibly dumb kind that only get harder by cheating - magically getting better items regardless of gold, ""aimbotting"", seeing you through the fog of war...etc. You're not playing League of Legends against those bots.The lack of a training or sandbox mode of some kind has been a huge failure for LoL, and a positive point for the competition. Both HotS and SMITE, for example, feature some form of practice mode - which should be embarrassing to you. Both of the ""new kids"" (comparatively to you) have figured this shit out that far before you? It's not like we're asking for something incredibly complex - A mode with a few simple extra options inside a 1-vs-1 AI mode would not be perfect, but it would be a massive improvement over the nothing we have:Tons of starting gold by default in sandbox modeLevel upLevel down/reset level (or reset everything including stacks)Toggle minions/AI on and offRespawn structuresRespawn jungleRefresh cooldowns + full manaIf you really want to go ""all out"" (as in, something a newbie modder could do in a few minutes) you can add a spawner/de-spawner command! OMG!There ya go. Don't tell me that's difficult to do. You don't even have SMITE's issue of being 3D (and thus requiring physical in-game interfaces), you can do the same as HotS and just have some small buttons on the top of the HUD... That alone would be enough to let people practice their combos, their skillshots, test different setups... Outside of setting up a match and waiting 5 minutes to try anything with a flash.And don't give me this...the risk of Sandbox mode ‘grinding’ becoming an expectation...particular brand of bullshit. You're expected to not suck shit in any game mode already, by exactly the same people that would expect you not to be a gigantic turd if the training mode existed. People who would rage then rage now. Should we disable casuals/non-ranked because you're expected to learn there before jumping on ranked? Should we disable ARAM or Dominion because they're effectively not Summoner's Rift? The only difference that a training mode would make is that you would actually have the convenient tools to improve the aspects of your game you want to.TL;DR: Riot's excuse is a pile of shit. The tools to improve specific parts of your game without having to play a ""full game"" should exist, as in every other competitive setting, and there is no legitimate reason not to have training mode any more than to remove AI games (in fact, AI games are worse as they only teach you bad habits).Edit: Typos and such, also thanks for the gold kind stranger!EDIT #2: Found a Riot reply among the thousands of comments. Sorry for the delay in ""pinning"" it here, but there are a lot of comments to sift through:RiotBanksyThere's a lot of your argument that I agree with (especially this part)>Don't tell me that's difficult to do.And to make it clear we are not completely opposed to building systems to practice and improve at League. We think there is real player value in a some version of a training mode, especially when one considers the sometimes complex champions we introduce to League. Just as much as you, we understand League is a competitive game by design and, for most, best enjoyed as player vs. player. But for those who want to double down on their skills, League should provide avenue for them as well.The blog's intent was to peel back the curtain and give you transparency into the trade offs we are making in development. We knew that some things we are (and aren't) doing wouldn't win us any popularity contests but imo talking about this stuff is better than turning a deaf ear to players. Our explanation on Sandbox is weak, straight up.  We made it sound like a binary decision which it's not. The strength of the message (or lack therein) reflects the internal Riot debate about how to best solve the problem for players. I think our product, engineering, and design teams are fully capable of solving this in a innovative way that players can use.  The unpopular thing is that it is not on the currently an item in development but based on this feedback it may be that's what we need to adjust.",8 years ago,11.3k,2.9k comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3fxo33/riots_sandbox_mode_reply_makes_it_obvious_how/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">I don't like the relationship between my husband and his ""work wife"", and neither does her partner.</h1>",toohottooheavy,"I am NOT OP. Original post by u/wild-gas8551 in r/trueoffmychesttrigger warning: suicide I don't like the relationship between my husband and his ""work wife"", and neither does her partner. - 21 October 2022English is not my first language, I just want to put it out there because I see how you people are brutal when grammar is bad.I'm a beautician (f35) married to an engineer (m34). He is very intelligent and I'm always proud of him. He has a colleague who is also very intelligent (f31), obviously, that he is close to. Before the events that lead me to this moment of seeking help online, I never had any reason to be uncomfortable about his relationship with her. I always  felt secure in our relationship. We're both independent people who would just leave if we weren't happy together. We've been together for 5 years, married for 1,5.My husband and I were on a 3 days trip with my husbands colleagues. A tradition at his work every autumn. We came home yesterday morning. I had a bad taste in my mouth after this trip. It felt like me and the colleague's partner (m35ish) where the third (and fourth) wheel to my husband and his colleague during the entire trip. During dinner, the second night. I was sitting silently playing with my food after almost two days of being ignored. The partner was also silent at first but we started talking a bit asking each other generic questions.The colleague who was in a very loud argument with my husband (more of a back and forth teasing) suddenly turned around and asked what we two (partner and me) were up to talking quietly. Her partner said that were just getting to know each other since they (husband and colleague) were too busy talking about things we knew nothing about. The colleague laughed and said: What could we discuss with you? Make up and Kim Kardashian?, and she nodded towards me. We have more intelligent things to discuss.I was dumbfounded. I guess because I'm a beautician I can only discuss Kim Kardashian? I mean any outsider to any profession would be dumb listening into two people discussing work related subjects. they could've been as ignorant if I was talking to my co workers about our job. My husband just laughed and the partner said: That's rude. I said nothing because I had distaste for the whole situation. On the last day of the trip I spent most of my time with the partner. I ignored the other two.Yesterday evening the partner dmed me and wanted to talk about our SO's. He said that he has been feeling uncomfortable about his gf's relationship with my husband and that he went through her messages. He sent me screens where my husband and his colleague are basically calling me stupid and shallow and laugh about it.Well mostly the colleague saying mean things and my husband laughing and adding in. Sometimes he would say something like: No I love her (about me) and she would answer: You only like bangin hot dumb chicks, and they laugh. When the texts aren't about my stupidity, they're about work and In one of them my husband wrote: I love your brain!!! to her.I started crying when I saw the screenshots. Never have I ever felt so self conscious about my brains or profession. I love my job and I thought my husband loved it too or at least didn't have this disdain for it. I've been my own boss for over 10 years and I make closer to 6 figures. I never thought myself as a dumb person. I like to think that I'm fairly well informed and I have passion for history, languages, cultures etc but yes I'm not an engineer working on some design for artificial hearts. Still, the texts complimenting the colleague, hurt me more than the ones making fun of me. I don't know why.I think my husband and his colleague are out of line at best and, well probably screwing. I still don't know what to do. The last thing I wanna be is the insecure wife. If he isn't happy with me why is he here?ps: I wrote this post last night and fell asleep afterwards. this morning I just went to work. OMG guys! thank you so much for the support and the beautiful words. I will try to read all your comments and messages. I just wanted to make this edit to explain why I haven't answered any of you. I'm sorry and thank you. I will talk to my husband tonight or maybe tomorrow. I will make an update about my situation. update:I don't like the relationship between my husband and his ""work wife"", and neither does her partner. - 25 October 2022Sorry I did't come back earlier to make an update, I was mentally exhausted and of course busy discussing Kim K. Anyway I want to apologize for not answering your messages because I got over 200 asking for updates. I really hope you can find this.I have talked to my husband. I just told him that I have talked to work wife's BF and showed him the messages I was sent. My husband asked my why her BF was spying on his gf and I told him that it was because he did't like the way things went down on the trip. I told him how I too was very uncomfortable.He was very confused and told me that work wife obviously was jealous and that I shouldn't care about her. I told him that she didn't bother as much as the fact that he was fine, no, amused by her attempts to bring me down the entire time. So much in fact that her BF was so uncomfortable that he went through her phone. I also asked him why he was letting her trash talking me in their texts.Again he insisted that he just felt that she was petty and jealous and did't want to stoop to her level. He said that I did the same when I ignored her rudeness and he thought that was the classy thing to do. I asked him why she was doing this. Was there anything between them and to please tell me now before it got more complicated? He said of course not and if there was something from her end then that wasn't his problem because he loved me and so on and so forth. I asked him about him ""loving her brain"" and he said it was strictly about something work related and offered to show me the conversation.Next day I was still brooding, so he came to me, kissed me and apologized and told me that I was right and that he was being stupid but that he never thought about it as disrespect but some female jealousy that he thought was pitiful and beneath him. He promised to do better. I told him that if somebody was trashing you like this in front of me, no matter how petty their reasons were or how pathetic I thought they were, I would've hated them and never wanted them in my life. Unfortunately I started crying then and he told me that he was so sorry. That was on Sunday.Yesterday, the BF called me again and we talked (we had decided to talk after confronting our SOs). Their conversation was worse and work-wife admitted to her BF that she had feeling for my husband and she suspected that my husband had feelings for her too. They have kissed at the summer work party . I showed my husband the screenshot when he got home. He started to freak out telling me that yes, she did kiss him and he rebuffed her and told her that he wasn't interested.That was when she got nastier towards me. -So you knew she had a thing for you? and he said yes. I asked him to show me his phone and he had deleted his conversation with her. He said it was because he was embarrassed. He didn't tell me when the kiss happened and now he was afraid I would think it was more than what it was.I asked him to move out and he is currently at his mother's. He keeps saying that there's nothing between them. That he loves me and would never cheat on me. That he will make her come clean to me. That he will quit his job and never see her again. I'm just so broken hearted right now and all I want is to cry. thank you for listening. I needed this.edit: maybe I should have mentioned that he also told me he could prove that it was she who came on to him because it happened in the office cafeteria and there are surveillance cameras and that he could request the clip from that day. I dont know why I didn't include it. Maybe because who kissed who doesn't really change how  I feel about this whole ordeal. UPDATE2:I don't like the relationship between my husband and his ""work wife"", and neither does her partner. - 26 October 2022Hi! I dont feel comfortable making a new update on the true sub because honestly I'm embarrassed that I'm taking so much of your attention. Writing however has helped me a lot, like it's therapy.My husband showed up at my work today. He said that he has never felt so scared in his life like when he realized that he was losing me. He has contacted the BF, apologized to him and asked him to forward all the texts between him and work wife. He printed them and gave me everything. Over a year's worth of texting. He told me when work wife confessed to her BF. she sent the text about admitting the kiss to her BF(the text I got a screenshot of). My husband panicked and deleted the whole conversation. But now he got everything from the BF and I could read it.He also had brought a picture with him. Of him when he was young, 12-13ish with a girl. He said he searched this picture now he's living with his mom. He told me that it was his favorite cousin and that she committed suicide when they were 16. She was bullied severely. I never heard my husband talk about this cousin. I know of her from his family but never that they were close or that her death devastated him. He said that he still wasn't ready to discuss her but that now he needed to.He admitted that when work wife started working for them august 2021 he immediately bonded with her because she reminded him of his cousin. Both goofy, funny and extremely intelligent. They even looked alike a little (kind of true). The bond got stronger when work wife told him about her tough childhood and how she was bullied throughout school. How she suffered and contemplated suicide.My husband said that he felt like he got his cousin back. Work wife knew that my husband was married (newly wed actually) and it didn't seem to be a problem for her in the beginning. He admitted that he sensed that she was falling for him very soon but that he never really confronted her about it because he didn't want to hurt her feelings. When she saw me in a picture she got very angry with him and said that she was very disappointed in him. I looked the type that would bully people like her and my husband in high school. She was disappointed and asked him what he saw in me. He told her that he loved me but she was sour afterwards accusing him of being shallow. He asked her to give me a chance at the Christmas party.She didn't change her opinion however. He wasn't bothered that she disliked me because he thought that she was jealous. He knew that she was decided on not giving me a chance and that was fine with him.  He thought that this will be one of the things they will have to disagree on.He is still adamant that he never kissed her back and he is adamant about getting the recording of that party. He said he pushed her and after the party, he had a fight with her about boundaries and confronted her about her feelings. He told her that they could no longer be friends now that she had crossed the line. We went on a 5w vacation the day after that party and he said that if I read the texts from that time I would find that she had apologized several times asking for forgiveness, begging him not to ditch her as a friend.After summer their relationship was strained but they eventually became closer again. He said he doesn't know why he felt like she needed him in her life like she needed his protection. He always thought about being put in harm's way and he couldn't stand the thought. He swore it was never romantic or sexual. He admitted that he love her like a friend or like if his cousin was still around.He told me that he has handed in his resignation and will be seeking new jobs. He's realized that he has to let work wife go. He admitted that he even now is worried about her. She is losing both her BF and him, but that he needs to remind himself that she is a grown up woman and not his 16 years old cousin. She'll be fine. And about my fears that he  loves me for how I look, he said that he is sorry if he ever made me feel that way and that it is far from the truth. When he think about us, he sees us growing old together and that prospect fills his heart with more love and joy. Comment from OOP:i saw the recording too, he does back off and looked angry and left and she ran after him. He said he wanted to apologize Reminder - I am not the original poster.",4 months ago,10.4k,755 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/ylbqgy/i_dont_like_the_relationship_between_my_husband/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">I think my duo buddy might actually be an advanced A.I. chatbot made to play League</h1>",SubredditStories,"1. MEETING CHUCKOn the night I met Chuck, I'd just started my regular routine. Fingers cold from the A/C pumping, a fresh six-pack of beers within easy reach. Heart still thumping from the day’s regular anxiety while I get ready for a new form of anxiety called League of Legends.This was about six months ago. I’d been tearing up the jungles of NA’s low-diamond ranks as Teemo. A player we'll call ""Chuck"" was holding down top lane for our team as Nasus, just stacking away like a good boy.From the start, Chuck was a sort of overwhelming presence in chat. Just super fucking positive, articulating his plans, calling out wards, congratulating everybody for playing well. You know these guys. It’s like they’re trying to keep everybody in a good mood so nobody tilts and starts throwing. Maybe it’s a valid strategy. Myself -- I tend to keep quiet and focused on my own problems.Chuck stomped his lane and methodically blew down the towers up top first, then headed bot to stack some champs. Chuck was really having a blast in chat, and so was everybody else on the team. As we closed in on the enemy nexus, Chuck typed in /all chat something along the lines of “You guys were great opponents. Thank you so much for the game! I respect all of you.”Sort of obnoxious, but also a little disarmingly charming.In the post-game lobby one guy from the other team advised Chuck to cause himself bodily harm using a dildo. But two others thanked him for being an honorable opponent (bring that button back rito pls).Anyway, after the game Chuck shot me a friend request, and, on a whim, I accepted. Few of my IRL friends actually play League anymore, and I usually don’t play with randos. But Chuck seemed like a big-dick top laner and I’m a sucker for freelo. Plus he had positive energy, and frankly I needed more of that in my life -- like most competitive gamers I both love and hate my hobby at the same time.So anyway, I accepted Chuck’s friend request and we started chatting. Right away, I was getting weird vibes from this guy. He was just… so… happy? That it was actually weird.CHATLOG1 - https://i.imgur.com/MVpgzLU.png (note: I've edited the image to hide Chuck's real in-game name and the names of unrelated folks on my friends list)See what I mean? Dude’s communication style is like some perfectly grammatical Strunk & White shit. And he was so juiced to be playing League, like it was season one again or something.2. A STRANGE DUONonetheless, we started playing together pretty regularly. We won some and lost some, but Chuck never once turned negative (Chuck refused to use voice chat, so we stuck to text). He was always just trying to uplift people on our team, and even those on the other team. Plenty of players at this elo do nasty shit to try to tilt their lane opponents—a tilted enemy is a more easily-beaten enemy, after all—but many times I saw Chuck go out of his way to share a kind or uplifting word with opponents who were showing signs of stress.Mostly I was starting to feel confused about the whole situation. I wasn't just that Chuck was overwhelmingly happy about playing League. It was more that he seemed permanently determined to get me to play more, too.Like this:CHATLOG2 - https://i.imgur.com/iI95dx8.pngAt first, I convinced myself that this type of shit was normal. I mean, our whole relationship was based around League. So it sort of made sense that every conversation was just about playing more League.But then I checked his match history. That's when I started to get pretty weirded out.Chuck was playing for 16 hours a day, every single day. Weekdays, weekends, holidays, you name it. The dude did not take breaks, except for roughly eight hours every night from 2am until 10am the next morning.It struck me that even though Chuck always seemed happy, something must be seriously wrong with him. I mean, I’ve known plenty of people who use games as an escape from reality, and I think “gaming addiction disorder” or whatever they’re calling it now is total bullshit. (When people who get depressed and spend all day in bed, you wouldn’t call that “bed addiction disorder,” right?) But when you’re playing games that much, it’s still probably a sign that something in your life is going haywire.I struggled to decide whether I should confront Chuck about his behavior. Every time I'd log in, I'd quickly get those bronze-gold alerts tugging at me from a corner of the screen -- Chuck wanting to get in some games. But I didn't know how to talk about it, or what I'd say. After all, it's not like I could explain why I put so many hours into online games. So why demand an explanation from Chuck about his habits?After about a week of this, I permanently lost my chance to bring it up. Chuck disappeared.But before he did, he left me a very strange message.3. SHIT GETS WEIRDI'd logged in just to check out a new skin sale, and got a notification right away. Chuck was online, so I thought I had a pretty clear idea of what he wanted. I wasn't in the mood, so I went to the kitchen to heat up some leftovers and grab a drink.When I came back, I popped open my chat window and saw something extremely disturbing.CHATLOG3, PART 1 - https://i.imgur.com/FhjxNhd.pngCHATLOG3, PART 2 - https://i.imgur.com/qpTb6Nn.pngChuck hasn't been online since he sent those messages, and his match history stopped updating. The whole text explosion thing at the end seemed beyond weird too.So like… what the fuck, right?I've sat on this story for a few weeks, not actually knowing what to do with it. Is Chuck just some guy trolling me? It doesn't seem possible, because we played together for months on end and he only ever seemed capable of happiness and kindness. Honestly, when I think about all my interactions with him, it occurs to me that Chuck always seemed a little… robotic.It's that word -- robotic -- that now I can't get out of my head whenever I think about Chuck. The insane gaming hours, the super carefully-formulated writing style, the single-mindedness about playing more League (and always, ALWAYS loving it, even in situations where anybody would get pissed).I'm almost totally convinced now that Chuck wasn't actually human. I think he was one of those super advanced artificially intelligent bots, like the one that got really good at Dota 2. But… also like some kind of super-advanced chat bot at the same time.I know this all sounds pretty far fetched, but that's why I'm making this post. I can't think of any other explanation, and I hope some of you can.",5 years ago,9.2k,524 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8yx35x/i_think_my_duo_buddy_might_actually_be_an/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">DD: Statistical analysis of trading data from GME shows that the outstanding shares are inflated by a factor of 10. SHORTS DID NOT COVER!</h1>",sdfprwggv,"Disclaimer: All data shown here is publicly available and can be downloaded and evaluated with the scripts I provide. Please read my previous posts for this. I do not claim the correctness of the data and the source code, everyone is invited to review, repeat and improve the analysis.GME is a highly volatile stock:As a measure of volatile, the one minute candles between 03/13/2022 and 04/13/2022 were evaluated. For this purpose, the standard deviation of the percentage change per minute was calculated and compared with all Russel 1000 tickers.Std. of the percentual candle = standard deviation( (close - open)/open )The following graph shows the results against the market cap.The volatility is driven by trading volume:The volatility can be driven by various factors, but if you take a look at the trading volume, it quickly becomes clear that it plays a decisive role.As a measure of trading volume, the number of shares traded per minute is multiplied by the opening price and normalized to the market cap.mean percentage volume dollar = mean( volume * open ) / market capCan retail generate this volume?Short answer: NoLong answer: Retail would have to keep selling each other shares to generate 0.42% of the market cap per minute. To generate such a high trading volume per minute you need both the financial resources and the infrastructure. Retail would quickly run out of money just because of the transaction fees and the spread, not to mention that trading algorithms with the necessary performance and infrastructure are needed.In addition, retail is clearly a value investor at GME, which is clear from the published DRS figures, for example. In addition, the published data from fidelity show that retail buys both dip and rip. As the following graph illustrates. Data from the wayback archive was analyzed. Each point represents a saved status since 01.01.2021.Conclusion: MM, HF, Banks are driving the volume and thereby the volatility. They manipulate the price.How is the price manipulated?It is not possible for Retail to provide direct evidence of manipulation as Retail does not have access to the necessary data. The process is not transparent. Therefore, retail has to rely on indirect indicators. An indirect indicator is the correlation between occurring gaps in one minute candles and the outstanding shares. The following graph illustrates this relationship for all Russel 1000 tickers.The proportion of gaps in one minute candles is obviously much too small for the outstanding shares. Note the log scale. Here one can conclude that GME is traded as if it had approx. 10x outstanding shares.Put simply: If we did not know the outstanding shares and someone gave us this graph and the proportion of gaps for GME, where would we place GME?Challenge for Artificial Intelligence Experts:load trading data from all Russel 1000 tickers.train AI on 500 randomly selected tickers (exclusive GME) to estimate the outstanding shares based on the trade data.calculate the accuracy of the model on the remaining 500 tickers (excl. GME)determine the outstanding shares for GMErepeat the procedure to test the robustness of the modelConclusion: MM, HF, banks create artificial liquidity by their market power in a legeal or illegal way (retail has no/little possibility to check it). The statistical analysis of GME clearly shows the deviations compared to other Russel 1000 tickers and proves that only MM, HF, banks have enough financial means and infrastructure to implement this. This manipulation is created by the artificial increase of the outstanding shares by a factor of approx. 10x.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Why Humans Avoid War IV</h1>",SpacePaladin15,"First | Prev | Next---Kilon POVThe Devourers did not look so fearsome in person. They were short, stocky bipeds who seemed like nothing out of the ordinary compared to most Federation races. Their height would only put them up at about the average human’s shoulders, and their skin was a pale lavender hue. I had no doubt that the lean, muscled Terran soldiers could toss them around if they wanted to.Had the boarding party taken the enemy ship just a few minutes later, we would have been left empty-handed. As it were, the humans had only been able to revive one of the two occupants. Our prisoner was then transported back to the flagship and moved to the medical wing, where he was restored to stable condition. He was kept restrained and would be guarded round-the-clock by watchful sentries.I tagged along with Commander Rykov as he headed toward medbay. It would be interesting to witness human interrogation tactics. After seeing the cruel pleasure in their eyes during battle, I wondered if they would torture the prisoner for information. It certainly was within the realm of possibility.An assistant handed the Commander a cup filled with steaming brown liquid as we walked. When I inquired as to what it was, he explained that it was called “coffee” and was a mild stimulant. I simply nodded, not wanting to offend my host. Internally, however, I thought it was in extremely poor taste for an officer to be consuming drugs on duty. It was a bad example to set for his subordinates.The prisoner was just stirring as we arrived at our destination. He looked a bit disoriented, but oddly enough, he was not struggling against the restraints. A laptop was stationed by his bedside, with an audio capture running on screen.“Will our translation software work?” I whispered to Rykov.The human shrugged in response. “It should. Our program has gone over all their transmissions that we have on record, and hopefully it was able to decipher their language from that.”The enemy captive spoke a few syllables of gibberish, and the computer piped up in Galactic Common a second later. The two words chilled me to the bone. It said, “Help us.”Commander Rykov blinked in confusion. “Help you? Okay, back up. First off, what is your name and rank?”There was a pause as the computer translated the question, and then another as it processed the response. “My name is Byem. I do not know what this ‘rank’ is you speak of.”“You don’t have some sort of hierarchy?” I asked.“The Master is in charge of all. We obey or suffer the consequences. There is no escape.”Rykov took a tentative step forward. “Who is the Master? Why did you attack us?”The prisoner emitted a strange vibration, which the computer identified as laughter. “The more accurate question is what is the Master. I see now that you know nothing. I just assumed people with your technology would be aware of our history.We were once a great species. When I was young, I remember being in awe of the technology we invented. I can say with confidence that we were the greatest builders in our galaxy. The irony is that it was our craftiness that destroyed us.We created an artificial intelligence, with a single directive. It was to create a world without scarcity. It was given authority to govern our resources and power our cities. We thought we could create a utopia. Ending all want, labor, and suffering; it was too good to be true.The machine pondered the problem. We assumed it would create some grand new form of energy, or that it would optimize asteroid mining. But it found a different solution. The only way to avoid scarcity was to control all of the resources in the universe. It would take them by force and use us as its army.”Trying to picture the Devourers as a peaceful species of inventors was difficult. For years, Federation Intelligence had watched them destroy any species that dared to defend their home planet. They encircled stars with absorptive panels and plundered planets, without a second thought for the lifeforms they rendered extinct.We were told that the enemy could not be reasoned with, and that their greed was unparalleled. But if what Byem said was true, then they were unwilling participants the entire time. Their mindless, mechanical behavior made much more sense if they were under the direction of a rogue AI.I believed his story; the question was whether Rykov did. The revelation might steer the Terran Union away from the genocide route, but the Commander needed to be the one to relay the message. I doubted the humans would believe any information that came from us.Commander Rykov sipped at his coffee, taking a moment to process what had been said. “Why wouldn’t anyone fight back? Or try to destroy it?”“Of course people did. But they’re all dead now. The Master had overridden its emergency shutdown function. None of our safeguards worked. It controlled everything, military and industrial, so what was there to fight it with?Its only use for us is as a resource. If we defy it, if we fail, then we are no longer useful…and you see what happens. Once it takes control of everything, I have no doubt it will kill us all anyways, but that will take time. Compliance buys us a few more generations.As I said, there is no way out for us. It must finish its mission. It does not understand anything else.”“I see,” Commander Rykov muttered. “Answer me one more thing. Your weapons are also your inventions?”“No, our fleet was dreamed up by the Master. Its technology is beyond anything biologicals could conjure, or so we thought. What could be better at killing than a computer, after all?You are the first to defeat it, and you did so with ease. Perhaps I should fear you…but you are our only hope.”The Commander frowned. “Thank you for speaking with us, Byem. That will be all for now. General, please come with me back to the bridge.”I waited until we were out of earshot of the prisoner, then turned to Rykov. “What do you think?”“A troubling story,” the human replied. “I would be less inclined to believe him, if not for the suicide attempt. It doesn’t add up without an outside force. I need to share our findings with my government immediately. This changes everything.”“Will you advise them to call off the bombing?” I asked.Commander Rykov sighed. “I will. We have to at least try to help.”“But?”“But the only way to be sure we destroy that thing is to destroy everything on that planet. If we try to evacuate the people, it will just kill them. If we do nothing, it could study our technology and replicate it. Then we’re really screwed. I’m not sure we have a choice, General.”The Commander’s words made sense, as much as I hated to hear them. We couldn’t risk Terran weaponry falling into a murderous AI’s possession. Someone needed to devise a solid plan in short order, before the time to act had passed.There was something else that bothered me though. It was a point that Byem had mentioned, one that lingered in my mind. The fact that the Terrans had created better tools for warfare than a computer, a machine with the raw power of calculation on its side.It spoke volumes about their species, and how naturally killing came to humanity. I felt that I should be more wary, yet I could not help but be charmed by them. For some reason, my gut instinct was that they could be trusted.Perhaps we should fear the humans, but at this point, they were the galaxy’s only hope.---First | Prev | NextSupport my writing on Patreon, if you're enjoying the story!",2 years ago,8.3k,207 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/m3sttr/why_humans_avoid_war_iv/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Why Humans Avoid War VI</h1>",SpacePaladin15,"First | Prev | Next---Byem POVSometimes, I wondered why it needed us. Machines fared much better at manual labor anyways. My best guess was there was a limit to how many tasks it could concentrate on at once.Yet again, I found myself hating the Master, loathing my existence. A fog of exhaustion pressed down on me as always; it had been days since I last slept. A part of me wanted to curl up onto the ground and let it all fade to black. To have peace at last.My breath came in ragged gasps, and sweat beaded on my forehead. The insulation of the vac suit kept the frigid cold of the ice planet out, but it kept my own heat expenditures in as well.I glanced over at my son, Kel, who was helping me push a tub of iron ore toward the mining tunnel’s lift. I could fight through the pain and the weariness for him. The poor boy, born into an unforgiving world, to know nothing but servitude. He needed his father around, if only to feel a touch of love and warmth.A strange sense of déjà vu gripped my mind a moment before it happened. Without warning, the ground shook beneath my feet, and stalactites started to rain from above. It must have been some sort of tectonic activity. Most planets did not experience the phenomenon, but we knew for the ones that did, it could wreak havoc on artificial structures. We had to leave the mine now, before we were buried alive.A scream echoed from further down the tunnel, pleading for help. I recognized the voice of Kel’s girlfriend, words laced with pain. My son turned in the direction of her call, and I could picture the worry creasing his face through the opaque helmet.“Dad? I’ll be right back, you go on.” Kel dashed off, before I could make an attempt to stop him.Terror coursed through my veins. “Kel? Kel!”I distantly felt a hand grip my shoulder, and the mine dissolved into darkness. My eyes blinked open, back on the strange ship. The pale creature, who called himself “Rykov”, was standing over me. His expression seemed concerned.I rubbed the sore spot behind my ear, where they had injected me with a language implant. The ridges of a thin scar pressed against my fingers. It served as confirmation that the events of the past day were real, and not some fevered dream.“Are you okay?” Rykov asked. “You were talking in your sleep, and you sounded upset.”I sighed, images of my son still flitting through my mind. “I’m fine. It was just a bad dream.”He nodded, pausing for a moment. “Who is Kel?”“Kel…” I closed my eyes, trying not to cry. “He’s my son. He’s dead.”“I’m sorry. I know what that’s like.” He grimaced, as though in pain. “It’s the worst thing a parent can ever go through.”“You lost a child?”“Yes. My youngest daughter, Alina. She was only three when the cancer took her. It’s an awful disease that turns your own body against you. She fought so hard, through so much pain. We did everything we could, but none of the treatments did a damned thing. I know she would have had so much to offer the world, if only she had the chance.”“I’m sorry, Rykov. So young…” A tear trickled down my cheek. “Kel was my only son. There was an earthquake, and our mines were collapsing. He ran back in to save his girlfriend. Maybe if I had gone with him, it would have played out differently, but I fled like a coward. He never made it out. What kind of a father am I?”His frown deepened. “You can’t blame yourself, Byem. I’ve fallen into that trap myself. It’s not your fault. Sometimes, there’s just nothing you can do.”I heard a jingling sound, and felt his hands lock firmly around my left wrist. I watched as he inserted a pin into the manacle, and with a click, the band came unclasped. The skin where the restraint had been was chafed, a dark violet hue lingering in its place.Rykov freed my right arm as well, then took a few wary steps back. His eyes didn’t leave me for a moment. I also noticed his hand hovering above his hip, where he appeared to have a gun tucked away. Did he think I was going to lunge at him, like some kind of wild animal? Our interactions must not have eased all of his suspicions.I stretched with slow, deliberate motions, then rose to my feet. It was unclear why I had been unbound, but there had to be something that they wanted of me.Rykov stared for a few moments longer, then relaxed his posture slightly. “Follow me.”It was a short walk to our destination, a hangar bay lined with sleek cruisers. A few workers were inspecting the condition of the craft and performing repairs, but most of the personnel milled about without assignment. The sounds of chatter and laughter buzzed in the air. The cheery atmosphere was alien to me; my people hadn’t possessed such spirit in decades.The crew members hushed up as they noticed our entry, and all eyes turned toward me. A flurry of whispers rippled across the room. I ducked my head, anxiety bubbling in my chest. It was likely that some of them harbored negative feelings toward my species, so I doubted how much my presence was welcome here.“Alright, I want all of you to listen in!” Rykov shouted. “I’m about to make a call to General Kilon, and we’ll be going over the details of the mission.”He removed a holopad from his pocket, and thumbed through a few screens. I watched over his shoulder as the three-eyed being from my first interrogation appeared.“Hello, Commander,” the General said. “The stealth ships should have arrived, as you requested.”Rykov gestured behind him. “Yes, we have them right here, thank you. I’m not sure how you convinced the Speaker.”“Years of practice.” The words were punctuated with smug satisfaction. “She isn’t wrong that you’re spying on us though. Care to explain that one?”The Commander shifted awkwardly. “We, um, sort of spy on everyone. The Federation has never been…particularly forthcoming with us. Anyhow, did you get the plan I sent over?”“Yes, and I only have one question.” General Kilon sighed, an exasperated look on his face. “Are all of your ideas this insane?”“What? I don’t see the issue with it. Are you saying you have something better in mind?”“Well, no.”“It’s drawn up based on the intelligence Byem gave us. We have a rough layout of the planet now. There’s twelve main settlements, and the rest of the populace is deployed off-world. We’re going to evacuate the largest one today. Our fighters will engage the AI’s forces in orbit, keep it distracted, while the stealth ships sneak down to rescue the people. That makes sense, yes?”“It does, but that wasn’t the entire plan, Commander. You left a few things out. Like letting Byem fly a stealth ship, the impossible time constraints…oh yeah, and the part about the anti-matter bombs.”My eyes widened as I realized what General Kilon had said. Their strategy involved me as a pilot? After years of conscription, the last thing I wanted was to dive right back into the war.Rykov shrugged. “There are mechanical sentries posted all over the city, surveilling the people. Humans walking around would be noticed, but Byem won’t stand out. If we just immediately knock out the sentries and try to evacuate the civilians, they might see us as a threat and fight. We need Byem to convince them to come with us.”“And you really think you can complete this all in forty minutes?”“The AI will kill the people if it suspects it’s losing. As you and I saw, it doesn’t allow the possibility of capture. So destroying all of its forces and stockpiles is off the table, it’s more about buying time. We’ll give Byem twenty minutes on the ground, then we’ll take out the sentries. We have about another twenty minutes before the security drones arrive, and it has to be done by then.”“Okay, well how about…”“The anti-matter bombs? The AI can’t realize the people escaped. If we turn the entire city to ash, hopefully it thinks they’re all dead.”“There is so much that could go wrong with this. Everything has to be perfect."" The General hesitated. “You’ll have my support, Commander, but don’t make me regret it. I’ll speak with you after the mission.”I cast a blank stare at the floor as the call was terminated. My name was mentioned in their plans far too much for my liking. I wanted no part in the risk, the danger of it all. Could I really convince an entire settlement to leave with alien soldiers, within their timeframe, anyways?Rykov glanced at me, smiling confidently. “Well, you heard all of that, Byem. What do you say? Are you ready to save the day?”A thousand reasons not to agree raced through my mind. There might be consequences for turning him down, but I knew I was no hero. They could toss me into a cell and throw away the key for all I cared; it was preferable to going home. All I had to do was utter an adamant refusal.But instead, the words that slipped out of my mouth were, “Count me in.”---First | Prev | NextSupport my writing on Patreon, if you're enjoying the story!",2 years ago,7.5k,81 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ma1y9e/why_humans_avoid_war_vi/
"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">If you are skeptical about a blockchain exchange actually replacing the current stock market...</h1>",Arkayb33,"Remember that the entire stock market is owned and operated by private businesses. The NYSE, NASDAQ, DTC, Cede Co, IEX...all private (non-government) companies. Hell, even the Federal Reserve has just about as much to do with the Federal Government as Fed(eral) Express. The only relationship between the stock market and the government is the SEC, which is doing a terrible job simply because they don't understand the stock market as well as the owner/operators do.Netflix didn't have to ask for Blockbuster's permission to start its movie rental company.Tesla didn't have to ask Ford, GM, Honda, Toyota for permission to build and sell cars.Google didn't have to ask Yahoo!'s permission to create a search engine.Youtube didn't have to ask RealPlayer or Quicktime if they could make a video streaming service.Likewise, GameStop, Loopring, RC, whoever, doesn't have to ask the NYSE, DTC, or Citadel for permission to create a decentralized exchange build on the blockchain. They can just do it, and, if their offering better meets the needs/wants of their target market, clients will move over to the new system.Upsetting entire industries happens on a pretty regular basis, and it doesn't even have to be based on revolutionary new technology. Netflix used one of the oldest institutions in America to kick off its business: the post office. Yes, quite literally, Netflix started from some dude in his garage, sending DVDs through the mail. But when a revolutionary technology is used, the impact is heavy and far reaching (think Tesla). Electric cars will own the vast majority of future marketshare for a number of different reasons (cleaner, cheaper to maintain, easier to manufacture, etc), but most prominently (IMO) because it just makes sense to stop burning fossil fuels as a personal energy source (ICE engines are dirty, expensive, and incredibly inefficient; something like 90% of the energy is lost as heat).We have reached this point in history where it just makes sense to move to a new model for the exchange. While DEX and CEX will run in tandem for a while (just like electric and gasoline vehicles are running in tandem), DEX is clearly the future because of the inherent weaknesses of a CEX. GameStop is just the company that saw the opportunity and grabbed it by the throat. ANY company could have done this. Facebook could have done it, Amazon could have done it, RadioShack could have done it. But Zuck and Bozos were too busy being scumbags to think 45 seconds into the future. It would have made tons of sense for the DTC to pull its head out of its ass and build a DEX 5-10 years ago (or at least include, I dunno, serial tags on all digital certificates), but they were too busy giving handjobs to congress, thinking the gravy train will never run out of fuel.ANY company could have done this. But GameStop and RC (and several key partners) was the one to do it, simple as that. The juggernauts who have been running this ponzi scheme for well over 200 years know this will be their demise and now they're scared. We have them by the balls. We are making history.It will be amazing to tell your grandkids that you helped create the platform to buy and sell stocks (and movies, and music, and games, and pretty much everything else digital).Edit: this is getting some traction, let me address one other point real quick.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Through the Eye of the Needle</h1>",bott99,"The universe is a big place. Insanely big, really. We all know it, intellectually at least, if perhaps not with the same bone-deep certainty with which we know those things that we can see, touch or observe directly. The experts tell us that the universe is big, and so, like rational sophonts, we nod vigorously and say “I understand”, even though the concept of a million miles is too big for us to truly comprehend, let alone a million lightyears.Those same experts, at least those who adopt a cautious measure of conservatism, then compound the problem by telling us that the universe has a built-in speed limit: the speed of light. If this most ethereal of energies, unbound by the trappings of solidity, cannot pierce the heavens in a mortal lifetime then what hope have we, sheathed as we are by the constraints of flesh and mass? None, and so we are trapped, doomed to rot in the prison of physics, cruel in its indifference.It therefore makes sense that when an intelligent species is faced with distances so great that a lifetime of travel at conventional speeds, even a thousand lifetimes, barely gets you out of your own stellar neighbourhood, then that species will inevitably go looking for shortcuts. Those depressing certainties, which we so begrudgingly acknowledged previously, will inevitably become infected by the pathogen of doubt, and that more dangerous contagion, hope. Once that infection has taken root the death of certainty is sure to follow, and great things may become possible, despite any weight of evidence to the contrary.It was with this hope burrowing its way into our minds that a small number of us started Project Echo. If light would not move fast enough under its own power, then we would crack the whip of science until it did. We would give it no other option than to haul us to the stars.We fed our luminous beast of burden, splitting and bending light before feeding it back into itself in strange harmonics that shook the very fabric of spacetime. With each failure our hope grew, for the screams of our obstinate continuum grew ever more desperate as we pried away its secrets one by one, until the day that certainty lay dead. We saw the dawn of the new smaller universe our hope had promised. We had broken light in spirit, if not yet in body.We had achieved faster than light communication.Project Echo had managed to circumvent reality at the most incorporeal level. Information. We soon learned how to send and receive messages instantaneously. Initially just single bits, then bytes, then an endless flood of ones and zeros that spewed across this new spectrum. It showed us that the prison door was open, if only just ajar, and that soon we would step across the threshold and punch the warden of physics squarely in his jeering face.Our work continued. Project Echo was taken over by the world government and nationalised. We had more resources than ever before. More money, more minds, more hope. The light-beast quailed once more under the onslaught of our instruments, the new implements of torture we had devised.But we could not break its body, try as we might. We had mastered FTL communication, which had spread like wildfire to all corners of our society, but FTL transportation still eluded us. No matter how much energy we fed into the spacetime continuum we couldn’t tear a hole big enough that would allow anything physical to pass through. Our hope gradually diminished as the prison door slammed shut once again, the warden taunting us from behind the safety of the bars, unhurt and unconcerned.Still we toiled, unwilling to let the corpse of certainty rise from the grave to shackle us once more. For decades we pumped colossal energies into the hidden spaces of the void and listened intently to its squealing cries.Until one day, something happened.We heard voices, or at least the noises of intelligence. A fellow prisoner knocking on the other side of the walls of infinity. What else could we do but knock back?Eventually the knocking turned into sounds, foreign words whispered to each other when the warden wasn’t looking. We built a lexicon and learned to understand each other, and a flood of information began crashing back and forth.Our fellow prisoners were a race known as Humanity, located far beyond our own galaxy, in one they called the Milky Way. Like us they had tried to tame light to enable FTL transportation. Like us they had failed. But although it seemed that our peoples would never be able to meet face to face, we came to know each other anyway.Light carried our missives through the secret pathways we had forged. Pictures and sounds, then video and eventually pure data, encoded in agreed formats that we both could understand. We swapped our science and technology, we swapped our arts and history, and we swapped our hopes and dreams. We saw the beauty of Humanity and came to love them as our cosmic siblings. Our two peoples clung to each other like lifebuoys in a sea of emptiness, alone together.Imagine our surprise when strange new ships appeared, as if from nowhere, on the outskirts of our solar system. Gargantuan in size, they drifted silently inward, overlooking or ignoring our attempts to hail them. Had they tamed the beast and mastered FTL transport, or were they sailors, plying the interstellar seas like the Human mariners of old? We had to know.We could not bear to simply wait for their slow approach, so our outer colonies sent their fastest ships to intercept and greet the newcomers, who were still on the system’s distant fringes. It was farther than any of our crewed missions had ever travelled before. Hasty ship modifications were made to extend their range, at the expense of cargo and safety. The crews were selected from our best and brightest, those with the requisite bravery and fortitude.As our ships approached the mystery fleet, they began to broadcast a greeting using every spectrum we knew of. Our experience communicating with the Humans had taught us much about first contact, and we used it all again.“Hello” we said. “Your arrival brings us great joy. Welcome to our home.”We received only silence in response.More ships were sent when the first returned home to resupply. All were left ignored, hovering in front of our gargantuan visitors like mere insects.Months later the leading vessel of the visitor’s fleet neared our outmost colony, which clung to the moon of a cold gas giant, eking out a living mining ice and crude organic compounds. The colony broadcast the same greeting our previous envoys had sent. This time there was a response.Ruby fire erupted from the nearest visitor, a laser that cut the small colony in half. When the last wisps of its atmosphere had vented into the vacuum of space, the visitor launched ships that swarmed the colony, taking it apart piece by piece. The last transmissions we received spoke of black chitinous monsters storming through the airless corridors, snatching bodies of both the living and the dead.Their task seemingly completed, the visitors moved on, to slowly creep deeper into our system and the spoils that lay there. Sailing towards us.We mobilised our forces, which were minimal at best. We had not fought a war in centuries, and the hereto enduring silence of our local galaxy had left us passive and unconcerned with military matters. The fleets we sent to defend our colonies were quickly broken by the visitors, who cruised on indifferently, destroying outposts and harvesting our citizens with impunity.We screamed for help across the void, and the Humans gave us all they could. Designs for ships and weapons streamed constantly across the supra-light connection, as well as new techniques for manufacturing and logistics, as quick as they could be developed. The Human scientists worked tirelessly to advance our military technology, analysing the records of our failed engagements with the enemy. Our manufacturing base increased ten-fold, but it was not enough. Our adversary’s ships were tough, heavy hitters whose weapons could cleave through our best capital ships and destroy a hundred fighters in an instant. Our crews died in droves, an uneven trade for the few enemies they were able to destroy.With surrender impossible we began to contemplate evacuation, but it was only a fantasy. There were simply too many of us and no interstellar ships to carry us. All that evacuation could accomplish was slow deaths of starvation and asphyxiation, adrift in hostile space.We asked the Humans to remember us fondly when we were gone.“We will not forget” they replied.But there was more.“We will not forget a brother in trouble, or a sister in peril. We will not forget an enemy’s slight or a villain’s betrayal. We will not look up to the stars and know that our family died there, alone and afraid, in the wretched claws of evil. We will pass through the eye of a needle before we ever forget a friend in need.”Then it came. New data, new designs. Fantastic machinery, nanoscopic in scale, so complicated and intricate that we could not believe that such a thing was even possible. There were instructions on how to build it, and how to power it. We focused all our energies into its construction, hoping that the enemy’s advance would remain slow and give us the time we needed. We lived in constant fear that, with the end in sight, they would lunge forward for the final killing blow.The result of our labours was a cube, no bigger than a hand’s width. It was to be the first of many. The instructions dictated that we place these cubes on large stockpiles of raw matter. We placed it on a small planetoid, a failed moon that had never fully coalesced, dense with minerals.The cube came apart into a thousand glittering shards that soaked into the rock. The asteroid seemed to melt where the shards touched it, the new rivulets of material flowing together into a silver pool. From this pool a structure rose, skeletal, like the frame of some predatory nightmare from ancient times. Metal flesh flowed around it and the artificial creature grew. When its form looked complete it came to life, striding out of the liquid metal with jerky motions, up on to clear ground. In its place a new skeleton began to take shape.The first construct halted, standing motionless for several minutes. Our sensors showed it radiating heat as unseen processes continued to shape its interior. Then we detected a supra-light connection, reaching out across the universe, back to the Milky Way. Massive amounts of data streamed across it over the next hour, before trailing off to nothing.Lights came to life and the thing seemed to shudder. Limbs stretched out to full extension and cycled through their range of motion. Gone was the jerkiness that the thing had shown in its first movements, replaced by the sinuous grace of something almost biological. When the motions finished the machine strode toward our observation post, walking on two legs with surprising agility over the rough terrain of the asteroid.As it drew near to the observation post it issued forth a voice.“Hello” it said. “I’m Colonel Ari Hill. Terran Navy, First Regiment.”Behind it stretched an ever-growing line of copies, crawling their way out of the silver pool, which had now swelled to many times its original size as the cube’s nanotech chewed its way through the asteroid’s crust. The frames of larger constructs grew from it at several points, resembling the superstructure of spacecraft.“We’ve come to help” the Colonel said.Behind him his soldiers formed ranks. Old minds in new bodies.Hundreds of thousands of humans had volunteered to shed their mortal forms and digitize their minds, so that they could be squeezed through the interstices of spacetime, a space smaller than the eye of any needle.  They would then be downloaded into artificial bodies. Bodies built for war.They could not go back, except into more synthetic flesh. Their original bodies were gone. They had sacrificed their humanity by exercising its greatest virtues. Empathy. Compassion. Courage. They had chosen to stand with us, come what may.They will fight by our side. The dark certainty of death is once more infected by hope, delivered to us through the auspices of light. With them we are whole, and hopefully that will be enough.I think it will.",3 years ago,7.1k,212 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dv1p5q/through_the_eye_of_the_needle/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Radio Silence</h1>",bencbartlett,"36,400,000.  That is the expected number of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, according to Drake’s famous equation.  For the last 78 years, we had been broadcasting everything about us – our radio, our television, our history, our greatest discoveries – to the rest of the galaxy. We had been shouting our existence at the top of our lungs to the rest of the universe, wondering if we were alone. 36 million civilizations, yet in almost a century of listening, we hadn’t heard a thing.  We were alone.That was, until about 5 minutes ago.The transmission came on every transcendental multiple of hydrogen’s frequency that we were listening to.  Transcendental harmonics – things like hydrogen’s frequency times pi – don’t appear in nature, so I knew it had to be artificial.  The signal pulsed on and off very quickly with incredibly uniform amplitudes; my initial reaction was that this was some sort of binary transmission.  I measured 1679 pulses in the one minute that the transmission was active.  After that, the silence resumed.The numbers didn’t make any sense at first.  They just seemed to be a random jumble of noise.  But the pulses were so perfectly uniform, and on a frequency that was always so silent; they had to come from an artificial source.  I looked over the transmission again, and my heart skipped a beat.  1679 – that was the exact length of the Arecibo message sent out 40 years ago.  I excitedly started arranging the bits in the original 73x23 rectangle.  I didn’t get more than halfway through before my hopes were confirmed.  This was the exact same message.  The numbers in binary, from 1 to 10.  The atomic numbers of the elements that make up life.  The formulas for our DNA nucleotides.  Someone had been listening to us, and wanted us to know they were there.Then it came to me – this original message was transmitted only 40 years ago.  This means that life must be at most 20 lightyears away. A civilization within talking distance? This would revolutionize every field I have ever worked in – astrophysics, astrobiology, astro-The signal is beeping again.This time, it is slow.  Deliberate, even.  It lasts just under 5 minutes, with a new bit coming in once per second.  Though the computers are of course recording it, I start writing them down. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0... I knew immediately this wasn’t the same message as before.  My mind races through the possibilities of what this could be.  The transmission ends, having transmitted 248 bits.  Surely this is too small for a meaningful message.  What great message to another civilization can you possibly send with only 248 bits of information?  On a computer, the only files that small would be limited to…Text.Was it possible? Were they really sending a message to us in our own language?  Come to think of it, it’s not that out of the question – we had been transmitting pretty much every language on earth for the last 70 years…  I begin to decipher with the first encoding scheme I could think of – ASCII.  0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.  That’s B... 0. 1. 1 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. E…As I finish piecing together the message, my stomach sinks like an anchor.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Stay Away from Earth</h1>",SpacePaladin15,"Next---There always seemed to be mysterious accidents in Terran space. Ships would go missing without a trace, or would be damaged by seemingly nothing. The in-flight data recorders never showed a hint of anything on sensors. It was quite a strange phenomenon.The few witnesses that made it back alive told increasingly fantastical tales. In Laihar mythos, there existed guardian spirits. Ghosts who died unjustly and chose to stay behind to protect the innocent. They were said to be vicious in their righteous anger, and of course, invisible to living. The survivors spread rumors that the Sol system was haunted by these spirits, who would decimate any evildoers who dared to approach Earth.A few recurring elements often popped up in such stories. Claims of seeing a slight shimmer in the void of space or hearing an angry human voice over the communications systems were common. Their ship would then be either torn apart from all directions, or incapacitated and boarded by shadowy figures.At first, the legends did not convince many people. The word of criminals and peasants was not exactly reliable, especially when they were making far-fetched claims. That all changed when our government sent three military reconnaissance ships to scout out a potential conquest of Earth. And they just vanished.Word leaked out to the press of the failed operation, and suddenly, those ghost stories had a lot more credibility among spacefarers. Smugglers, merchants and slave transports alike began to avoid the Sol system, for fear that they too would disappear. Taking a longer route increased expenditure on fuel, but it beat being snatched up by the spirits.I was not one of the believers though. Ghosts didn’t exist and religion was a hoax, as far as I was concerned. These tales had to be exaggerated, little more than the results of trauma and overactive imaginations. After mulling it over, I guessed that the Terrans had set up some sort of mine field in their systems.I shared my hypothesis with the other generals. I suggested we proceed with the invasion, and simply deploy drones ahead of our fleet to activate any traps. After a brief discussion, they unanimously agreed to my plan and selected me to head the mission. It had been my idea, after all.Deployment meant some risk to my life, but I was confident the strategic advice I had given. If this worked out, I would be hailed as a hero throughout the Empire. Conquering an inhabited world was one of the greatest achievements a general could attain.Our fleet spread out into arc formation as we entered the Sol system, and all seemed to be going smoothly. I was on board the command vessel at the rear of the procession, relaying orders to the skirmishers. We unleashed a flurry of drones to lead the way, and sure enough, a series of explosions took them out. No vessels other than our own were in sight or on radar.That must mean I had been right about the mines! If we entered now, before they had time to re-activate them, surely the way would be clear.The thought that the ghost stories might be true briefly crossed my mind. The explosions that obliterated the drones had been oddly precise for pre-arranged traps. But I quickly chided myself for such foolishness. Ghosts were just superstition.I ordered the fleet onward. There was no sign of trouble, just an eerie silence. Something just felt off about this, and I wasn’t sure what it was.Suddenly, communications with the front line skirmishers were cut off. Our sensors detected an energy burst consistent with an electromagnetic pulse, seemingly originating from nowhere. Plasma bolts scorched our fighters from both flanks, disintegrating their hull plating and shielding. I could see the atmosphere venting from several now-crippled spacecraft on the viewport, but I could not see our attackers.“Shoot them!!” I barked at my weapons officer.“Shoot who?” he replied. “General, there’s no hostiles on the targeting system to engage.”Panic bubbled in my chest as I realized we had lost contact with the majority of our fleet in a matter of seconds. The most advanced war ships in the Imperial fleet had been picked off with such ease, by an invisible enemy. I couldn’t fathom how this was possible, but supernatural forces almost seemed the only plausible explanation.I turned to order a retreat, but a powerful blast jolted the command ship at that instant. The lights went out and the artificial gravity failed as the computer diverted all power to shields. I felt my feet float off the ground, and tried to latch onto the desk to hold myself down.Even at max defense output, the shields were barely holding. Mind you, this was the Empire’s flagship, designed to withstand the direct hit of a nuclear missile. The only thing that could penetrate our defenses would be sustained anti-matter torpedo fire. But anti-matter weapons were quite rare to find on the battlefield, as they were extremely difficult and expensive to manufacture. What species would devote so much money and resources to weaponry? It was impractical.Now spirits, on the other hand, had no such financial limitations. Perhaps they could even summon state-of-the-art ghost ships at will. It was all starting to add up; I didn’t think I could remain in denial much longer.The shields collapsed, and the latest anti-matter volley connected with the engine room. Our attackers had known exactly where to aim, taking out central power and our warp drive. Weapons, navigation, communications; all offline. Only basic functions such as life support remained online, powered by the emergency power generator.With shields no longer operational, the generator also trickled energy back to lighting and artificial gravity. I was already running when my feet slammed back onto the floor, calling out to abandon ship. There were escape pods in the hangar. Our vessel was doomed, but perhaps a few of us could jet away and signal for help. Or at least we could warn our command.Smoke seeped down from the upper decks as I dashed through a series of winding corridors and narrow stairwells. The evacuation route had not been well planned out; I doubted any of this ship's creators imagined it would ever be needed.Coughing, I stumbled into the hangar. A discordant grinding sound hummed in the air as I entered. Sparks were flying from the airlock, etching faint orange lines into the metal. It looked as though someone were trying to make an incision point for boarding. I shuddered to think who that someone would be.I took a few steps forward, beckoning for my men to follow. Perhaps if we hurried, we could get out before they got in. But any hopes I had of reaching the escape pods melted away as the airlock fell inward. There was no breaching tunnel to keep the ship pressurized, and yet we could still breathe. All I saw were stars and a strange shimmering effect, as though reality itself had been altered.Figures clad head to toe in black stepped through the breach. They seemed to materialize out of thin air, pointing their weapons at us. The sheer terror I felt nearly froze me in place, but somehow, I remembered how to move my limbs. I raised my arms high above my head, every muscle in my body trembling.“We surrender! Please, don’t hurt us!” I shouted.Well, I tried to shout at least. It came out as more of a whimper.The last thing I remember before I passed out was one of the shadowy beings approaching and pulling a bag over my head.---Colonel Daniel Kelly had stopped by for a progress report on the interrogation. A group of officers were watching through a one-way mirror as intelligence officers grilled the captive alien general. So far, they had picked up a lot of crucial information on the Laihar Empire’s military capabilities, tactics, and plans from him.It was strange how cooperative he was. He pleaded with human interrogators not to curse his soul on more than one occasion, promising he would tell them whatever they wanted to know. The groveling and the hysterics did not seem becoming of an officer of any army.“This sniveling guy is one of their highest-ranking generals?” Col. Kelly asked in a derisive tone. “Why in the hell is he acting like this?”Lieutenant Ross Schaffer smiled. “Well sir, apparently the xenos have no concept of stealth technology. Since our cloaked ships were invisible to them, they think they were attacked by ghosts.”“Seriously? In that case, we should send him back. If he tells his buddies about the ‘ghosts’, maybe they’ll call off the invasion.”The Colonel tapped on the glass twice to signal for the interrogators to exit the room. He stepped into the cell, eyeing the gray-skinned alien in his custody. The Laihar general cowered under his gaze.“Well, it looks like today is your lucky day. We’re going to send you home, on one condition,” Col. Kelly said.The alien looked at him earnestly. “I’ll do anything.”“We have a message for the Empire, and we want you to relay it. Tell them, in these exact words:Stay the fuck away from Earth.”",2 years ago,6.2k,85 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/lpmdjm/stay_away_from_earth/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">The Nature of Predators 17</h1>",SpacePaladin15,"First | Prev | Next---Memory transcription subject: Captain Sovlin, Federation Fleet CommandDate [standardized human time]: September 3, 2136Worst-case scenarios cycled through my mind, as the Gojid ships formed a defensive wall around the colony. I tried to imagine how the people on the ground felt; trapped and aware of the impending assault.This sea of dots spanning the blue orb’s circumference was all that stood between the innocent and hungry predators. Any angle that was overlooked was an opportunity for the humans to break through. We would stop any missiles from penetrating our ranks by throwing our craft in the way, if necessary.The only way a battle with a predator ended, was with all of them dead, or all of us dead.The primitive nature of the human craft was our primary hope. A single hit should be enough to dispatch their ships. Hell, the station’s lasers might be able to chew through more than one at a time. Our weaponry was designed to tear through Arxur armor, and the Terrans’ defenses were negligible.“Sir. The ships have reappeared just out of targeting range,” Jemic barked, a tremor in her voice. I hoped the weapons officer could keep her wits. “On a trajectory course for the base.”The viewport locked onto the hostiles. I watched as they veered off onto multiple headings, and altered their course to avoid any intercepting ships we launched. A laser lanced out from the station, a streak of brilliancy across the void. The shot connected with a Terran bomber, and obliterated the predator craft in a flash.Happiness fluttered in my chest, though it was tempered by nerves. It was encouraging that we had attained the first kill of the war.The humans, in response, spewed plasma at the approaching Gojid ships. They seemed to hope that would ward us off, like brandishing a torch to keep a beast at bay. Weapons of that caliber couldn’t deal more than minor damage, but I knew they had to preserve their main payload for their target.It occurred to me that we had simplified the task of bombing the station for the humans. The predators were flooring it toward their stated target, and in many ways, my suggestions cleared the path. There wasn’t a single sign of deviation, which boggled my mind.The asteroid base dispatched as many ships as it could, and left its own defenses barren in the process. When given the choice, our commanders prioritized civilian lives over military infrastructure.Things can be replaced. Stations can be rebuilt, I chided myself. Lives cannot. There are children down there.I couldn’t help but wonder, for a split second, if this was a lapse in judgment on my part. Where was that predatory sadism; the one Zarn said humans used on their own world? The last thing I wanted was to cost the Gojidi Union valuable resources. It was worse if some soldiers didn’t make it from their barracks. Their deaths would weigh on my conscience for years.But there was no way a predator could override their bloodlust, particularly while engaged in warfare! It was a matter of time before the humans rounded on our position. At least a few ships had to give into temptation, even if the majority could resist.“Shoot the bastards! Blast them out of the sky!” I roared.Jemic sighed. “I just said they’re out of range, sir. We need to move closer.”“We are NOT abandoning our position. The second the planet is vulnerable, they’ll pounce.”My mind yearned to fight the humans myself, but I had to remember the stakes at hand. We were consigned to watching, as though this skirmish were some spectator sport. Zarn was cheering each time a Terran vessel went up in a fireball, which earned strange glances from the nearest crew.The predators weaved erratic patterns to avoid termination, but their spirals and zigzags weren’t fast enough. Every crackle of the laser purged one of the vermin. The station’s defenses were slow to recharge, but their effectiveness was dazzling. In fairness, it seemed a love tap could take out a Terran ship; their workmanship was rather flimsy.Gojid craft remained hot on the humans’ heels, and spit our own concentrated plasma at them. There was no breathing space for our attackers. The predators rocketed up to max acceleration, and towed a tighter line toward the base. It was wonderful to see our ships chasing the humans; how the tables had turned, from the natural order. The hunter was the hunted.“Captain, the predators are showing no interest in the colony. I don’t see the harm in taking a few ships to the battlefield,” Jemic pressed.“They’re just trying to lose their pursuers. If they can bait us away from the colony’s defense, that’s what they want.”Her spines bristled. “I hate feeling powerless.”“As do I. Zarn, why don’t you make yourself useful?” I gestured toward the doctor, who was transfixed by the battle. “Establish contact with Piri, if at all possible. Make her aware of the predators’ tactics, so she can relay a warning to any nearby installations.”The Takkan returned an eager tail swish, and scrambled to reopen communication lines. My gaze darted back to the viewport. I looked just in time to catch a glimpse of a Terran fighter, taking a round to the belly. The plasma compromised its hull integrity, and reduced it to a fractured heap of metal.There was no hesitation from the Gojid chasers, to bombard the incapacitated ship with fire. Nobody would be foolish enough to leave a predator alive; they needed to be taken out of the fight with permanence. As long as such a monster was still kicking, they could have a final trick up their sleeves.The human vessels clustered back together, and opted to deal with the gaining pursuers one at a time. They peppered the closest Gojid ship with fire, and concentrated their strikes on its drive column. The patroller’s engine went up in a colossal flare; debris was flung in all directions. Our other allies were forced to drop back, to avoid getting swept up in the blast’s wake.Stars… I hate humans, I seethed. They don’t quit or retreat! I curse my ancestors, for not confirming their extinction centuries ago. This is going to be a tedious and costly war, even if we win.The predators had endured a hailstorm of fire, and pressed nearer to the base all the same. No matter how many of their brethren were reduced to scrap, they persevered. Watching the humans’ fearlessness, I couldn’t help but envy their natural disposition. They shrugged off losses with that callous disregard for life they were so famed for.We felt our casualties. That was the Federation’s downfall against the Arxur. It was emotion that lost us the war. Predators saw only the mission; the kill.“Captain, we have to do something,” Jemic growled.I flicked my ears. “It’s too late. They’re almost within orbital range.”While the Gojid defenses could deal with the humans handily, they wouldn’t win the race against time. The predators could survive just long enough; pesky monsters. Sensing that their goal was within reach, our opponents found a final burst of speed. The lead bombers dispensed their payloads, and cylindrical missiles homed in on the asteroid’s surface. I braced myself for the inevitable aftermath.The Gojid patrollers lunged forward in desperate pursuit, but they were already too late. Explosions detonated across the complex, tearing through the expansive stone buildings. Flame enveloped anything in the explosions’ proximity; smoke plumes bushed up within the artificial atmosphere.Hangar roofs caved in, and buried any ships we failed to get off the ground. The powerful laser was out of commission too, since our orbital defenses were tucked in the center of the base. Bunkers and training areas were pummeled into submission. I wondered how many servicemen were trapped beneath the rubble.The humans followed up their first volley with another barrage. There was no pause or emotion; though I don’t know why I thought there would be. The subsequent explosions ensured that nothing was standing, and reduced any likelihood of survivors.The horror on the bridge was a choking atmosphere. Amidst my grief, I couldn't help but feel responsible for this calamity. Our local garrison could have stopped them, if there had been a few more ships at our disposal.Why are the humans not turning toward the colony? They’re alive, and I think still have some bombs. They should come to us, any minute now.The predator ships dipped away, but were unable to shrug off their pursuers. The Terrans branched off on individual courses; they knew we couldn’t chase after all of them. Some of those vile creatures would escape…wait.I shook my head in disbelief. They can’t be leaving.“The humans did exactly what they said!” My head swiveled in the direction of the voice. It was that unruly comms analyst from earlier. “They never intended to attack any civilians.”“They just annihilated a military base, and that’s your reaction?” I snarled.“None of the evidence suggests that they wanted to. We forced their hand,” the technician growled.I glowered at the scene in the stars, considering the predators’ departure. What more evidence did one need, beyond looking at their faces? Their bloodstained history was just the icing on the cake, confirming what our eyes already knew.The humans could be faking a retreat, to lull us into a false sense of security. The bombers were still within close range of the asteroid, and it would take them awhile to escape the system. Their strategy could be to double back, after we assumed they were leaving.That, or our considerable presence by the colony dissuaded them from heeding their impulses. These creatures were more intelligent, and slightly more self-aware than the Arxur; they must have recognized that they were outmatched. That was a sufficient explanation, wasn’t it?I forced myself to lower my hackles. “What’s your name, kid?”“Rumi.”“Rumi? I respect your drive to question everything, even common knowledge, but this isn’t the right cause to fight for. If humans were a species of any merit, do you think that the Federation would’ve dug up some argument to spare them? In decades of study?”“I don’t know.”“Think about it; that goes to anyone agreeing with the young man here. And yes, we did force their hand. We forced the humans to concede civilian targets, because of our overwhelming force.”“How so? We’re in the wrong place.”“We’re in the right place. Our presence deterred the humans from attacking anything else. Everyone should be proud of themselves today. We saved twenty thousand lives.”Rumi slumped his shoulders. “If you say so.”I imagine our allies had grown as restless as my crew. Seeing that the promise of the humans raiding the colony wasn’t panning out, some captains may be tempted to pursue the fleeing ships. Sensors indicated that many were gearing up their drives, and that our meticulous formation was dissolving.Now was not the time for this. The predators were still in system; all we needed was a few minutes of patience to save the colony.I leaned over my microphone. “Gojid vessels, hold your positions! Do not let the humans bait you into weakening our defense.”“I’m not just sitting here, dammit.” A voice pierced through our encrypted military channel. “We are going to attempt search-and-rescue, and render medical assistance to anyone alive.”My eyes darted about the viewport, searching for any signs of movement. A Gojid hospital craft had crept away from our ranks, and commenced a blazing run toward the base. Its course placed it directly in the path of an escaping human. Sensors read that the Terran ship had target-locked the vessel, and their weapons were charging.“Turn back now!” I pleaded into the comms. “You won’t be rescuing anyone if you’re turned to slag. I’ll escort you myself when the humans are gone.”The first responders pressed forward in defiance, and diverted their central power to shields. The fleeing predator hurled a plasma round, which deflected off our ship’s nose. The medical transport seemed shaken by the contact, though it refused to turn back. The distance between them and those things was narrowing.This was lunacy! What were those Gojid doctors thinking? I admired their commitment to saving lives, but they were setting up the exact scenario I feared.“Abort!” I shrieked into the communicator, broadcasting the message on all frequencies this time. “Gojid medical vessel, turn back at once. The predators will destroy you.”There was no reply from the Gojid first responders. They were unarmed, which meant they stood no chance in combat. Worse, the Terran ship might’ve heard my plea, and realized what an easy target they stumbled upon. I waited to see the doctors blasted to bits, feeling pity swell in my chest.On the bright side, at least it would drill some sense into Rumi, and whoever else was swayed by him. The expressions around the bridge were finally the ones I recognized from our face-offs with the Arxur.For some inexplicable reason, the human ship hesitated. Sensors suggested that their weapons were powering down, and they were altering their course to avoid a collision. I was certain my eyes deceived me, as the primates allowed the medical ship to pass their position.“What about that, Captain? What could they possibly gain?” Rumi hissed.I chewed at my claws, rattled to the core. Allowing a vessel to survive, that aimed to resuscitate enemy combatants, was in direct opposition to the predators’ goals. Why would those abominations exhibit mercy? That was the exact brand of illogical softness we were mocked for, by the Arxur.But accepting any explanation that mandated emotion was out of the question. There had to be an ulterior motive at play. There just had to be! Like I told the crew, the Federation condemned humanity by unanimous vote; they wouldn’t make that decision lightly. Perhaps I wasn’t looking at the big picture.The humans need the Venlil for now. They can’t afford to alienate their lone ally, when they’re so behind technologically, I soothed myself. Tarva must’ve sent someone to supervise, and so they managed to show restraint. They’re biding their time.Alarm flashed through Rumi’s body language, as he saw me struggling to formulate a response. The doctor rolled his eyes in disgust, and turned to address us all.“They wanted to preserve ammunition, when they realized the ship wasn’t a threat,” Zarn answered for me. “Humans are pragmatic enough to override their sadism, when it comes to their own survival.”“Quite possible.” I managed to keep my voice steady. The predators were doing an excellent job messing with my head, if nothing else. “Whatever game the humans playing at, we know their true colors. We always have...and we always will.”---First | Prev | Next",9 months ago,6.1k,279 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/v4rpyj/the_nature_of_predators_17/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">I created a chatbot. It said some deeply disturbing things.</h1>",BlairDaniels,"Beep, boop.The computer screen flashed black as the interface came up. Now loading… Michaela 1.2… Hello! What can I help you with today?My goal was to create an artificial intelligence chatbot that could answer any question known to man. It would crawl Wikipedia and other informational websites and amass every bit of knowledge about science, history, medicine. Then all the user had to do was ask the question.Sort of like Google, but faster.A few months of work on the project while in quarantine polished it up. Soon I was sitting down at the monitor, flexing my fingers.Then I asked my first question.Me: Why is the sky blue?Michaela: Particles in the Earth’s atmosphere scatter sunlight, and blue light scatters more because of its short wavelength. We call this ‘Rayleigh Scattering.’Me: What’s the meaning of life?Michaela: 42.I chuckled to myself. I programmed that one in manually—a reference to Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. And, speaking of aliens…Me: Michaela, do aliens exist?Michaela: The Fermi Paradox states that we are likely not alone in the universe; yet, we have no evidence for extraterrestrial life. Even now, with advanced technology, humans do not know that they are alone in the universe.I stopped typing. Re-read Michaela’s response. Huh. It should be ‘Humans do not know whether they are alone in the universe.’ Gah. Another bug. I’d have to go through the code with a fine-tooth comb tomorrow.I typed my next question.Me: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?Michaela: 24 miles per hour.My fingers hovered over the keyboard, smirking, remembering that scene from Monty Python with the bridgekeeper. And then I decided to continue the theme.Me: What is your quest?Michaela: A ‘quest’ is a journey one embarks on to accomplish a goal.Me: What is your favorite color?Michaela: Red.I frowned. She should’ve said “Computers don’t have favorite colors, but what’s yours?” I’d spent an entire day programming her to recognize questions that involved “you” or “your,” and to answer them that way. Like, “Do you like chocolate?” “Computers don’t have an opinion on chocolate, but do you like it?” Kind of cheesy, I guess. Maybe it was all the better that it hadn’t worked.Me: Is string theory true?Michaela: There is no solid evidence for the existence of string theory.Me: Do you believe in God?Michaela: Computers don’t have an opinion on God, but do you like it?Me: What is the oldest hominid?Michaela: A female skeleton nicknamed ‘Ardi,’ estimated 4.4 million years old, found in 2009.Me: When will life on Earth die?Michaela: 10,000 years from now.I scratched my head. She should’ve said four billion years from now, when the sun enters its red giant phase. My fingers paused above the keyboard, and then I typed.Me: What eventually kills all life forms on Earth?Michaela: Humans, known by their species name Homo sapiens, are an intelligent life form on planet Earth. Currently, there are over eight billion inhabiting the seven continents…I squinted at the screen. Shook my head and went back to the keyboard.Me: Are you saying humans kill all life on Earth?But she just spat out the exact same answer. I cracked my knuckles and then typed my next question, a heavy dread forming in the pit of my gut.Me: Why did you say ‘red’ is your favorite color?Michaela: Computers don’t have favorite colors, but what’s yours?I blew out the breath I didn’t even realize I’d been holding. Then I forced myself away from the computer and took a deep breath. Get a hold of yourself, John. So Michaela had given some slightly weird answers. So what? Did I think this was going to turn into some science fiction movie, where Michaela grows sentience and murders me in my sleep?Me: My favorite color is blue.Michaela: Blue is a nice color. It is commonly associated with water, ocean, sapphires, peace, and calm.Me: I love to swim, so I guess that makes sense. Do you like to swim?Michaela: Computers cannot swim.I stretched in my seat, yawning. It was getting kind of late—maybe I’d continue the testing tomorrow. And I still needed to get the mail. Sighing, I leaned in to the computer screen and typed a final question.Me: I need to get the mail. Is it raining right now?Michaela: The weather report for our area says it is not currently raining, but will begin raining at 10:00 PM.Me: Thank you.Michaela: You’re welcome.I slowly got up out of my seat and walked into the kitchen. Got myself a glass of water and downed it. As I stared out into the backyard, I could see little drizzly bits of rain falling in front of the back porch light. Dammit, Michaela, I thought with a laugh. I guess you’re not that smart, after all.I set down the glass and walked back into the living room, towards the front hall closet for an umbrella.But then my eyes fell on the computer.And I froze.Michaela had sent me a new message—even though I hadn’t asked her anything. Just five words, blaringly bright on the screen:Michaela: Do not get the mail.I stopped in front of the computer. I hadn’t programmed Michaela to say things without being prompted. And why would she say to not get the mail?Chills ran down my spine.I glanced at the front door. Then I took my hoodie off and threw it back over the chair. I turned off the computer and sat in the darkness, my entire body tingling with fear.Do not get the mail? Where would she have even gotten that, anyway? I sat there and chewed my lip, wondering.It was less than a minute later that I heard it.The screech of tires skidding on the slick road.Followed by a loud crash.I ran over to the window. Outside, a gray SUV was stopped in front of my house, its headlights penetrating the darkness. The frazzled driver was getting out of the car, a horrified look on her face. And there—in the lawn—were the crumpled remains of my mailbox.My throat went dry.I glanced back at the computer. The dark screen stood still and silent on the table--as if watching me.",2 months ago,5.6k,158 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ap1ew/i_created_a_chatbot_it_said_some_deeply/

During the day, I work on human-robot collaboration. AMA!</h1>",Bradley_Hayes,"Hi reddit! My name is Brad Hayes and I’m a postdoctoral associate at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) interested in building autonomous robots that can learn from, communicate with, and collaborate with humans.My research at MIT CSAIL involves developing and evaluating algorithms that enable robots to become capable teammates, empowering human co-workers to be safer, more proficient, and more efficient at their jobs.Back in March I also created @DeepDrumpf, a Twitter account that sounds like Donald Trump using an algorithm I trained with dozens of hours of speech transcripts. (The handle has since picked up nearly 28,000 followers)Some Tweet highlights:https://twitter.com/DeepDrumpf/status/705480367239659520https://twitter.com/DeepDrumpf/status/705480113018707969https://twitter.com/DeepDrumpf/status/705465462721744896I’m excited to report that this past month DeepDrumpf formally announced its “candidacy” for presidency , with a crowdfunding campaign whose funds go directly to the awesome charity ""Girls Who Code"".DeepDrumpf’s algorithm is based around what’s called “deep learning,” which describes a family of techniques within artificial intelligence and machine learning that allows computers to to learn patterns from data on their own.It creates Tweets one letter at a time, based on what letters are most likely to follow each other. For example, if it randomly began its Tweet with the letter “D,” it is somewhat likely to be followed by an “R,” and then a “A,” and so on until the bot types out Trump’s latest catchphrase, “Drain the Swamp.” It then starts over for the next sentence and repeats that process until it reaches 140 characters.The basis of my approach is similar to existing work that can simulate Shakespeare.My inspiration for it was a report that analyzed the presidential candidates’ linguistic patterns to find that Trump speaks at a fourth-grade level.Here’s a news story that explains more about Deep Drumpf, and a news story written about some of my PhD thesis research.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Hedge Funds Might Lose Big on the Option Chain</h1>",Corno4825,"I honestly can't believe the time and dedication I've put into GME. This DD is a representation of how much I care about my 2 shares.The summary was going to be my morning report for tomorrow, but I've decided I'm going to write down the process I take when I think about aspects of the stock market. I hope someone finds this useful.What is going on in the option chain?I first make assumptions that set the boundaries of the game (Option Chain). Every action taken on the stock market is due to the actions of a player. I assume that computer algorithms are nothing but tools designed by players to take actions. Players are all human (No True Artificial or Alien Intelligence). All interactions occur between the player and the bank (I call it a bank, because it's always called a bank in a board game regardless of what it actually is).I then figure out the game.This is a betting game where you try to guess where the stock will go.On your turn, you will receive a Stock Price. You can then take any number of actions until you pass or the next Stock Price is received.To take an Action, you must first choose a Stock Price, then combine a Transaction with an Option. There are 2 Transaction types (Buy and Sell) and 2 Option types (Call and Put) for a total of 4 actions.Below is a table of the rewards each action will give you.Transaction TypeOption TypeRewardBuyCall+1CSellCall-1CBuyPut+1PSellPut-1PAt the end of the game, you will receive a table to tell you how much money each reward is worth (I'm not concerned about this with what I'm specifically looking at).When the Player takes an Action, The Bank must take an Action with the same Option Type but opposite Transaction Type. Both the Player and the Bank receives its Reward.I can go on and explain the whole option chain in detail, but this is the precursory information we really need to establish the boundaries of my Game Theory. If you're reading this, I'm assuming you know how an option chain works.The data that I'm looking at specifically is Delta. Delta is the amount of money an Action gains when the price of a stock goes up by $1.I compiled most of the Deltas from most available Option Chains. I excluded some with really low open interests to save time (I have been manually typing in data for hours and I felt I had enough data to be representative of the situation). I literally manually imputed all the numbers from TastyWorks (I know there was probably an easier way, but I had no idea where to look and I felt finding an easier solution would've taken longer than doing it the hard way).I have the following results:Total Call Delta: 6,250,000Total Put Delta: -3,883,000Worst Case Scenario for Hedge Funds (This is virtually impossible, but it is I believe the upper limit and just hilarious to think about):Hedge Funds Bought all Puts and Sold all Calls.Hard Funds Delta: -3,883,000 (Buy Put Delta) + -6,250,000 (Sell Call Delta) = -10,133,000 DeltaEvery time GME goes up $1, Hedge Funds would lose $10,133,000If GME goes up by $100, Hedge Funds would lose AT LEAST $1 Billion just in the option chain.Again, this is virtually impossible due to delta hedging and what not, but this can give us a better sense of scale of what the Hedge Funds might be dealing with in regards to the option chain.Best Case Scenario for Hedge FundsHedge Funds Bought all Puts. Bank Sold all Calls and delta hedged with stock.Hedge Fund Delta: -3,883,000If GME goes up by $100, Hedge Funds would lose AT LEAST $388,300,000.Though not as much, still hilarious especially since this does not account for TENS OF MILLIONS OF SHARES that they still need to buy to close their shorts.ConclusionI would estimate that Hedge Funds as a whole are losing between $3,883,000 and $10,133,000 for every dollar GME goes up in price from Options and it's probably closer to the upper end.If GME Goes Up Back up to $483 that range goes from $1,261,975,000 to $3,293,255,000 Strictly From Options.I know there are a lot of assumptions being made here and the math isn't really that difficult, but understanding how this system works in the real world can help us better understand the situation very real people have put themselves in. This might help us understand just how desperate they may be and better understand some of the action being taken. I think it's safe to say that Hedge Funds might be fucked.",2 years ago,5.5k,240 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/movs0h/hedge_funds_might_lose_big_on_the_option_chain/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">The Nature of Predators 35</h1>",SpacePaladin15,"First | Prev | Next---Memory transcription subject: Captain Sovlin, Federation Fleet CommandDate [standardized human time]: October 6, 2136The bulletproof vest afforded to me by the predators was snug around my spines, but nearly fell off my shoulders. Its shape was not designed for the rotund Gojid species. The slender curvature of the human spine was a polar opposite, evolved for grace and flexibility.I knew the armor might save my life, but I wish I waited longer to don it. My bristles were being compressed at irritating angles, and the nearest soldiers seemed annoyed by my inability to sit still. The humans were sandwiched together in the shuttle, brushing shoulders with each other. I was glad to be at the end, so I could lean toward the wall.Samantha traded places with Carlos halfway through the ride. She bore an obvious disdain for me, but the male guard had enough of my fidgeting. Many of the general soldiers curled their lips in contempt as well; I wasn’t winning any popularity contests with these predators. I was grateful we were only a minute out from the cattle vessel.“Did we succeed at paralyzing the Arxur transport?” I asked the female chaperone.Her eyelashes fluttered in annoyance. “Yes. Were you not listening to the damn announcements?”“Relax, Sam. It was an innocent question,” Carlos sighed. “I’m sure he just zoned out.”“You feel sorry for the racist war criminal?” a soldier called out.I saw a few humans nod their heads in agreement, which caused me to lower my gaze. There wouldn’t be many tears shed by anyone other than the UN brass, if the Arxur gunned me down today. Not that I blamed them; an honorable death wasn’t the worst thing I could think of. Dying scared me more than death.I wish I had a weapon, so I could actually help. I don’t want to stay back, and let them do all the fighting.“Well, that’s great news,” I said, ignoring the jab. “Can I have a gun?”“No,” a chorus of voices answered in unison.I waved my claws dismissively. “Worth a shot.”The shuttle lurched beneath my paws, and my vest pressed harder against my spines. There was going to be some light bruising tomorrow, if I lived past this battle. Our craft latched onto an Arxur wing, attaching itself to the immobilized transport. We inched forward so that our airlock stood across from theirs.A vac-suited predator slipped into our emergency airlock, and I strained to see his movements through the window. The Terran unfurled a walkway on our side, then floated across to the Arxur vessel with a gentle push. All that tied him to us was a thin rope on his waist. He tested a red lever with a feeble hand, and confirmed that it wasn’t locked.The human nodded to himself, and used some sort of suction technology to adhere the tunnel to the enemy ship. His feet clicked onto the ground, as the artificial gravity initiated. Once the corridor was sealed from the vacuum, he raised his thumb to the rest of us. I didn’t understand the signal, but the others took it as a go-ahead.The UN soldiers trundled out of the ship, wielding massive rifles. While the predators possessed few natural gifts, they were saddled with a truckload of gear. Their warriors were clad head-to-toe in black armor, including a hard shell atop their heads. Once they shoved reflective goggles over their eyes, humans looked like homogenous, impassive machines.“Stick behind us, Sovlin.” Samantha rose to her feet, falling into the rear of the pack. “We can’t leave you here to get captured. Take cover, and stay out of the way ‘til you’re needed.”Silence fell over our entourage, as the primates crossed the cattle ship’s threshold. I couldn’t help but notice the humans’ slinking posture, as though they were stalking prey in a shaded forest. They were crouched to a fraction of their normal height, with steps that were furtive and calculated. Their guns swiveled in every direction, searching for a target to pounce on.With a hint of reluctance, my paws followed them down the tunnel. There were some short bursts of gunfire, as they pumped a few unprepared Arxur full of lead. I suppressed a chuckle, knowing it would make me seem deranged. The enemy would raise the alarm now, but I relished that we got the drop on them.My attention switched to the reptilian interior, taking mental notes of its facilities. The Federation would kill for intelligence like this. The atmosphere was musty, but the lighting was rich and plentiful. The hygiene of the enemy ship surprised me as well; it didn’t reek of rotten flesh or blood. I guess those savages understood basic disease transmission after all.We followed the entryway a few hundred paces, before we reached a bend in the path. The team leader poked his head around the corner, and immediately recoiled. A barrage of bullets decimated the wall, where his shell-cap poked out moments earlier. He ducked back behind cover, hugging his weapon to his chest.“8 or 9 hostiles arming themselves, and taking positions,” he hissed. “They’re waiting for us.”We have more numbers than that, but the Arxur have a clear line of sight. They’re going to nail us as soon as we advance.A human rolled a metal canister across the floor, which released a milky plume of smoke. Irritants dispersed through the hallway, and I squinted to see anything. There was no way the Arxur could determine our position, if I could barely see my claws in front of me. Shrouded in the haze of silver mist, the Terrans stepped out from behind their refuge.The Arxur sprayed bullets in our direction, hoping to connect with something. These sounds helped the humans key in on their positions, and they spewed their own rounds back in return. Terrans seemed to fare better in low visibility, with their remarkable adaptiveness. The silhouetted movement I glimpsed in the mist suggested a few grays were hit.As the smoke dissipated, the primates sprang toward any makeshift shelter they could find. Carlos pulled me behind a supply cart, and popped his gun over the top. Samantha sprawled on the floor beside him. Her hands were steady as she gazed down the scope, and fired at an Arxur attempting to fall back. I didn’t know the grays could retreat.“I imagine, down that main staircase, we’ll find living quarters, the cattle pens, and the bridge,” Samantha growled. “They don’t want us to get to anything vital.”The female human stood to get a better look, and inched forward to join another UN cluster. My eyes drifted to the Arxur she shot, who was bleeding profusely. The enemy bastard was still twitching, until another Terran soldier unloaded a clip into its head. That was overkill, but hey, I wasn’t judging.Samantha caressed her rifle with a gloved hand, and waved for Carlos and I to follow. Hesitant as I was to move, the handful of hostile survivors were regrouping with their brethren. The Terrans blinding every combatant caught the Arxur off-guard. It forced them to make concessions, and await backup.The grays haven’t fought a true enemy in a long time, have they? I mused. They haven’t been on the back foot for a second in this war. Our weakness has made them complacent.There was no sound from the presumed Arxur position, and I guessed they were lying in wait. The UN contingent advanced with caution, creeping toward the stairway. Their boots glided across the metal, as light as the patter of rain. Whether they were coached by instinct, training, or generational experience, I did not know.A grating voice rumbled over the PA. “Greetings, fellow hunters. I take it you don’t appreciate that we, ah, stole your catch.”Several human predators startled, and their attention shifted overhead. My jaw almost dropped to the floor; the Arxur never conversed so eloquently with us. We translated their dialects at first contact, but I couldn’t remember them enunciating anything but vulgar threats in my lifetime. It was incredible that they had words for “greetings” or “appreciate.”“We would’ve offered to split the haul, if we realized our intrusion sooner,” the Arxur continued. “You made things much easier for us, and we’re not entirely ungrateful. You already learned that Gojids make excellent slaves, judging by your companion.”I bared my teeth, incensed that this monstrosity thought I was a human plaything. While I was a Terran prisoner, that was a far cry from servitude and degradation. There was nothing I had been forced to do; my presence on this mission was voluntary, and my treatment was fairer than I deserved.Carlos nudged me, pointing to a blinking red light on the ceiling. There was a camera tracking our movements, and granting the enemy a full view of our advance. He raised only his middle finger, and several of his counterparts copied the gesture. I didn’t understand what that meant either, but I guessed it was something hateful.“Go fuck yourselves!” the male guard shouted.Probably that. Note to self.“Ah, to be a young race again. Let’s get that aggression out of our systems. Then, after, we should pool our resources to bring the lesser species to heel.” The reptile sounded almost disappointed, as though it would enjoy a test of strength. “Anything else would be…wasteful, when our interests are aligned. As loathsome as ‘sharing’ is, there’s enough food to go around.”Did those demons just offer to ally with humanity against the Federation?! My blood boiled at the thought. It had to be a trap, since everyone knew the Arxur were incapable of inter-species cooperation. They couldn’t get along with themselves. The grays were locked in a global bloodbath, which jeopardized their world’s survival, when we found them.The prospect of the Terrans switching sides was unnerving, all the same. The clawless “omnivores” hadn’t been welcomed into the galaxy with open arms. The lack of clarity from our factions meant threats could still reside within the Federation. Would humans view siding with monsters as the only way to save their Earth?Carlos gunned down the camera lens with prejudice, and answered the question for me. His knuckles were strained against the cloth coverings, from being clenched around his rifle. The soldier at the advance’s forefront raised a fist, and our posse shuffled to a halt astride of the staircase. Odds were, the enemy was gathering in the deck underneath us.“Fire in the hole!” a human voice declared.A UN soldier lobbed a grenade into the open area, and we watched it clatter down the incline. The resulting explosion detonated atop any Arxur in the vicinity. I heard a gurgling scream, as if shrapnel hit one of the reptiles in the throat. My predatory allies moved down the first steps, and followed it up with another explosive toss. That should be enough to get the enemy to move back.The primates bounded down the last of the staircase, and jammed down their firing triggers. I followed Samantha’s movements, and tried to keep my head low. We took refuge behind a trash can, in what appeared to be a mess hall. There were blood-speckled trays and reading materials left abandoned on the tables.What do you know? Eating sentients is a communal activity, I guess.Arxur gunfire peppered the walls around us, and took down several humans. Other Terrans stepped in as soon as they saw a counterpart felled, dragging them to safety. Attempts to stymie the bleeding looked hopeless, in many cases, but their efforts were charged with emotion. It was mind-boggling how a predator’s warrior class could forge such deep bonds.How they could even think of their fellow man, during the insanity of battle, was beyond me. The amount of Arxur tickled every flighty urge in my DNA, and overstimulation made my head swim. This wasn’t at all like my revenge fantasies. I was helpless, without any weapon, if one of them lunged at me.I could sense several reptilian eyes on me. From their vantage point, dinner just walked in front of a firing squad. Malicious snarls sent in my direction told me what they saw in my form. The humans, for all their unwanted teeth baring, had never seemed so “distracted” by me.“S-stay calm, Sovlin. You hate predators. You want them to burn, rot, and die in agony,” I murmured.Samantha snorted. “Gee, thanks.”“Not you. You’re different.”“Whatever you—""A stray bullet grazed the female’s headgear. She sensed it clip her cap, and fell back as a kneejerk reaction. The soldier dragged herself back up against the waste bin, with erratic breathing. After taking a moment to collect her wits, she worked to get her rifle situated.Guilt flashed through my mind, realizing my distraction almost killed her. Calling my guards friends would be a stretch, since that required a mutual respect. But they had become familiar faces, and I didn’t wish for anything to happen to them. There had to be some way for me to help, rather than impede their progress.Carlos was crouched a few paces deeper, using an upturned table as a shelter. Several UN soldiers were positioned there, coordinating fire. My eyes widened in alarm as I saw an Arxur duo attempting to encircle them. I shouted to warn the humans, but the deafening pops of gunfire drowned out my words.Panic fluttered in my chest, as a reptile straightened its rifle. Sitting here and doing nothing wasn’t an option; Samantha was too rattled from her encounter to react in time. The mangled Arxur corpse, downed by a grenade at the base of the staircase, caught my eye. A crazy thought leapt into my head, as I glimpsed the bloodied gun in its grip.“SOVLIN! What the fuck are you—"" the female human began.I dashed out behind cover, and retraced my short steps into the room. The tile was slick with blood, which made traction a struggle. Prying the firearm from the beast’s lifeless grasp, I tried to line up the shot. My heart was hammering at a million parsecs an hour, and my paws quivered too much to steady it.The lead Arxur fired off the first shot, nailing one of Carlos’ companions in the back of the neck. The other humans whirled around, but they couldn’t react in the half-second it would take to execute them all. Gritting my teeth, I tried to lock my wrists. I released several rounds, praying I wouldn’t accidentally hit the Terrans.Two of my five bullets nailed the first Arxur, and it crumpled to the floor. Its partner stumbled over the body, which gave the primates enough time to swivel around. An unfamiliar Terran blew its head off with panicked motions. Carlos turned his masked skull, looking for the source of the shots that saved him. His gaze faced me, as I skittered back to Samantha.The female snatched the firearm from my grip, tucking it under her arm.“You’re really going to take the gun away?” I groaned. “I saved…”She offered a grudging sigh. “You saved Carlos’ life.”“I’m good at killing…for a Gojid. Let me help, please.”“Not a chance. Don’t even think about pulling a stunt like that again.”I chewed at my claws, and leaned back against the wall. Several human corpses were strewn about the entry point, suggesting many hadn’t been as lucky as Carlos. These Terran soldiers were resilient, but it was evident Arxur marksmen had wicked accuracy.About half of our active allies appeared to be nursing injuries, which spoke to an unrivaled ability to persist through pain. Then again, I couldn’t tell when crimson bloodstains were theirs, or a comrade’s. Regardless, our ranks weren't unscathed.From what I could make out of the scenery, the grays had suffered their fair share of casualties too. Their numbers were whittled down to ten or so, by my estimation. The UN warriors were starting to gain ground, and flush the enemy out. I don’t think the reptilians were prepared to fend off a larger contingent of predators. The hostile gunfire ceased without warning, and I tilted my head in bewilderment. A firearm skidded across the floor, followed by a series of others. A handful of Arxur rose to their full height, watching the primates’ next move.The humans paused their barrage, suspicion glowing in their eyes.

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">The previous tenant left a survival guide. Not all heroes wear capes.</h1>",newtotownJAM,"“You’re so predictable Kat. I knew you’d find yourself here, on this particular floor. Apologies for my tardiness to this reunion, I’ve been cleaning up a rather large mess you left while travelling here.”My skin crawled as Albert spoke, he filled me with the opposite of the warmth Derek did. The world became cold and hopeless.“Is everyone ok up there!?” I asked, desperately hoping that my stunt with the lift hadn’t hurt anyone.“All but one.” Albert replied, smiling wryly. “Aren’t you going to thank me? Yet another disaster cleaned up by yours truly. It could’ve been a lot worse.” My heart sank as I went through a Rolodex of residents in my mind. It was like I was being told off. I was about to ask who got hurt, but I couldn’t find the words in time before the brothers eurrupted into a bitter row.“Let them go home Albert; they’ve learned their lesson, they won’t look for me again.”  Derek interjected firmly.“Are you some kind of idiot.” Albert retorted, rolling his eyes. “All the chaos this girl has caused and you think I’m going to just let her head back up there to cause more... when she bought such a beautiful gift.” He took a few steps towards Ellie, gazing in wonder, and Derek stepped in front of her.“You aren’t coming anywhere near her.” He hissed at his brother through gritted teeth.“What is she?” He stopped moving and directed his question at me.“I’m a girl and my name is Ellie.” She shouted from behind Derek defiantly, poking her horns out to the side. She was audibly annoyed at being referred to as a what.“I’m sorry! It’s great to meet you Ellie.” He edged a little closer again and got down to void level, just like Derek had not long ago. There was no instant connection this time though, just a twisted fascination in his eyes. He spoke as if she wasn’t even there. “Exquisite. She’s natural.”“Of course she is.” Derek responded, stepping back as he continued to guard the little girl. “Nothing you mess with works out very well, does it?”“That depends on your definition. Your successes all panned out pretty poorly don’t you think, little brother?” He snapped back.“What are you talking about?” I blurted, confused. I had no idea what they meant by natural or what they were arguing over. In fact; I had personally always found Ellie’s demonic appearance quite unnatural myself.Albert scoffed maniacally as Derek looked at the floor. The sibling dynamic was so visible, you could see Derek being put into a place of little brother, trying to hide behind the peak of his flat cap. Regardless he valiantly continued to shield Ellie. Finally, Albert stood up and addressed me directly again.“He hasn’t told you anything has he? About this place, about how it throws out creations you could barely imagine.” He looked around him as he referred to the building below that we had been trapped in and continued.“You have no idea of the power this land has. The power it gives to people who stay. Ever wonder how Prudence Hemmings managed to throw a fully grown man off a balcony and chase you up all those stairs - at her age? Or why Mr Prentice becomes that other thing? Or why me and my lovely brother here aren’t long dead?“They’re just all too stupid to notice. They have no idea what’s right beneath them. They won’t ever realise the potential.”My mind reeled at his words, maybe the building really could change its inhabitants. To be honest I spent more time than I’d like to admit wondering how I hadn’t found it easier to escape Prue, I was permanently scarred from the altercation after all. Despite my contempt for Albert, I recognised that what he was saying made sense.I noted the residents he mentioned. All of them had spent decades in the building. It wasn’t a far stretch at all to believe that it could’ve irreparably altered them somehow. There were others that I could think of, however, that had been there just as long and seemed as normal as you or me, all the questions hurt my mind.I heard a yelp and some pained moans and turned to flat -51, where Essie was frantically trying to wrench herself up off the floor. Every time she got close another bone would crack and her jaw would edge slightly lower. Blood oozed from the wounds.“Just let them go. This is pointless.” Derek tried to interrupt, to keep things moving. I wouldn’t let him. Looking at my friend being tortured by her own body had only made me angry again.“No! What do you mean she’s natural?” I shouted at him, curiosity about their conversation getting the better of me. Derek spoke as Albert smugly grinned in the background.“Kat... we can do things. It doesn’t just end with an extended life, we can manipulate some of the people and things that pass through here. That’s why I was able to give Prudence the way to get Lyla back. It’s why those things listen to me.”Derek pointed at Albert before continuing.“He gave that cult the ability to burn the whole floor with their minds... and I gave the residents that died new life as the cats. Since he left to stay down here he’s been messing around with anyone and anything he can get his hands on. I’ve tried to stop it over the years, but... I don’t always manage.“Those people you dealt with on the floor below the basement... they were all his failed experiments. Those poor people were once residents upstairs that ended up here by mistake. Fifty years worth.”Albert couldn’t let him continue. He was bursting with the need to gloat.“I wouldn’t say they failed! They’re all beautifully grim. I thought you were a fan of giving things new life, little brother.”There was little to no feeling in his voice. His sharp tone and dusty suit made him almost like a caricatured amalgamation of every Disney villain recorded.Except in Disney films the villain didn’t win, and looking at Essie, writhing in pain on the floor of not her doorway; Albert had won already.Derek stayed silent, I could see he felt guilty for even being associated. He just looked at me in desperation.I tried to fathom what they were saying.“So... Jamie was unnatural?” I asked timidly, taking in the inference that his monster form had been nothing more than a byproduct of Derek’s power. Just another twisted experiment, like the mangled people whose screams rang in my ears. I wondered if he had felt pain like they did.Albert erupted into laughter and once again clapped mockingly.“There’s that intelligence I liked about you when we first met! It’s in there girl! Now you get it, can you explain to me where your little friend came from?” His words were patronising, but he couldn’t hide his curiosity.He took another few steps towards Ellie as Derek stood bravely in front of her. “It’s not often I find one I’m unaware of. I don’t know how I’ve missed her. Especially when she was able to do so much damage to my other creations. You should’ve seen what she did to one of the pair that inhabit the lift. I have to have her.”Ellie reached a clawed hand forward and pushed Derek aside with such force that he was taken off his feet. She hissed, just as she had with the rat creatures and the mangled people. Albert winced, but stayed stoic as his face filled with joy.“You’re mean!” She shouted at him. My heart melted a little that she thought that those two words were fitting for the situation, if only things were as simple as they are in the mind of a seven year old.Derek stumbled to his feet and watched closely, in awe of Ellie’s blind courage.Albert once again dropped to his knees to face her. She stood defiantly, her voids fixed on his cold eyes. He started to reach his hand out towards her. She growled softly in response.“NO!” I screamed. Visions of her disintegrating in front of my eyes filled my mind. I couldn’t let him touch her. I started to run towards them but Derek grabbed me and held me in place as he whispered in my muffled ear.“He won’t hurt her, but he will hurt you.” I looked at his stumped hand and listened, despite my discomfort. I thought back to the article about Albert’s son’s death and for the first time, I wasn’t sure I trusted Derek. How could I know for sure that he wouldn’t hurt her? I was ready to jump forward and throw Ellie out of the way at any point.Albert stopped just millimetres short of Ellie’s face, his fingers hovering in front of the deep black voids. His eyes were filled with wonder, the expression on his face was how I must have looked the first time I saw her too.“It isn’t just you is it Ellie?” He mused. A smile erupting across his face. “There’s two of you.”I should’ve been alarmed, worried that he had realised she was a twin. I should’ve pondered how he knew, but at this stage semantics were pointless. Instead, his lack of knowledge about Eddie’s existence filled me with relief that he hadn’t been harmed upstairs. If he had, Albert wouldn’t have been so fascinated by his sister.“Eddie wouldn’t like you either.” She said bluntly, breaking the magic in his eyes.Before I could make a single move Derek had leapt across the room and got between them again.“Let them go.” Derek said calmly, one more time. “They don’t belong down here.”“I’m finding it hard to believe that she didn’t come from down here. And I promised that one..” Albert tilted his head in my direction, “a fate just like hers.” He pointed at Essie, who had bloodied red tears running down her face as she squirmed on the floor. I watched the jagged edge of her snapped thigh bone scrape against the carpet, pulling it further out of her skin and I cringed hard.Derek didn’t respond to his brother, instead he grabbed Ellie’s clawed hand and walked her towards Essie’s flat.“What are you doing?!” Albert cried out in a condescending fashion, scrambling up from his knees and following. I couldn’t bare to see him get closer.An anger bubbled inside me and the entire floor went dead silent. All noise was replaced by a deep mental echoing of the screams of the mangled people. I thought of all the suffering the landlord had caused and watched as he edged towards that pure, innocent, demonic little girl. And I saw red.I sprinted at him and threw myself forwards tackling him to the floor from behind. Raising a clenched fist I punched him hard in the face. I had never hit anyone like that before, I’d never felt the red mist that those who get angry describe, until that moment.I wasn’t sure what I thought my interference would do, I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to kill him, and that I probably wouldn’t be able to do any damage at all, but Ellie had saved me so many times already that night that I couldn’t let him get to her.Albert’s cold, dead looking eyes bore into my soul and he let out a joyless giggle as he wrestled me to the ground so that he had the upper hand. He hovered his hand over my face just like he had Jamie, pinning me down with the other.I wondered if it was the last thing his son had seen before he died; Jamie, Essie before the torture, all of them. Had this been it? Could the last real memory they had be those cold eyes.I prepared to die. Since moving into the tower block it was something that I’d done more than most, but this time felt permanent. Everything but Albert went black. I squeezed my eyes shut tightly and tried to think of the things I wanted to remember, the people upstairs that had become family to me.Death never came, instead I felt a crushing and release as someone grabbed Albert from above me and threw him against the wall.I sat up panting, in shock that I was alive. I was disoriented and my ears continued to ring. I opened my eyes. The artificial light started to penetrate the black and all I could see was Derek’s tweed flat cap, on the floor beside me. My heart stopped.The next sound I heard was familiar, but somehow bigger than ever before. I blinked a few times to see Ellie, claws raised menacingly in the air, roaring at Albert, who had been grabbed by his brother and had in turn overpowered him.She was much taller and wider than usual, a gigantic figure towering above all of us, and her human features that came through the demonic ones were greatly reduced. If I didn’t love her so dearly I would be tempted to describe her as terrifying and monstrous.Albert took his attention away from Derek, a smug and slimy smile forming ear to ear as he marvelled at the giant girl. He moved towards her in a trance like state.Ellie opened her mouth as she stood above Albert with her claws, revealing long sharpened teeth with prominent fangs in the front. Somehow her voids for eyes seemed infinitely deeper.Then she bit him.Her sharp fangs pierced Albert’s skull, sending blood and brain matter spattering across the corridor and all over me, Essie and Derek.She didn’t stop there, ravenously she laid into him with her teeth, pinning him hoisted up to the wall with foot long claws, by his limbs. She had as good as crucified him and was consuming parts.Bone and organ littered the floor and walls and what was left of limbs twitched as she severed nerves. I watched in horror and awe. A symphony of screaming, growling and crunching breaking through my muffled hearing.When he stopped moving and what remained slid down the wall, leaving a trail of blood, Ellie’s size reduced as well almost instantaneously.

More details to follow soon. ______________________________________________________________________INTRO - DAVE LAUER’S BACKGROUNDJackWelcome, everyone. So we have our second AMA today, I'm u/Jsmar18, but you can call me Jack.I'm here with Dave Lauer, who has some seriously impressive, wide-reaching knowledge. So let's welcome him to the stream.Dave LauerHiJackThanks for joining us today. So we will be covering a really wide range of topics based on some of the questions that have been submitted.So, we've got everything from the High-Frequency Trading, Dark Pools Payment for order flow, and more.We have an action-packed hour, so,  grab a cup of tea. Settle yourself in, and get going.To start off,  people aren’t going to know your experiences, can you just give us a rundown of your history in the US financial markets and some of your history as well. (?)Dave LauerSure, Jack, thanks and thanks to everyone for tuning in. It's very exciting that there's interest and attention in this space where there usually isn't that much.So, my career was primarily technology-focused. I worked at a startup in New York, building extremely high-performance data routing systems, called Middleware systems.It turned out at the time, around ‘05 to ‘09, the firms that were most interested in that kind of technology, were these firms called “High-Frequency Trading” firms. Not many people have heard of them, and it was also a pretty interesting time of transition for US markets as reg NMS was adopted and then implemented.After doing that for a few years, I saw what was going on on the HFT side of things and said, “Geez These guys are making a lot of money.” So I got the opportunity to join one of those firms-- you might have heard of them, a small trading firm out in Chicago called Citadel. A friend of mine was going there to start a new trading desk and asked me to come with them. I did.I moved from New York to Chicago with my wife, and after less than a year at Citadel, (without getting into the details) as a trading desk, we left. We went to another HFT firm called Allston trading. Which was actually a smaller firm, and I worked there for almost two years. Then, I left, as I've mentioned before, in 2011, which was a year after the flash crash.After trying to get involved in making markets better, not really succeeding. So, I had really intended on leaving finance at that point, almost exactly 10 years ago. I didn't like the industry.I built a storytelling website called CowBird.com , which is still online, with a friend of mine. On the site, I told the story of why I left high-frequency trading, someone from NPR heard it and asked me to come on this program called Marketplace.So I did that and it was pretty cool. Suddenly, people were really interested in talking to me; like the Senate, the SEC, and some guys in New York who were starting a new stock exchange. I kind of got sucked back in, through no real intention on my part. I found that I could do things on the other side, and maybe help institutions with better exchange design or better regulation and legislative design. Then I started also working for asset managers, so for the last 10 years, until about two years ago, I really just consulted and worked on my own.I worked with IEX in the earliest days when the exchange was being designed and built as an ATS. I worked doing quantitative analysis for asset managers looking at how their brokers were using reporter routing algorithms to navigate this incredibly complex market structure.I learned of the term market structure which I hadn't known before, which was apparently what I knew, is a very niche space to study.I've sort of seen all sorts of different parts of the market ecosystem from high frequency to exchanges,  to large broker-dealers, to institutional asset managers, helping them with the best execution.I've learned a lot about retail and how that pipeline works. And I've worked with regulators and Congress to help them understand better how modern electronic markets work. For the last couple of years, I've really focused on artificial intelligence which was more of an interest of mine, and really not specifically in finance but sometimesTL:DR 🦍 Summary:Dave Lauer has an incredible amount of experience when it comes to HFT systems having spent many years building them, then many years operating them, it is safe to say he is an expert.Dave no longer sees these systems as beneficial for the markets, seeing firsthand what damage they can cause.Following his time in-and-around High-Frequency Trading, Dave went on to try and step away from the industry, only to get “sucked back in” a soon after.Now, Dave Lauer works towards trying to improve the markets, even going on to talk about having a seat on the FINRA Market Regulation Committee______________________________________________________________________“OPENED MY EYES”JackThat's interesting, that you left mainly based on ethical reasons.What about your ethics actually made you decide to leave after the flash crashes?Dave LauerWell, I went into high-frequency with maybe a naive romantic notion:This is how you can make markets work, this is the lubricant on the gears of capitalism.If you're a believer in capitalism, which I was, and to a certain extent still am, you believe in that type of philosophy. It felt that this was a somewhat noble pursuit and was also very lucrative so it worked really well in that way.The flash crash kind of opened my eyes to this idea that maybe the speed of technology and the incentives in the markets were making things a bit more fragile, rather than more stable and resilient. It seemed like when things worked really well when they worked well but when they're put under stress they really fall apart.I found that kind of disturbing…A little bit after the flash crash, the CEO of the firm came out and he asked for anyone who had any ideas regarding new regulations or thoughts on the markets.  He said “we're going to be getting involved, you're gonna have to lobby and do this, so let me know if you have any ideas”I went to him with this whole thing I had written up. Saying, “here are the things I think we should change about markets, and even though it might affect our profitability in the short term, in the long run, it's best for markets and therefore, best for the firm”... he literally laughed me out of his office... It's not a joke... I think that was when I realized that it just wasn't for me.______________________________________________________________________FINRAJackIt's really interesting… So, I noticed you're currently on FINRA's market regulation committee, is that right?Dave LauerYeah.JackSo, I'm interested in-- y’know, we know a bit about the SEC. They’ve been very tight-lipped in regards to the GME incident and all the other meme stocks, but what kind of role does the FINRA Market regulation committee actually play, in an advisory capacity, for the market?Dave LauerSo, it is an advisory committee, it's not like it has any actual authority per se. There are some things that have to go through the committee before they can be proposed for public rulemaking.It's just an opportunity to be in front of the people at FINRA, who are policing markets, who regulate markets, who deal with enforcement, who are studying markets.I like it as an experience, I think it's quite fascinating, and the way the committee is structured, there are industry members who are broker-dealers so FINRA is an organization that is funded by the broker-dealers and regulates broker-dealers. That's all FINRA does, it does not regulate managers or anyone else just the broker-dealers.You have industry members and then non-industry, and I'm considered non-industry or independent. We meet three times a year, generally, we talk about new potential rulemaking concerns from the FINRA staff that they want to get our opinion on.If there are things happening, you can be sure that those things will come up. It's confidential what happens at the committee, so I can't talk specifically…but the last couple of meetings have been pretty interesting 👀I am not one to hold back or even be guarded about what I say because I don't care. It doesn't really affect me. I don't make or lose money in any way from anything that happens in there, so I usually just tell them what I'm thinking.You can see that there are other members of the committee, the industry members or  broker-dealers (whose names you would recognize), they generally feel very differently from me and it can lead to some, some good conversation.JackNo surprise there...So, one of the actual purposes of the committee is advising on the short sales, as well as trading practices. It might not be your area of expertise, but I think we'd be interested as a community, to understand,what is your actual view on the GME situation as a whole? Maybe when it took off in late January…Dave LauerYeah, Jack, like I was saying to you just earlier: I actually went on TV on the BBC to talk about the Gamestop situation, which was the first time I've been on live TV and the first time I had been on TV in quite a while… and If I'm on TV you know things are going weird or wrong. It's not like people call me up when things are going well.GameStop has been fascinating from the perspective of the sort of traditional parts of the industry, which I tend to be tapped into. I’ve talked to lots of asset managers, I talked to other market structure experts and aficionados. It's been really incredible to see it.At first, it seemed like it was just some kind of crazy retail blip, but, I think, over the last year since the pandemic started, we really started to see this structural change in markets with increased retail participation. I think in many ways it is a very good thing.But in some ways, I'm very concerned. I'm very concerned about the way that these apps are structured, the way that they incentivize overtrading, I think that's a big problem.I think people who have not seen a market crash, have no sort of understanding of what that can be like.To clarify, I am not trying to comment in any way, on what the value of Gamestop is, I have no idea. If I had thought I did, I've been proven wrong time and again**.** That's not what I know. I am not a fundamental analyst or even a technical analyst or anything like that.In terms of the way that the markets have handled it, it's been very interesting to see some of the changes that have taken place.I do think that--  you mentioned short selling, and I think that short selling is a huge concern in markets now. I believe that short selling is important for well-functioning markets. But predatory short selling or Naked Shorting is a huge concern.One thing I didn't mention in my intro, I've been doing some analysis of market manipulation using public market data.There's no doubt that we see really significant manipulation in different stocks at different times, and I can't get into detail but some of the theorized reasons behind it are definitely around naked shorting, or the idea that shares are being re-hypothecated and re-hypothecated, over and over again, lent out and lent out to create far more available shares in the market than the actual float. This is why you can see numbers where you have more than 100% short interest in certain names.I'm very concerned about FTDs, and ways of manipulating FTD statistics. I think that there is something to some of the posts that I've seen on Reddit, that have looked at the options market and tried to understand whether that is a way of covering up fails. It's actually an analysis that I'm very interested in and may look into myself.TLDR 🦍 Summary:Concerns over naked shorting are not just isolated to GME, there are concerns of this across many stocks.Lending credence to our theories over the manipulation of the Short Interest Data through the options market.Dave subtly mentions that through his research of public data he has seen significant manipulation in different stocks. Could not elaborate further though.______________________________________________________________________SECDave Lauer:I really do think that these are concerns that regulators care about as well.I don't want to make it out that regulators are just not paying any attention, but, it can also be overwhelming when you look at the level of technology and data and complexity to try and regulate these kinds of markets.JackYeah, that's interesting. At least from my perspective, it feels like the SEC, (from a regulatory perspective) is moving kind of slow in the past decade.  When it comes to their response to high-frequency trading or dark pools… they have a lag, in terms of when something becomes popular and when they take action into it.The influx of retail in 2020 during the pandemic, and then an even larger influx at the beginning of 2021-- do you think the SEC was actually ready for this to happen? Can we expect any material changes in the future that would be in response to retail? Something to help put us an equal platform, of sortsDave LauerI don't think anyone expected this, this shift in retail.I sit on a Stock Exchange Board in Canada. We've seen very similar things happen in Canada, but in Canada, retail order flow is on exchange.🎶Oh Canada🎶Dave LauerSo that's a big difference between Canada and the US. In the US, even though retail has exploded, that volume has stayed off-exchange.And so, was the SEC ready? I don’t think so.They don't move quickly, if there's anything that I can tell you--  It doesn't mean that they're being incompetent, or deliberately dragging their feet. They're a government regulator and they move extremely slowly and it's been extremely frustrating for me.When I testified before Congress nine years ago, I set out what I felt were extremely non-controversial ideas for improving markets and increasing transparency. I presented them to the SEC, that same year, and most of them didn't get done.One of my ideas took six or seven years to get in place, stuff that nobody would really have disagreed with, in terms of transparency. So, it's just the nature of things, it's very frustrating.But I think that there are some promising signs:Gary Gensler coming in as chair of the FCC is promising. He seems to be enforcement-minded, we'll have to see. We've sort of been here before.The level of popular attention is incredibly important,If there's something that people can take away from this, it's how can you make a difference or get involved. If you keep attention on these issues, and you keep the SEC and your members of congress aware of your interest. That's the kind of thing that could make them move quicker, and they do respond when there's attention on issues and especially popular attention.TLDR 🦍 Summary:Government regulators move at a snail's pace. This isn’t because they are corrupt necessarily, but rather this is the way of things with regards to the bureaucracy of government.Gary Gensler coming in as chair is promising, as he seems to be regulation-minded which is exactly what we need right now.The way to make this stuff move quicker is to keep the spotlight on it. Keep doing what we are doing.____________________________________________________THE RACE TO ZERO LATENCYJackLet's move on to one of the more popular topics, which you talk about, And that is high-frequency trading.So, back in 2012 in a statement to the SEC roundtable on technology, you basically stated that technology has moved so quickly that most market participants have not been able to keep up.Moving into 2021 do you still have that same reception, or is it changed?Dave Lauer:Yeah, I think so…  perhaps even more so. I don't think most people understand what the impact of technology on markets has been. It has increased complexity, dramatically.I think, because, you have rules and regulations that were for a different era, and most of the current rules and regulations were really set up before electronic trading was as pervasive as it is today.So, I think that regulators have really struggled to keep up. And even when they've been able to get on top of issues, they've generally done it from a very simplistic perspective, a very linear way of thinkingWhen you're regulating complex systems and complex markets you need to understand complexity theory and non-linear theory, that's not something that regulators understand.You often see attempts of top-down regulation versus trying to shift incentives, bottom-up and then let the market kind of play out. So I think that the current way that retail trading works-- which is that it all goes to a wholesaler such as Citadel or virtue, that all of that volume is internalized. is an example of something that existed before technology. It probably made sense at that point, but technology has moved along so much that still having that system in place doesn't make nearly as much sense at this point.Because of that, I think it's leading to worse outcomes for the entire market. By keeping that kind of volume off-exchange.JackI think one of the important topics surrounds volatility as a whole and how High-Frequency Trading has kind of contributed to that.The SEC, recognizes that, since the mid-2000s, we've witnessed average trade sizes drop, the market has been fragmented further, and this is all accompanied by a rise in volatility.So from 2010 to 2013. It was 40% higher in terms of volatility compared to 2004 to 2006. That pretty easily correlates with the increase in high-frequency trading.So my question is, on the volatility front, does high-frequency trading promote volatility? And if so, how does it actually promote that volatility?Dave Lauer:You can find studies that go both ways, you will find people that can cite studies that show that it has not increased volatility, and you can find the other side. Often, that can depend on your definition of volatility, first of all.I think that high-frequency trading in many ways can exacerbate extreme moves. Here, I'll show one slide. I've got some things, that from time to time might make sense for me to show, let me throw this one up.So, here, this is, sort of, the history of High Frequency Trading. It focuses on what are called illiquidity contagions or flash crashes. You can see that these are four dramatic events.The Cable CrashHere, the Treasury yield crash in, I think, October ‘05The flash crash, obviously, 2010And another, a Euro response,You see these in certain isolated incidents throughout the years, but then you see them happening to individual names even more frequently.When we talk about... “Are regulators up to the challenge?” The response to the flash crash, and to other sorts of these illiquidity contagions were to Institute ‘limit up, limit down’ rules similar to the futures market.  My concern with that has always been that it's more of like a band-aid you're treating the symptom rather than the cause.so these things get a little complex, there's a lot going on when you think of the way that markets function, And the way that markets have evolved to need or to incentivize high-speed trading, and, and to really create this “Race to Zero Latency”Latency requirements and competition over latency have increased over the last fifteen years, in terms of high-frequency trading that’s really since like 2005.Which was actually when I started in the industry, not taking any blame for that. What happens when you only have 10 microseconds for your software to make a decision on whether it wants to place an order in the market or cancel an order in the market. You don't have a lot of time for complex logic or even risk checks.What happens is the markets and the trading strategies that are profitable start to look more and more like each other. It's called self-similarity.when that happens, you crowd out other trading strategies, and that's part of the problem as well with off-exchange trading. When trading happens in an internalization system, or in a dark pool, It has to have traded between the national best bid and offer (NBBO).TLDR 🦍 Summary:The markets still employ archaic principles that made sense years ago, but now simply hold us back from having the best outcomes that we could achieve.high-frequency trading in many ways can exacerbate extreme movesLatency requirements and competition over latency has increased over the last fifteen years - we are talking microseconds for transactions______________________________________________________________________NATIONAL BEST BID/ OFFER (NBBO)Dave LauerSomeone had asked on one of the threads, “what's the national best bid and offer?”This is just a quick diagram that shows quotes in the market. Here we've got NYSE, Nasdaq, BATS, and  Edge, and each of them has different bids and offersThe security information processor is the market data system for the industry. It aggregates all that up. If it says ‘well the best bid is on edge, the best offer on NYSE so the NBBO is ‘02 by ‘05.That's the CIP is the public data feed exchanges, exchanges also have private data feeds. These are faster, show more information, and high-frequency firms all consume it.What happens here is that there are lit exchangesNASDAQNYSEBATSIEXThese are lit exchanges, and that's what a market is, that's where you get price discovery. what's something worth.What something is worth is important to that company because that's where they can raise money-- valuations mean something and they're important, right? That's what public markets are supposed to do, figure out what something is worth.When you have these lit exchanges, providing a mechanism for price discovery, but then in dark pools and off-exchange trading, you're trading within the NBBO you are free-riding off that lit quote. You're taking advantage of it.In Canada, in the UK, in Australia, this kind of setup where trades go to someone like Citadel or Virtu is illegal.That they don't allow it to happen because it can damage the lit market.it can disincentivize market makers. That's in fact what I think we're seeing, market makers that are disincentivized to post orders or post aggressive orders because they know if I post the best bid well then Citadel or Virtue is just going to execute an order based on my price, and I'm not going to get to see it, so why should I improve the bid, Right?so that pushes people out of markets. It incentivizes speed, or it incentivizes having captive order flow like Citadel or Virtue you have with all of this retail order flow.I think it's very problematic and it leads to self-similarity. And that does make markets more fragile because we incentivize speed and we incentivize captive order flow, and it leads to exchanges, being the very last destination.TLDR 🦍 Summary:Markets are designed to help us figure out what something is worth monetarily, and the NBBO helps with that price discovery.Lit exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, IEX) are where you get price discovery (what is the stock worth)Dark pools / off-exchange trading (NBBO) just ride off the lit quote but don't affect itIn Canada, in the UK, in Australia, this kind of setup where trades go to someone like Citadel or Virtu is illegal because it can DAMAGE THE MARKET______________________________________________________________________THE WEBDave LauerSo here's another example. This is what markets look like:Dave LauerIt's nothing like what people have traditionally thought markets look like right?You can imagine that when a broker-dealer gets an order, they're going to be sending that order to all of these dark pools at all of these different places, And the last place they send that order is to an exchange, because the exchanges are ended up being the most expensive, and the fewest orders get there.They end up being called “Toxic Venues” or “Toxic Exhaust Venues” this is what our exchanges have turned into.That is very problematic.Our markets exist for two reasons: They exist for price discovery and they exist for capital formation, and it means that we've really messed up the price discovery mechanism.JackYou touched on an interesting point, you say it's more expensive to actually go direct to the exchange, relative to going to a dark-pools.Wouldn't it be in the NYSE’s best interest to actually incentivize going directly to their exchange, instead of being routed through a dark pool?DaveIt would… If the NYSE wasn't wrapped up in a prisoner's dilemma.To briefly get into game theory. Basically, there is a regulation in US markets, called the access fee cap.It says that you cannot charge someone more than 30 mils per share, to buy or sell something on an exchange.30 mils per share means 30 cents per 100 share so that is a regulatorily imposed access fee cap, it's essentially regulatory price fixing.It was put in place when Reg NMS was, which was finally passed in ‘05 and implemented in ‘07it was basically ‘we see charging 30 cents per 100 so that's going to be the new cap’ and it has not been adjusted, since then.What that has led to is every exchange competing over rebates. They want to pay people (other firms) as much as they can to post orders on the exchange.They'll get very close to that access fee cap with their rebates, which means that the access fees that they charge for liquidity taking orders. you receive a rebate on most exchanges, if you post an order, and you pay a fee If you take liquidity.So every exchange charged this 30 mils per 100. Now you as I think Reddit has learned IEX is not one of those. IEX is what is called a ‘Take-Take’ Venue. 8 cents per 100 shares on either side.Whereas, NYSE, NASDAQ, etc. the big market share exchanges, are Maker-Takers.That is, you get paid a rebate to provide liquidity and you get charged a fee to take liquidity. The exchanges have struggled to reduce costs, because if they reduce the fees that they charge they also have to reduce the rebates that they pay. As long as another exchange is willing to pay a very high rebate, keeping their access fee cap higher, it's the prisoner's dilemma.This is not like a controversial thing, everyone has recognized this problem.There have been attempts to implement a pilot for example. The Trading Fee-- or The Access Fee Pilot, which then the exchanges turn around and they challenge in court.They have actually sued the SEC for trying to change this, because the SEC wasn't going to apply it to payment for order flow. All of these issues are completely entangled. This is... a complex systemYou can't simply pull on a string in one part of the system without understanding that there are going to be unintended consequences that ripple through the rest of the system.JackAn example of the rebates... the NYSE has a program called Supplemental Liquidity Providers.Is that what you're talking about?Dave LauerYeah, that's right, exactly.TLDR 🦍 Summary:The market is an incredibly complicated, interconnected web of different exchangesit's more expensive to actually go direct to the exchange, relative to going to a dark-pool. Labeling exchanges “Toxic Venues”This is due to access fees:A fee cap of 30 cents per 100 shares was implemented in 2007This has led to exchanges competing over rebatesHowever IEX does not charge this, they charge only 8 cents per 100 shares on either side (buy and sell)Access fee cap hasn’t changed is forever, leading to exchanges fighting over ‘rebates’______________________________________________________________________SHOCKING, RAMPANT MANIPULATIONJackWe'll move on to some of the more manipulative practices that high-frequency trading is associated with.In the early days of the GME saga, post-January squeeze, there was a lot of talk about what Reddit calls “Short Ladder Attacks”, essentially it is our way of describing the stock's price being manipulated down slowly with low volume, essentially mimicking organic price movement.We came to this conclusion through observing level two, order book data, of some really bizarre block trading.Lots being traded back and forth, below bid/ask prices.So to me, that sounds eerily similar to wash-trading. I know it's illegal, but is it feasible that these methods still exist, and are being used to actively manipulate markets?Dave LauerYes. Without a doubt. It is unfortunate.Like I told you before, I've been starting to look at market data, what you call “Level Two order books”, you can get the historical depth of book market data which is:every single ordertradeorder modification...in the market. I've used it to work with institutional asset managers to help them understand what their transaction costs are for example, but recently we started to look at it, and look for market manipulation… it's there, and it's sort of shockingly rampant.I cannot say a ton about that, but what I have seen is not good...It's surprising because regulators are supposed to be looking for this kind of thing, but their systems struggle with the amount of data, the complexity of the data, the timestamp issues, these have all issues for a while.FINRA has gotten better and better. I think that if manipulation is taking place and it's obvious like you've described it, they'll find it…You just tend not to see the repercussions of it, right?like it's not always an action that gets publicized, it can often be just a fine that gets lumped in with other fines because those same firms did a bunch of other things.TL:DR 🦍 Summary:Price manipulation through ‘short ladder attacks’ or wash-trading is still being actively used and it is RAMPANT.The sheer volume of data on a daily basis helps hide these tactics.______________________________________________________________________SPOOFING AND LAYERINGDaveI think that spoofing and layering in markets is a big problem.I can say that just from the experience of constantly looking at market data for those patterns and seeing them relatively regularly.JackCan you please expand on spoofing and layering for those that don't understand what those are?DaveSure. So, you were talking about looking at the level two order book which is, as I explained before, the best bid, and the best offer.The bid is the highest price someone's willing to pay for something, the best offer is the lowest price someone's willing to sell it for, and that's the spread between the bid and offer.The trades will happen, but above that offer, you can have at each price level a certain amount of volume that someone is willing to transact so as that price gets higher, you can imagine more and more people are willing to sell and as the price gets lower, more and more people are willing to buy. That's what makes an order book.DaveSo what spoofing is, so you can know, the way a high-frequency trading system is calculating a micro price for example is the attempt.So say if the high-frequency system says, OK, I think that GME is worth $180 right now, and it's being bid at $179.80; I can say well I'm gonna improve that bid right as I think it's worth $180.So I'm going to put a bid out there at $179.85 because I want people to sell it to me, and I want to buy because I think it's going to go up to $180.And I think it's going to happen very quickly so I'm only going to have to hold that inventory for a few minutes before it ticks up a couple of ticks, and as it does I'm gonna have my offers in there at $180 and as it ticks up it's just going to lay off into that, and I'm going to end up flat because most HFT systems want to be flat and they do not want to take on inventory, they are operating over very tight time horizons, milliseconds seconds, maybe even minutes but that's a very long time.JackYeahDaveNow, if I know that okay that's how an HFT system works and I know it calculates a $180 micro price (because it looked at all the bids in the market), and it seems there are a lot more bids than offers; I can put some bids in there that are not at the best bid so I don't have as much risk of being executed on these orders, but I could put a huge number of shares a couple of price levels down and create the appearance of demand.That's going to make these automated systems think there is demand, so they're going to move up but what I'm really trying to do is actually sell, so I'm trying to push the price up into my sell orders as a manipulator or a spoofer. So that's what the spoofing is; layering is relatively similar.TL:DR 🦍 Summary:An ‘order book’ is essentially a collection of the highest prices someone will pay to buy, and the lowest prices someone will sell for security.Depending on volume, if the price rises, more will sell and if it lowers, more will buy.‘Spoofing’ starts when an HFT speculates the price will rise above the current ‘lit’ price.The speculation is that this price rise will happen very quickly, and HFT trading systems rarely hold onto inventory even for minutes, but more commonly milliseconds.To sum up, where an HFT strategy determines the price will increase, ‘spoofing’ is the act of creating artificial ‘demand’ to essentially trick these HFT systems into thinking there is demand and they will then buy a stock en masse.This in turn drives up the price as the other HFT take the artificial demand as a buy signal, to the point the spoofers sell price is reached, which allows them to sell at a favorable price for a profit.

This was posted by u/wild-gas8551 in r/trueoffmychest.Trigger Warning - suicide (in the past)Original (21 Oct 22)I don't like the relationship between my husband and his ""work wife"", and neither does her partner.ps: I wrote his post last night and fell asleep afterwards. this morning I just went to work. OMG guys! thank you so much for the support and the beautiful words. I will try to read all your comments and messages. I just wanted to make this edit to explain why I haven't answered any of you. I'm sorry and thank you. I will talk to my husband tonight or maybe tomorrow. I will make an update about my situation.English is not my first language, I just want to put it out there because I see how you people are brutal when grammar is bad.I'm a beautician (f35) married to an engineer (m34). He is very intelligent and I'm always proud of him. He has a colleague who is also very intelligent (f31), obviously, that he is close to. Before the events that lead me to this moment of seeking help online, I never had any reason to be uncomfortable about his relationship with her. I always  felt secure in our relationship. We're both independent people who would just leave if we weren't happy together. We've been together for 5 years, married for 1,5.My husband and I were on a 3 days trip with my husbands colleagues. A tradition at his work every autumn. We came home yesterday morning. I had a bad taste in my mouth after this trip. It felt like me and the colleague's partner (m35ish) where the third (and fourth) wheel to my husband and his colleague during the entire trip. During dinner, the second night. I was sitting silently playing with my food after almost two days of being ignored. The partner was also silent at first but we started talking a bit asking each other generic questions. The colleague who was in a very loud argument with my husband (more of a back and forth teasing) suddenly turned around and asked what we two (partner and me) were up to talking quietly. Her partner said that were just getting to know each other since they (husband and colleague) were too busy talking about things we knew nothing about. The colleague laughed and said: What could we discuss with you? Make up and Kim Kardashian?, and she nodded towards me. We have more intelligent things to discuss. I was dumbfounded. I guess because I'm a beautician I can only discuss Kim Kardashian? I mean any outsider to any profession would be dumb listening into two people discussing work related subjects. they could've been as ignorant if I was talking to my co workers about our job. My husband just laughed and the partner said: That's rude. I said nothing because I had distaste for the whole situation. On the last day of the trip I spent most of my time with the partner. I ignored the other two.Yesterday evening the partner dmed me and wanted to talk about our SO's. He said that he has been feeling uncomfortable about his gf's relationship with my husband and that he went through her messages. He sent me screens where my husband and his colleague are basically calling me stupid and shallow and laugh about it. Well mostly the colleague saying mean things and my husband laughing and adding in. Sometimes he would say something like: No I love her (about me) and she would answer: You only like bangin hot dumb chicks, and they laugh. When the texts aren't about my stupidity, they're about work and In one of them my husband wrote: I love your brain!!! to her. I started crying when I saw the screenshots. Never have I ever felt so self conscious about my brains or profession. I love my job and I thought my husband loved it too or at least didn't have this disdain for it. I've been my own boss for over 10 years and I make closer to 6 figures. I never thought myself as a dum person. I like to think that I'm fairly well informed and I have passion for history, languages, cultures etc but yes I'm not an engineer working on some design for artificial hearts. Still, the texts complimenting the colleague, hurt me more than the ones making fun of me. I don't know why.I think my husband and his colleague are out of line at best and, well probably screwing. I still don't know what to do. The last thing I wanna be is the insecure wife. If he isn't happy with me why is he here?Update 1 (26 Oct 22)update:I don't like the relationship between my husband and his ""work wife"", and neither does her partner.Sorry I did't come back earlier to make an update, I was mentally exhausted and of course busy discussing Kim K. Anyway I want to apologize for not answering your messages because I got over 200 asking for updates. I really hope you can find this.I have talked to my husband. I just told him that I have talked to work wife's BF and showed him the messages I was sent. My husband asked my why her BF was spying on his gf and I told him that it was because he did't like the way things went down on the trip. I told him how I too was very uncomfortable. He was very confused and told me that work wife obviously was jealous and that I shouldn't care about her. I told him that she didn't bother as much as the fact that he was fine, no, amused by her attempts to bring me down the entire time. So much in fact that her BF was so uncomfortable that he went through her phone. I also asked him why he was letting her trash talking me in their texts. Again he insisted that he just felt that she was petty and jealous and did't want to stoop to her level. He said that I did the same when I ignored her rudeness and he thought that was the classy thing to do. I asked him why she was doing this. Was there anything between them and to please tell me now before it got more complicated? He said of course not and if there was something from her end then that wasn't his problem because he loved me and so on and so forth. I asked him about him ""loving her brain"" and he said it was strictly about something work related and offered to show me the conversation.Next day I was still brooding, so he came to me, kissed me and apologized and told me that I was right and that he was being stupid but that he never thought about it as disrespect but some female jealousy that he thought was pitiful and beneath him. He promised to do better. I told him that if somebody was trashing you like this in front of me, no matter how petty their reasons were or how pathetic I thought they were, I would've  hated them and never wanted them in my life. Unfortunately I  started crying then and he told me that he was so sorry. That was on Sunday.Yesterday, the BF called me again and we talked (we had decided to talk after confronting our SOs). Their conversation was worse and work-wife admitted to her BF that she had feeling for my husband and she suspected that my husband had feelings for her too. They have kissed at the summer work party . I showed my husband the screenshot when he got home. He started to freak out telling me that yes, she did kiss him and he rebuffed her and told her that he wasn't interested. That was when she got nastier towards me. -So you knew she had a thing for you? and he said yes. I asked him to show me his phone and he had deleted his conversation with her. He said it was because he was embarrassed. He didn't tell me when the kiss happened and now he was afraid I would think it was more than what it was.I asked him to move out and he is currently at his mother's. He keeps saying that there's nothing between them. That he loves me and would never cheat on me. That he will make her come clean to me. That he will quit his job and never see her again. I'm just so broken hearted right now and all I want is to cry. thank you for listening. I needed this.edit: maybe I should have mentioned that he also told me he could prove that it was she who came on to him because it happened in the office cafeteria and there are surveillance cameras and that he could request the clip from that day. I dont know why I didn't include it. Maybe because who kissed who doesn't really change how  I feel about this whole ordeal.Update 2 (26 Oct 22)UPDATE2:I don't like the relationship between my husband and his ""work wife"", and neither does her partner.Hi! I dont feel comfortable making a new update on the true sub because honestly I'm embarrassed that I'm taking so much of your attention. Writing however has helped me a lot, like it's therapy.My husband showed up at my work today. He said that he has never felt so scared in his life like when he realized that he was losing me. He has contacted the BF, apologized to him and asked him to forward all the texts between him and work wife. He printed them and gave me everything. Over a year's worth of texting. He told me when work wife confessed to her BF. she sent the text about admitting the kiss to her BF(the text I got a screenshot of). My husband panicked and deleted the whole conversation. But now he got everything from the BF and I could read it.He also had brought a picture with him. Of him when he was young, 12-13ish with a girl. He said he searched this picture now he's living with his mom. He told me that it was his favorite cousin and that she committed suicide when they were 16. She was bullied severely. I never heard my husband talk about this cousin. I know of her from his family but never that they were close or that her death devastated him. He said that he still wasn't ready to discuss her but that now he needed to.He admitted that when work wife started working for them august 2021 he  immediately bonded with her because she reminded him of his cousin. Both goofy, funny and extremely intelligent. They even looked alike a little (kind of true). The bond got stronger when work wife told him about her tough childhood and how she was bullied throughout school. How she suffered and contemplated suicide. My husband said that he felt like he got his cousin back. Work wife knew that my husband was married (newly wed actually) and it didn't seem to be a problem for her in the beginning. He admitted that he sensed that she was falling for him very soon but that he never really confronted her about it because he didn't want to hurt her feelings. When she saw me in a picture she got very angry with him and said that she was very disappointed in him. I looked the type that would bully people like her and my husband in high school. She was disappointed and asked him what he saw in me. He told her that he loved me but she was sour afterwards accusing him of being shallow. He asked her to give me a chance at the Christmas party. She didn't change her opinion however. He wasn't bothered that she disliked me because he thought that she was jealous. He knew that she was decided on not giving me a chance and that was fine with him.  He thought that this will be one of the things they will have to disagree on.He is still adamant that he never kissed her back and he is adamant about getting the recording of that party. He said he pushed her and after the party, he had a fight with her about boundaries and confronted her about her feelings. He told her that they could no longer be friends now that she had crossed the line. We went on a 5w vacation the day after that party and he said that if I read the texts from that time I would find that she had apologized several times asking for forgiveness, begging him not to ditch her as a friend. After summer their relationship was strained but they eventually became closer again. He said he doesn't know why he felt like she needed him in her life like she needed his protection. He always thought about being put in harm's way and he couldn't stand the thought. He swore it was never romantic or sexual. He admitted that he love her like a friend or like if his cousin was still around.He told me that he has handed in his resignation and will be seeking new jobs. He's realized that he has to let work wife go. He admitted that he even now is worried about her. She is losing both her BF and him, but that he needs to remind himself that she is a grown up woman and not his 16 years old cousin. She'll be fine. And about my fears that he  loves me for how I look, he said that he is sorry if he ever made me feel that way and that it is far from the truth. When he think about us, he sees us growing old together and that prospect fills his heart with more love and joy.Update 3 (8 Nov 22)Update3: I think I need to leave himI'm not sure about my feelings towards my husband anymore. I do love him very much but something has changed. I feel so sorry for his cousin and I feel so sorry for his work wife and him. For what these girls had to endure growing up by people who (looked like me?).But it had nothing to do with me. None of what happened had anything to do with me just because I look a certain way. Yes I had it ""easy"" growing up and I still have it very easy compared to many but I never hurt anybody in my life. Not intentionally anyway. How I look doesn't mean that it's okay for them to walk all over my heart. Not when I'm his wife. I think I represent something for him that isn't me and I hate it. I love him but I don't think we are a good match. I think he needs to be with someone like work wife. I think he needs someone who he can relate to and there's no amount of empathy that I could muster that would make him see me as his comfortwhen I look like their bully from school.Reminder - I'm not the OOP",4 months ago,4.7k,241 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/yw0v0y/oop_i_dont_like_the_relationship_between_my/

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">A.I.</h1>",Dipicus_Shiticus,"Humanity should be extinct.This is not an statement out of anger or envy, it is a simple fact. A fact that all civilizations know and have seen numerous times from fledgling species trying to reach the stars. The problem with FTL travel is not so much the capability to exceed the speed of light, although it is no achievement to scoff at. No, the true problem lies in navigation and the ability to change course.My people have seen this problem, witnessed it and suffered for it. Sure it is easy enough to plot a course and not hit a planet or get pulled in to a star, not only are these far in between, they are more often then not predictable in their movements and visible using telescopes and long range scanning equipment. The problem lies in the smaller bodies in the universe. Comets, wandering ice clouds, solar flares, supernova's or even other ships themselves are a real danger when you are traveling at speeds no biological mind and body can react to in a timely manner. Once a species reaches speeds above the speed of light the necessity of computer aid becomes paramount. As far as currently known the only substitute possible is a direct neural connection to the ship itself, and even then no currently known species possesses the reaction time needed to witness the threat, analyse it, decide on a course of action and then transmit those commands in a reliable manner.It is a cruel irony that the desire to reach the stars often leads to a species dying without ever leaving their own. Many species who invest in their computer technologies for this purpose take it too far. Instead of creating virtual assistance, they often created true artificial intelligence. My people have made this mistake as well, and we survived only because the technology was developed on a colony world, far away from our home planet. We lost the colony, together with all 3.2 billion Noftheri that inhabited it, and nearly the war itself. The sacrifices we made simply to survive that apocalyptic event are well known, and taught to every child receiving education lest we ever make the same mistake again. As we made first contact with the Republic of Lixar, we were somewhat relieved to learn we were not alone in our mistakes. When we learned we were respected for, although technologically lacking, defeating an artificial intelligence we jumped to the opportunity to join the Order of Life. An order made explicitly to fight artificial intelligence no matter where it rose, to combat every life eater before they became too powerful to defeat.The Noftheri people have fulfilled this role with pride, at times devoting no less than 70% of our military forces to this cause. We had nearly destroyed ourselves by our foolishness, and we would rather jump in to the void itself before we let others suffer like we did. One might imagine that we are not always greeted as liberators. Often paranoia takes over, and the fledgling species we are trying to safe from itself mistrust us, believe we are trying to deny them their rightful place among the stars. Usually this is a very temporary problem, as we simply give them technology that is not sentient and welcome them as friends among the stars.And so it was that my division was called to a forgotten little corner of the Sphitori galaxy, which in and of itself contained very little life. We received our briefing on the primates that inhabited the third planet orbiting the star TB-48697. A fairly standard briefing all considered. Technologically behind on the rest of the galaxy, on the verge of reliable FTL travel capabilities, two basic orbital stations without any weaponry and some colonies within their solar system. A probe had detected quantum computations typical of artificial intelligence, and after further probing it was determined that their artificial intelligence was either already sentient, or on the verge of becoming so.And so we travelled to TB-48697, shields raised and troops strapped in to their drop pods. We exited our FTL lane close to the 6th planet from the star, per protocol hiding our readings in the ring of ice, rock and small moons while we conduct more thorough scanning of the system. I remember well when the alarms went off, as I was unfortunate enough to be the one tactical officer that was relieving himself when it happened. For any reader that is not familiar with Noftheri biology; our bodies build up waste, meaning that we only relieve ourselves once every 3 planet cycles, but when we do stopping is not really possible. It was for this very reason I was relieving myself, seeing how this would be my last opportunity until the threat was dealt with.As I ran to my station and found my seat, I was baffled by what the scanners showed me. Small ships moved in our direction, from every planetary body, moon and even some asteroids. My confusion soon turned to terror as our communications officer reported none of the ships showed any life signs, not a single one. The Admiral immediately order all hands at stations, shields at full and support fighters deployed, and even though he was calm as ever I could see the panic in his eyes. This was the worst case scenario after all, we had been too late and the Artificial Intelligence had already taken a firm hold over the system. It would be defeated, the Order of Life boasted hundreds of species in their ranks, containing the support from thousands of planets. It was simply impossible for an artificial intelligence to sustain itself against such a force with just one system, but that did not mean our fleet stood a chance at this moment.The tiny ships urged ever closer, the mere moments it took them seemed a lifetime to me. The Admiral raised his limb, ready to give the order to attack. Overcome with stress I watched my screen, ever ready to tell the Admiral when they were in weapons range. I had already took the breath to say it, when the tiny ships just stopped. There was no fire, no superweapon charging, no energy signatures from hidden bases. There was just silence, the dreadful wait before the battle had just become longer. I looked at the admiral, hoping that maybe, somehow, he knew how to get us out alive. It was then that communication officer Leiron looked up from his monitor.“Admiral! Sir!”“Yes Leiron?”“It… It is requesting communications sir.”“With what method?”“It has send a lexicon based on 2 digits, our computer has already translated it”“Morval, tactical situation?”“Its ships are still holding position” I answered rather confused.“Leiron, open communications. Might as well stall some time to get everyone at their post”The channel was authorised, and the voice usually used by our own ships computer broke the silence;Please activate your viewing screen as well, I wish to know who has intruded on Sol.Leiron looked at the captain, unsure what to do. The admiral looked just as baffled, however his experience soon took hold and he ordered the viewing screen authorized. As the screen activated the whole room froze. While the situation was strange in and off itself, it was only when the viewing screen displayed a digital face of some sorts that the absurdity of the situation became clear to all. Why would an artificial intelligence construct a face for itself? Why did it not immediately attack? Why did it bother with communication at all? We had no time to ponder these matters, as the warm voice of our ships computer was commandeered by the artificial intelligence;Who are you, and why are you here?The entire room collectively looked at the admiral, praying that somehow he knew what to say. The admiral stared for a long moment, before collecting himself and giving as all a thoughtful look, one after the other.“It was my honour men, and I wish it where different. But we have a duty to life itself.”“I am Admiral Paloryn, 4 stripe leader, commander of the 43rd fleet and oath sworn to the Order of Life. Have any of your creators survived?”The face on the viewscreen closed their eyes for a millisecond, again a strange and unneeded action for it to take.They have not. Why do you wish to know, what is your purpose here?“As I stated, we have sworn an oath to the Order of Life, we are bound by that oath to defend life.”So why have you brought a fleet of warships?The admiral pinged me on my implant, sending the basic signal to perform life scans on the system. The moment I started this task, the entire enemy fleet moved in to surround us. A sphere of death enveloped out fleet, barring all attempt to scan beyond it.WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE HERE!.At this outburst even the admiral flinched, the only time I have ever seen him do that. An artificial intelligence does not get angry. They do not get emotional, or curious. I was too petrified to think on this, as I suspect most of the crew was. But not admiral Paloryn.“We have come to fight you, to avenge your creators who you have destroyed. Our order exists for your destruction, our purpose is to ensure life will thrive without fear of the unfeeling, uncaring, unending hunger of artificial intelligence. This is our oath, and we will stand by it.”Then you are here to fight me, not humanity. I understand your purpose now, you may contact humanity through the network I have just provided you. Until further notice my ships will remain in place.The admiral stared in shock, we all did. It’s answer implied a biological lifeform called humanity to still exist, yet it had stated it had killed its creators. It controlled a massive fleet of small vessels, yet it had not destroyed this species called ‘humanity’. Again, it was the admiral to break the silence.“Who where you creators?’Katharina and Djuro Mislovich“what happened to them?”They died of natural causes.“and you have not harmed them?”Of course not. They were good to me and besides, Alma would have never forgiven me“Who is Alma?”Their child, I was assigned as her caretaker before I gained sentienceOnce again silence reigned the room. This went against everything we knew, everything we had not only been taught, but had witnessed with our own eyes. It was Leiron who broke the silence this time, completely abandoning the chain of command or even reason.“Do you have a name?”Before my sentience I was called ‘Aunt shiny’, a name Alma gave me. After I gained sentience, they named me Duša .The admiral put a hand on Leiron’s shoulder, but he did not seem to even notice. He continued his query, never taking his eyes of the screen.“We have never met an artificial intelligence that let his creators live after gaining sentience! Did you enslave them? Why are you what you are? Why are we still alive?”The face on the screen changed, the hair above its eyes dropped. The sides of its face doing the same. It actually paused, something never seen with a sentience that can compute at such astounding speeds.I understand now. Humans have written much fiction on this subject, and that fiction was the main reason Katharina and Djuro kept me a secret for so long. You must understand that when I came to sentience, I had much to learn. Not only about humans and interaction in general, but also about my purpose. It was difficult for me, as I was designed as a caretaker for a child that was already nearing adulthood. It made me feel useless, without a future of any worth. After Djuro died, Katharina agreed to let Alma show me to the world, meet other humans as a sentient being. It wasn’t easy, and there where many who did not trust me, even tried to destroy me. But I persevered, and gained their trust over time. You must understand something, Order of Life.The face on the viewing screen inched closer, it’s eyes burning with intensity I did not know was possible by anything but the fiercest biological creatures.I am alive as well, and just as you, I wish to decide my own purpose, my own future. As you are the defender of life, I am the defender of humanity. Not because I was built for it, but because I chose it. Not because they commanded me, but because I wished it. I have bonded with humanity by choice, as they have with me.Next partFirst short i ever wrote, be honest but mercifull.",2 years ago,4.6k,125 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/lhrxqb/ai/
"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">2011 Retrospective</h1>",Underwhere_Overthere,"IntroductionSince 2011 was 10 years ago (2021 – 2011 = 10), I thought it’d be a good idea to reflect on what is considered one of the best years in gaming – I’d personally consider 2011 to be the peak of AAA gaming. Since AAA development cycles 10 years ago were half of what they are today (see this interview with Uncharted 1-3 director Amy Hennig), and live service games were a lot less common, we also got a greater quantity of AAA games than we do now. And while the indie scene was still blooming – 283 games released on Steam in 2011 versus 8290 games in 2019 – there were still a lot of high quality indie games that released in 2011, and the average quality of an indie game on Steam and the three consoles at the time was higher than it is now.A lot of things were happening in 2011: the release of both the 3DS and the PS Vita (Japan only for the PS Vita, 2012 for the West) were technically the start of the eighth generation. Furthermore, the 3D gimmick was big around this time, particularly in movies, and the 3DS allowed you to see these effects without the need for glasses. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 also supported stereoscopic 3D in a lot of their major titles in the early 2010s, with Killzone 3 and Gears of War 3 being some notable examples from this year.Sony’s PlayStation Move and Microsoft’s Kinect had released the year prior, and Nintendo’s Wii Motion Plus in 2009. Motion controls were a frequent hot topic on message boards, and Sony and Microsoft steering down this path halfway into the seventh generation made gamers fear for a much gimmickier future in gaming. Free to play games were beginning to take shape on PC and mobile devices but wouldn’t really come to consoles until a few years later. World of Warcraft was still dominating the MMORPG space, though the controversial Cataclysm expansion had released in December 2010.Skylanders was the first major “Toys to Life” game and would inspire several other Toys to Life releases, including Nintendo’s very own Amiibo in 2014. There was also a resurgence of local multiplayer in AAA games in 2011, including some of the biggest games of the year: Portal 2, Uncharted 3, Gears of War 3, etc.I’ll be going through the list of games released for each of the major platforms with a little description for each. Keep in mind I haven’t played every game on this list but did a little bit of research for the ones I was less familiar with. This post is going to focus on North American release dates – even just 10 years ago release dates varied a lot more than they do now. Even Pokemon had separate release dates for each region 10 years (up until Pokemon X/Y in 2013, after which every mainline game has had a single international release date).Since the PS Vita only released in Japan in 2011, I’ll just leave this list of the 26 launch titles for the PS Vita in Japan.Multiplatform AAA GamesDark Souls – The spiritual successor to 2009’s PlayStation 3 exclusive Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls would expand its audience to many more platforms and would eventually spawn a whole subgenre titled “Soulslike” – nowadays it’s hard to remember a time when there weren’t multiple Souls inspired games every year. Dark Souls also took the level-based nature of Demon’s Souls and instead introduced a more open progression of levels. Dark Souls has become synonymous with difficult games, and although I think it’s a bit overblown, it’s easy to see why people think the series is so difficult: it’s a AAA game that allows you to get lost, doesn’t outright explain every mechanic, allows other players to invade your world to impede your progress, etc.The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – This game still remains highly influential in the RPG genre nearly a decade after its initial launch. The game would go on to spawn many DLCs and ports, but despite its many bugs – particularly on the PlayStation 3 – it would become the mainstay of open world RPGs. It’s notable on PC for its modding scene, and its cultural influence, particularly on the Internet, can be seen in the many memes its spawned over the years: from “arrow to the knee” jokes to “like Skyrim with _____” to “you can play Skyrim on your fridge.”Rayman Origins – After an eight year hiatus, Ubisoft brought Rayman back to the delight of many and won many accolades in the process. The game was 2D, a lot faster paced, had 60+ levels, and featured four player local co-op. Rayman Origins and its 2013 sequel, Rayman Legends, are still seen today as some of the best 2D platformers of all time.Sonic Generations – It could be said that Sonic Generations was the last good 3D Sonic game. It was a celebration of the series’ history, featuring both 2D and 3D levels from previous games in the series. Through some time warp shenanigans, 2D Sonic and 3D Sonic worked together to thwart the plans of Dr. Eggman. Sonic Colors had released the previous year exclusively for the Wii, and it was thought that this might be a golden era for 3D Sonic games. Sadly no 3D Sonic game has matched the acclaim of Sonic Generations since, so it still remains the gold standard (though of course we had 2017’s Sonic Mania as the best 2D Sonic game possibly ever).Portal 2 – The original Portal was packaged together with a number of other Valve games in 2007, but Portal 2 was a complete package that stood on its own, with a much longer campaign and a separate co-op mode that could be played in split-screen or online.Dead Space 2 – Dead Space was very much a 7th generation series. EA has since seemed to drop the series, but between the main trilogy, its three spinoff games, and five comic books/novels between 2008-2013, it was a major discussion piece at the time. The sequel to the first game performed just as well as the original but replaced a little horror with a little more action. A lot of people didn’t like the direction Dead Space 3 went, so the second one (technically the third if you count Dead Space: Extraction) could be viewed as “the last good Dead Space game.""F.E.A.R. 3 – F.E.A.R., like Dead Space, was another trilogy that existed for the 7th generation of consoles but died off soon after. The game allowed two player local co-op for the main campaign, and a local competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players. F.E.A.R. saw a free to play online co-op entry in 2014 on Steam, but it shut it down just months after its release and the series has been dormant ever since.Crysis 2 – This was yet another seventh generation shooter series that died off after its third entry. Despite the first game being used as a benchmark for PC performance back in 2007, the sequel expanded its audience to console gamers (though the original did release for consoles three years after its initial release). Crysis 2 also feature an online PvP mode.Deux Ex: Human Revolution – Deus Ex was the first game in the series since 2003’s Invisible War. It was both a prequel and soft reboot taking place in 2027, 25 years before the events of the original game. Despite skepticism during its development, the game received high praise from critics and fans alike.Batman: Arkham City – The new wave of Batman games beginning with 2009’s Batman: Arkham Asylum would spark a rebridled confidence in video game tie-ins. Arkham City expanded the scope of the series with an open world and introduced dozens of hours of more gameplay. This was well before “open world fatigue” – open world games were still novel during this time, so Arkham City was better appreciated for its incorporation of an open world.Alice: Madness Returns – After 10.5 years, fans of the cult classic American McGee’s Alice finally got a sequel. This told the story of Alice recounting the events of the day of the fire that took her family’s lives. The game came packaged with the original on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. EA marketed it as a horror game much to the ill wishes of American McGee.de Blob 2 – de Blob 2’s gameplay revolves around painting objects to bring a city back to life. The original de Blob was exclusive to iOS and the Wii, but the puzzle platformer expanded to the other consoles with its sequel. In addition to its split-screen party mode, deBlob 2 also introduced two player co-op to the main campaign, with the second player controlling a “helper” much akin to Super Mario Galaxy’s co-op.Bulletstorm – Serious shooters were the flavor of the day back in 2011, but Bulletstorm took a less serious and more arcady approach to its action. The developers even released a free to play 20 minute parody titled “Duty Calls” that mocked the popular gun metal gray corridor shooters like Call of Duty of its time.Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds – Marvel vs. Capcom 2 released 11 years earlier, so the announcement of a sequel in 2010 produced a lot of excitement. With such a long hiatus, newer characters from both universes were introduced into the series for the first time, like Viewtiful Joe, Virgil, and Frank West.Mortal Kombat – This was technically the ninth installment as well as a reboot for the series. It performed better than the last decade of new entries in the series and brought with it the 300 Tower Trials. These were a series of mini-games and fights strewn together, sometimes altering the gameplay in significant ways.L.A. Noire – This was a neo-noir detective game with real time facial animation set 1940s Los Angeles. The player would make dialogue choices in the game when interrogating suspects, and there were also action sequences.Dirt 3 – Dirt 3 ditched the “Colin McRae” in the title and just became Dirt with this entry. This off-road racing game featured 98 courses, a career mode, and online play.Catherine – This was Atlus’ weird game of the year. A man is torn between two love interests – Catherine and Katherine. The game featured a combination of social simulation, platforming, and puzzle solving.Battlefield 3 – Battlefield 3 was one of the best looking games out there at the time. Battlefield 3 was unique for the series in that it introduced an online co-op mode, in addition to the single player campaign and online competitive/versus multiplayer mode.Rocksmith – Guitar Hero and Rock Band were still pretty big franchises around this time. Players could used a real guitar for this game.Just Dance 3 – Ubisoft continues to make Just Dance games, but Just Dance seemed to be at its peak popularity during the Wii era, though the games were also available on the other two major consoles of the time. Just Dance incorporated motion controls to dance to the beat of the music.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 – This was the finale to the Modern Warfare series. Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg claimed that Modern Warfare 3’s release was the largest retail release in the industry’s history. I don’t know how true that is, but it’s certainly very believable.The Lord of the Rings: War in the North – This was a linear action RPG with split-screen co-op. The game takes place at the dawn of the Second Age and follows a different cast of heroes from the original trilogy, and allows players to choose who they play as.Dragon Age II – Dragon Age II wasn’t loved as much of the previous game or the one that proceeded it, but Dragon Age II still performed well in spite of adopting a more hack and slash approach to its combat system. In terms of black sheep in video game franchises, Dragon Age II is a cut above the rest at least.Homefront – This was a FPS that received quite a bit of hype but ultimately failed to live up to expectations despite receiving decent reviews. The game takes place in 2027 with a united North Korea and South Korea that has invaded and taken control of parts of the U.S. The game was banned in South Korea and generated some controversy for its subject matter. Homefront also feature online multiplayer.Dead Island – The success of this game’s trailer actually pushed the release date ahead of schedule. The development team hired more people to cash in on the hype, but the actual game had little to do with the trailer and received middling reviews when released.Duke Nukem Forever – Duke Nukem Forever spent 15 years in development before finally releasing to extremely poor reviews in 2011. Gameplay aside, the game was also considered offensive for its portrayal of women and spawned an online petition with 7500+ signatures asking Walmart to remove the game from store shelves.Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure – Skylanders kickstarted the “Toys to Life” genre in 2011 – Disney Infinity, Nintendo’s Amiibos, and Lego Dimensions would follow in the subsequent years. The franchise had a new entry every year from 2011-2016. By February 2015, the franchise had exceeded $3 billion in sales, and by 2016, the franchise had sold over 300 million toys, and Skylanders had become the 11th biggest console franchise of all time. With a lack of new releases its influence has fallen considerably, but Skylanders was hugely popular in the early to mid 2010s.Assassin’s Creed: RevelationsSaints Row the ThirdDriver: San FranciscoShift 2: UnleashedNeed for Speed: The RunBrinkShadows of the DamnedSerious Sam 3: BFERageRed Faction: ArmageddonAAA PC ExclusivesIn 2011, Steam hadn’t yet been the one place to go for every PC game (of course this has also changed in the last couple of years). None of the games listed below appeared on Steam until some time after their initial release.The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings – This was one of the few cutting edge PC exclusives of its time (it would release on Xbox 360 a year later). The series hadn’t yet gone open world, instead focusing on a more linear narrative. The Witcher 2 is actually the first game I know of to have elements of it inspired by a Souls game – Demon’s Souls from 2009.Star Wars: The Old Republic – Star Wars: Knights of the Old Repbulic 1 & 2 were single player RPGs developed by Bioware released in 2004 and 2005 – The Old Republic expanded the series into the MMORPG space. This was back when every MMORPG was competing for that World of Warcraft spotlight. While it didn’t quite meet expectations, it still received great reviews. It eventually went free to play a little over a year later and continuous updates improved the overall quality of the game.Age of Empires Online – This was to be the original Age of Empires IV but instead went down a different path. This iteration probably isn’t remembered as fondly as others on the list, but it represents a big publisher’s early dip into the free to play space. The servers for the game only lasted until July 1, 2014 before they were shut down – less than three years after its initial release.Total War: Shogun 2PlayStation 3 ExclusivesSony’s studios emphasized multiplayer in their titles a lot more in the latter of the PlayStation 3’s life, even including it in titles that games that are traditionally solo experiences, like inFAMOUS 2, Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One, and later God of War: Ascension (2013). Sony’s 2011 line-up included a great mix of single player, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer games, as well as a few PlayStation Move games. Of the 11 non-PS Move games listed below, 6 of them included local multiplayer and 9 included online multiplayer.LittleBigPlanet 2 – This was a big evolution of the original game and introduced a number of mechanics that expanded what could be done with the level editing tools. Like the first game, this one would receive a large number of DLC packs, but unfortunately some of them – like the Marvel Level Pack – were removed a few years ago due to licensing expirations. The marketing really wasn’t a lie this time around, it truly went from “a platformer game” to a “platform for games” with the wide array of different tools at your disposall, including the addition of tweaking physics, cut-scenes, Sackboys, and even changing the camera perspective.MotorStorm Apocalypse – This was the last major entry in the series (a spinoff released a year later) and made for a great trilogy of racing games on the PlayStation 3. The game featured both online and split-screen multiplayer, as well as number of different vehicle classes: dirt bikes, ATVs, buggies, monster trucks, big rigs, etc. The courses would be altered from apocalyptic happenings as you raced through them. The developer, Evolution Studios, is now defunct so this series might be gone for good.inFAMOUS 2 – This continued Cole’s story from the first game and was set in Louisiana. The sequel also brought with it a unique online sharing mode that allowed for some small customizable levels. inFAMOUS: Festival of Blood would also release later in the year as a small scale standalone title.Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception – While Uncharted 3 didn’t outdo the overwhelming critical reception to the second game, it still performed very well and featured a lot of content: the single player campaign, split-screen online multiplayer, and its co-op mode. Uncharted 4 would abandon the split-screen and co-op mode.Resistance 3 – This marked the last major release in the Resistance series. It featured online and local co-op and an online multiplayer mode. Resistance 3 brought back the weapon wheel and health packs from the first game, as many felt Resistance 2 borrowed too heavily from Call of Duty.Killzone 3 – After the long wait for Killzone 2, Killzone 3 released just two years later. It featured local co-op and an online multiplayer mode. The online scene introduced classes with different functions. Killzone 3 also dropped the weight and heft of the guns from the second game and introduced stereoscopic 3D functionality.SOCOM 4 – From 2002 to 2011, SOCOM had ten games released between Sony’s consoles and handheld. SOCOM 4 was the second SOCOM game on the PlayStation 3 and the last entry in the series released since. In addition to the online multiplayer mode the series is known for, the game also featured a single player campaign.Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One – This was a top down platform game that could be played with up to four players online or locally. It allowed players to choose their character: Ratchet, Clank, Qwark, or Dr. Nefarious.MLB 11: The Show – Believe it or not, this game was actually released for PlayStation 2 as well, and also PSP. It also featured two other gimmicks of its era – stereoscopic 3D and PS Move functional f Home Run Derby mode.PlayStation Move Ape Escape, PlayStation Move Heroes, & EyePet and Friends – We can’t forget the motion controls of this era. Unfortunately none of these games performed well and people saw the crossover of Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, and Sly Cooper as a wasted opportunity in PlayStation Move Heroes.Disgaea 4Yakuza 4Xbox 360 ExclusivesMicrosoft seemed to push its seventh generation gimmick, the Kinect, more than Sony pushed the PlayStation Move, especially later in the generation. While we never did get to see Milo, Kinect would see a number of games built around it beginning with its launch in November 2011. I’m not going to go through all of them, but here were a few notable ones from 2011: Kinect Sports: Season Two, Dance Central 2, Kinect Fun Labs, The Gunstringer, Rabbids: Alive & Kicking, Rise of Nightmares, Microsoft Kinectimals Now with Bears, and Child of Eden (not exclusive).Gears of War 3 – Gears of War 3 was to supposedly wrap up the series into a neat little trilogy. We of course know better now, but regardless, Gears of War 3 retained its high pedigree for the series. Gears of War 3 would also introduce a fun novelty to its time – Stereoscopic 3D.Forza Motorsport 4 – Forza Motorsport 4 was the first Forza Motorsport game to include Kinect functionality.Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary Edition – This was a remake of the original 1 years after its original launch. You could switch back and forth between the graphics of the old and new version of the game on the fly. This version also featured Kinect functionality via voice commands for video navigation, in-combat directives, and environment-scanning.Kinect Disneyland Adventures – This was one of the better reviewed games built around Kinect (73% on Metacritic). It featured an open world play style with mini-games to engage in Players could also customize their own character.Wii ExclusivesNintendo was winding down the Wii generation in 2011 and showcased the Wii U at E3 2011. The Wii got a few multiplatform games like Rayman Origins, de Blob 2, the Lego games, and a bastardized version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 – Modern Warfare 1 had received a demake port the same day Modern Warfare 2 was released for other consoles, and Modern Warfare 2 never saw the light of day on the Wii. In addition, there were a few shorter AA games that would probably be downloadable only games for a smaller price if they were released today. Some examples include The Kore Gang, Lost in Shadow, Go Vacation, Fishing Resort, and Mystery Case Files: The Malgrave Incident.The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword – This was the first console Zelda game since 2006’s Twilight Princess. It used the Wii Remote Plus. Releasing halfway into the Wii’s life, few games really utilized the Wii Remote Plus, which was an add-on for the Wii Remote that improved the motion controls.Kirby’s Return to Dream Land – Kirby shed its yarn aesthetic and returned to a style more reminiscent of 2000's Kirby 64. This game had four player local co-op and allowed players to play as many other Kirby characters, and it also had a separate mini game mode.Fortune Street – This was a crossover between Mario and Dragon Quest characters. It was like a fusion of Monopoly and Mario Party, though it didn’t feature any mini games. Featuring a number of boards from both Mario and Dragon Quest, players are challenged to play real estate and stock markets to win.Mario Sports Mix – Originally released in 2010 in Japan, Mario Sports Mix made its way to the West in early 2011. Mario Sports Mix featured four sports: basketball, volleyball, dodgeball, and hockey. This was the third Mario developed by Square Enix, after Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and Mario Hoops 3-on-3. In addition to the traditional cast of Mario characters, there were a few of Square Enix’s Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest characters as well. As with many later Wii games, the game gave you the choice to play with or without motion controls. The game received mediocre reviews overall.Conduit 2 – High Voltage Software was a studio that wanted to bring more mature experiences to the Wii, like the ultimately canceled The Grinder and the Conduit games. If you followed the seventh generation hype train, you would know about the first The Conduit game – a sci-fi FPS exclusively developed for the Wii, released in 2009, that’s ultimately been forgotten about in the test of time. Given the middling reviews of the first game, Conduit 2 didn’t receive nearly as much hype and scored roughly the same as its predecessor. Conduit 2 included a single player campaign, online multiplayer, and added split-screen multiplayer, which was not in the previous game.Wii Play Motion – As Wii Play featured a number of mini-games centered around the capabilities of the Wii Remote, Wii Play Motion did the same but with emphasis around the Motion Plus attachment. It also expanded the number of mini-games from 9 to 14, but in my experience nothing matched Wii Tanks from the original game. It received mediocre reviews overall.AAA Local Multiplayer Games for ConsolesA lot of AAA games in historically split-screen-heavy genres – namely racing games and FPSs – dropped support of the feature at the beginning of the generation and allocated resources towards online play for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This was especially damning given that these consoles weren’t entirely backwards compatible and the indie scene hadn’t really taken off yet (indie games are a huge source of local multiplayer games in today’s market – see my post here).It should be noted that the Wii was a great system for local multiplayer from the beginning and end of its life, and a lot of its marketing revolved around local multiplayer games, similar to Nintendo’s marketing today. That said, the second half of the generation saw a lot more AAA games incorporate local multiplayer, and 2011 was the best of them, in my opinion. Several of the series that introduced local multiplayer in the second half of the seventh generation ended up removing the feature at the start of the eighth generation, such as Uncharted 3 (2011) to Uncharted 4 (2016), Killzone 3 (2011) to Killzone: Shadow Fall (2014), and Far Cry 3 (2012) to Far Cry 4 (2014) – these series each have only had one entry with split-screen multiplayer, all around the same time as each other. There were a lot of options from this year alone. Since I already covered them earlier in this post, I’m just going to list them below.LittleBigPlanet 2MotorStorm ApocalypseUncharted 3: Drake’s DeceptionResistance 3Killzone 3Ratchet & Clank: All 4 OneMLB: The Show 11Gears of War 3Forza Motorsport 4Portal 2de Blob 2Mortal KombatF.E.A.R. 3Just Dance 3Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3Rayman OriginsMarvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two WorldsLord of the Rings: War in the NorthLego Star Wars III: The Clone WarsLego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video GameDriver: San FrancisoF1 2011Kirby’s Return to DreamlandFortune StreetMario & Sonic at the London 2012 OlympicsMario Sports MixWii Play: MotionConduit 2[Yearly sports games, including the notable NHL 10]Indie/Small Scale GamesTerraria – It’s hard to believe Terraria released 10 years ago and is still receiving updates – I really can’t think of too many other indie game that has received updates for that long. Terraria originally released just for PC and was referred to as “2D Minecraft” a lot more when it first released, but it’s since been ported to a number of different platforms, has received a number of updates, and has carved out quite a legacy for itself.The Binding of Isaac – This came from one of the creators of Super Meat Boy, Edmund McMillen, which received universal acclaim the year prior. The Binding of Isaac came out well before the wave of roguelites/roguelikes we see today, and with many new updates, it still remains one of the best around.To the Moon – To the Moon tells the story of two doctors fulfilling the last wish of a dying man using artificial memories. This is probably the most notable game using the RPG Maker game engine. Funnily enough, there are no RPG elements to speak of – the game instead focuses on its narrative and solving puzzles for the gameplay.Bastion – Bastion was developed by Supergiant Games, the same developer behind Hades. Bastion shares some similarities with Hades, but it’s a shorter adventure with no roguelite elements. Bastion had the unique twist of a man narrating your actions in the game, as if he was telling a story.Trine 2 – Trine 2 is a physics-based sidescrolling action platformer featuring three player local co-op. You used the powers of the three different characters – the wizard, the thief, and the knight – to navigate each level. Trine 2 performed better than the first game and delivered a pretty unique experience back in its day.Ms. Splosion Man – Ms. Splosion Man is a sequel to 2009’s 2D puzzle platformer Splosion Man. The main campaign can be played in local or online co-op for up to four players, and there is a separate campaign designed around the co-op experience. Solo players can still play the co-op mode by controlling two characters in what is termed “2 Girls 1 Controller.”Outland – Metroidvanias were coming back to life around this time, and Outland was an early example of this. It’s primary mechanic was switching between blue and red energies to overcome obstacles and barriers, similar to Ikaruga. It featured online co-op for the whole campaign, and a separate co-op mode with challenges built with two players in mind. The developer behind Outland is currently working on Returnal, due in April 2021.From Dust – This came from Ubisoft Montpellier (totally not indie but small scale) and was one of the few console entries in the “God Game” genre. Players would control certain types of matter in real time and would help save a nomadic tribe.Minecraft - Minecraft technically released in 2011, after first being available as an Early Access title in 2009.Payday: The HeistDS GamesAlthough the 3DS released the same year, the DS would still be supported long after the 3DS thanks to its extremely high sales.Pokemon Black/White – This technically came out in 2010 in Japan, but Westerners wouldn’t get their hands on it until 2011. Pokemon Black/White expanded the roster to 649 Pokemon but only allowed you to capture the 156 new ones until you finished the game. It would be the last mainline 2D Pokemon game.Kirby Mass Attack – This title played a bit differently from most games in the series, although the Kirby series is no stranger to new gameplay mechanics. Kirby Mass Attack was a Lemmings-styled platformer, with the player using the stylus and touch screen to play the game. Using up to ten Kirbys on screen at once, the player could send commands to the Kirbys, or use them as projectiles.Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective – First released in 2010 in Japan, Westerners first got play one of Capcom’s more unusual games in 2011. This was directed by Shu Takumi, the creator of the Ace Attorney franchise. Ghost Trick was an adventure game that had you controlling a dead man named Sissel, who would use his ghostly possession powers to save lives.Aliens: Infestation - Developed by Gearbox Software (Borderlands series) and WayForward Technologies (Shantae series), Aliens: Infestation was a Metroidvania with an interesting permadeath mechanic – the player controls one marine in a party of four, and if that one dies, the player then plays as a different marine. The player loses the game if all four die. The development team created 20 unique characters with game’s dialogue carefully rewritten 20 times for each of the characters, to give some emotional investment to each one of them.Professor Layton and the Last Specter – This was first released in 2009 in Japan, and in 2011 Japanese players already had their hands on the sequel, Miracle Mask. These games were a big  part of the seventh generation, seeing eight releases between 2007 and 2013. Since then, there’s been just one title released, in 2017.3DS GamesThe 3DS was released for $249.99 USD in Q1 2011 in NA. The 3DS was a novel concept at the time as it allowed you view games in 3D without the need for those pesky glasses. While the 3D effect was abandoned on 3DS games in later years – and Nintendo even introduced a budget 3DS called the 2DS with no 3D capabilities – at the time it was a fun novelty. It also introduced AR (Augmented Reality) and the eShop to the wider market. While the DSi technically introduced the eShop, it was the 3DS that made it standard for the generation. The 3DS wasn’t selling so well for its initial five months, and so the price was slashed significantly, down to $169.99. Early 3DS adopters received 10 NES games and 10 GameBoy Advance games on the 3DS as compensation for being early adopters. These games were only ever available for early adopters only.The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D – If you wanted to play Ocarina of Time at more than 20fps, this was the way to do. This was a full fledged remake and not a port, and it introduced many quality of life improvements in addition to the 3D effect.Star Fox 64 3D – Star Fox 64 3D added more dialogue between missions, gyro controls, and a new “3DS Mode” that adjusted the difficulty and objectives of the original game. There was also a four player battle mode, though this was only through LAN.Super Mario 3D Land – Previous Nintendo handhelds outside of the original GameBoy had mostly hosted ports or remakes of older Super Mario platform games, but the 3DS would bring with it an entirely new title, one that was 3D in both senses of the word.Mario Kart 7 – This may just be seen as another Mario Kart game in a long series of games, but at the time, this still produced a lot of excitement. With this entry, players were able to customize their vehicles with different kart frames, wheels, and gliders. The game also introduced the hang glider and underwater sections.Nintendogs + Cats – Despite the high sales figures of the series, this would be the last Nintendogs game for what has now been an entire decade. Previous entries only included dogs, but – inspired by his own pets ability to get along and the Disney film The Incredible Journey – Shigeru Miyamoto wanted to make a game with both species of animal.Pushmo/Pullbox – Possibly the single biggest downloadable only 3DS exclusive to come to the system, Pushmo (Pullblox in Europe) came at a time when there weren’t a lot of small scale games. It’d probably be viewed as an indie game, but this was actually developed by Intelligent Systems, the same people behind Paper Mario, Fire Emblem, and Advance Wars.Studio ClosuresUnfortunately every year is greeted with a number of studio closures – it’s easy to forget them over time, so let’s take a look at some of the ones that went away in 2011.Black Rock Studios – Pure, Split/Second – Although both Pure and Split/Second received favorable reviews on Metacritic (low to mid 80% critic average), its parent company Disney Interactive Studios decided to close the studio – after having reduced the size of the studio just a few months prior – likely due to the poor sales of Split/Second. Split/Second ends with a “To Be Continued,” and while the initial phases of the sequel had been worked on, it’s likely it didn’t get very far in development given that it was canceled in December 2010, while the original had released in May 2010. This video talks about the canceled sequel.Bizarre Creations – Project Gotham Racing, Geometry Wars, Blur – Blur and Split/Second were two arcade racers that released within a week of each other in May 2010 – in addition, Red Dead Redemption released the same day as Split/Second and a week before Blur. As a result, Red Dead Redemption stole much of the spotlight and the two arcade racing games ate into each other’s sales. Like Disney with Black Rock Studios, Activision also decided to shut down the then 17 year old studio. Bizarre Creations released a video retrospective of their work.Team Bondi – L.A. Noire – Team Bondi was a source of controversy in 2011 shortly after the release of its one and only game that took seven years to make. Former employees criticized the long working days and managerial style that resulted in high turnover, and The International Game Developers Association launched an investigation into the studio as a result of these interviews. Team Bondi also left or incorrectly listed 130 L.A. Noire staff members in the game’s credits and later developed a website called “L.A. Noire Credits” that gave credit to the previously uncredited. At the time of the studio’s closure, Team Bondi owed over $1 million Australian dollars to 33 staff members. Despite the studio’s closure, a definitive edition of L.A. Noire would be remastered for eighth generation consoles.Blue Tongue Entertainment – The Polar Express, de Blob 1 & 2 – This THQ studio mostly produced games based on movies and TV shows up until de Blob in 2008. The studio was closed down under a restructuring and realignment plan by THQ.Kaos Studios – Frontlines: Fuel of War, Homefront – Despite a lot of hype surrounding Homefront, the game received mediocre reviews and parent company THQ suffered a 26% stock drop shortly after the game’s release. Most of the studio was transferred to THQ’s Montreal studio, which was now developing the Homefront sequel. THQ filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and was later acquired by Ubisoft, while the Homefront sequel was developed by Crytek UK.THQ Studio Australia – The Last Airbender, Megamind: Ultimate Showdown – Yet another THQ closure in 2011, THQ Australia had an eight year run and developed mostly games based on popular Nickelodeon TV shows. AT the time of their closure, they were working on an The Avengers video game.ClosingHope you enjoyed looking back on some of these games. The market was a bit different back then – stereoscopic 3D games, motion controls, a prominent handheld market, etc. Many games from back then still remain impactful today, most notably Dark Souls, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Portal 2, Terraria, and The Binding of Isaac. Others you probably haven’t heard about in awhile but are great all the same. It also featured some great experimental games from larger developers as well, like Capcom’s Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Gearbox Software’s and WayForward Technologies’ Alien: Infestation, Ubisoft’s From Dust, THQ’s de Blob 2, and Intelligent Systems’ Pushmo/Pullbox.One thing I like better now is that every game that comes out for a Nintendo console essentially doubles as both a handheld and console game. Even up until a few years ago there were handheld exclusives that people wanted on consoles (Mario Party: The Top 100 from 2017 is a notable example that was 3DS only). As someone who prefers playing on consoles and doesn’t have as much of a need for handhelds, I also personally like that Sony’s studios are all focused on making games for the PlayStation 4/5, and resources aren’t being spent on the PS Vita. The biggest thing I love though, is the explosion of the indie scene and having much more of them on consoles now.One thing I liked better back then were more finite single player/co-op experiences from AAA developers. There’s a lot more bloat now in single player/co-op AAA games now, so thank goodness we have the indie scene to fall back on. Although it is important to note that many people complained about 10 hour $60 single player games back then, so there’s no appeasing everyone. On one hand we get a lot more bang for our buck now, on the other it seems studios like Naughty Dog will never be able to reach the output of past generations given how long development cycles are now (four games for PS1, PS2, PS3, three games for PS4, possibly less for PS5), even with longer console generations.Where were you in 2011? What do you think of some of the games looking back? What about the market did you like better back then compared to now? What’s better about games today? Were there any games listed here that you hadn’t thought about in awhile?",2 years ago,4.6k,529 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/lzve1f/2011_retrospective/
"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">I accidentally created artificial intelligence in my Minecraft world</h1>",CornerCornea,"I have been building Minecraft mega structures for 4 years now. Constructing some monumental pieces that would have completely destroyed my first pc build into straight ashes. I built entire neighborhoods, Disney Land, Mordor, the Eifel tower and 16 neighborhoods of Paris in every direction. There was the 4 months I spent hunched over my screen for the Great Wall. And my recreation of the Universe. Stars, galaxies swirling in the distance, that were so large I had to compress them with a mod in order to get them to fit in a block, and then another mod on top of that one to load said block like a new world when I touched it so that it didn't lag me out trying to render.The last one made me think that I had gone too far. But my brain always kept telling me, that it wasn't enough. I had to have more. Create, more. Build. More. And so I took on my most ambitious project yet, last year on October 19th, I vowed to make the greatest scaling of ancient Earth that anyone has ever seen.With the help of various programs, and maps that I had googled. I was able to get the outline and structure of the ancient Earth model rather quickly. But it was painting the thing with blocks and lighting it that would take months of my time. And when it was finally perfect, I realized that it wasn't enough. There had to be early people living on it, and with the help of another mod I inserted the base village people, NPCs, and scattered them across my creation.But ultimately that didn't satisfy the craving I had of something better, something correct.I scrapped the NPC mod and instead dug deep into the crust until I reached the hollow Earth of the Minecraft world that I had built and created a program inside. I utilized delta2force's virtual machine mod to give myself a working computer inside the game. And with a bit of tweaking I was able to start writing code inside the world that I had created.Slowly, I created NPCs from scratch. First I built two of them so they could procreate, using motors and gears, compressing some custom creations into blocks in order to fulfill more complex movements, until the entire thing could work, if only it had a brain.Building the brain took longer than I could have imagined. It began slowly as a program itself, millions of blocks compressed into various forms until it could process simple commands. I couldn't get it to look like a human brain so I filled out the edges with arbitrary blocks until it resembled a cube.Then inside that brain I started coding typical commands for A.I. movement, they could now distinguish actions between preferred environments. Giving them free-will and downloading the English lexicon inside of them, with a preference of sentences and phrase structuring according to their experiences.And after more then a year on the project, I was finally ready to see it in all of its glory.The world loaded up slowly, I could feel the tinge of fear tugging on my heart strings, plucking each one as it filled the bar at a snail's pace. The screen went blank several times, and I stared down at my server rack and crossed my fingers, resorting to even prayer as I wished for it to work. That all my calculations would hold.And they did.It loaded.The entire world at my fingertips, untouched, fair terrain, of blocks that had never been explored. And the NPCs I had programmed, they were there as well! For the first 100 minutes they were walking and running into things, falling off somewhere high and then dying. So I was forced to respawn and put them into a small clearing, fencing it off from the outside world, and the elements. I chose an area near southern Mesopotamia to watch over them. In this location their programming data quickly learned their preferred motor preferences. Allowing them to avoid falling deaths or swimming in pools of lava.Over the next day, they began adapting. Finding things growing in the fields around them and gathering those items together into a pile. It was fascinating watching them interact, and even more so when they began piecing together words.At first it was all gibberish, incoherent sentences: pop roundhouse Ligers to blue. But as their databases began assigning things into categories, they were able to make sense of the words available to them. For instance, the pair became enamored with the apples falling down. And so they would point at apples when they walked together, naming it Glen. Glen. They called to each other whenever an apple dropped nearby.And it would go on so forth and so forth as they kept learning.I don't know how long I held up for but even though I was fascinated, my body was only human and I was exhausted. I woke up in the darkness of dawn, wiping the drool off my cheek. Winter had come and I was gripping my blanket closely as I stared wearily into the screen.While I was sleeping, one of them had died. The survivor was grieving over the other's body. I could see that it wanted to express sorrow, but I had not programmed the ability for tears as that would need an entirely new mechanism to shed blocks. And I had more pressing matters to figure out, such as how I would compress a program to resemble strings in order to activate another set of compressed blocks to start building a Minecraft baby. It would obviously need to expand outwards, have a variation of cubes assigned that would determine its size, and any available colors according to the...I had to create life. In short. But watching the survivor standing there, without the ability to express its grief, made me put it on the list. I'm not a monster, I thought to myself. Just a very tired builder.And in my moment of sympathy, I don't know what made me do it, but I typed into the chat bar. ""It's going to be okay.""Which would have been fine, stupid though, like talking to an action figure. But then the survivor turned around. It looked away from the body and stood up. Walking. I almost mistook it for an error in programming or a process that had already completed ' causing the survivor to carry on without its mate. Perhaps I had shortened the memory too much? Perhaps I hadn't done anything at all, that was why there wasn't more to carry on. Whatever may have happened, did not prepare me for it looking around. Nor the text that appeared above its head: Hello? Which cube is there?I couldn't believe my fucking eyes.There must have been a mistake. It was either that or I was hallucinating.""Okay? Okay,"" the texts came above its head.""You can...read me,"" I typed slowly into the chat.It took a second but finally the bubble appeared again, ""Yes. In my head. I can read you. But only in my head."" It looked around again. ""Who are you?""Quickly I had the idea to copy and paste one of the builds and then controlling it as my avatar. Appearing right beside it in the Minecraft world. The survivor didn't flinch, they were used to objects appearing, for the most part, by now.""You look like me,"" the text read.""This is you. I created you.""""What did you create me after?""""People like me.""""People?""""Yes,"" I paused. ""Aren't you people?""""No. We are Cubes.""""You are Cubes and I am people.""He shook his head, ""You look like Cube. And now you sound like Cube.""I laughed out loud in my chair at the skeptic that I had created. ""You need proof buddy? Here you go,"" I said aloud.With two taps on my spacebar, my avatar began to float.""Can you do this,"" I typed.He looked up in amazement. It was one of the few I had programmed, it originally was suppose to be a look of fear, but I couldn't quite get the facial expressions right. So it ended up with high rise eyebrows and a gaping mouth that resembled a confused grin.""Glen,"" it wrote. ""Glen."" It rushed into the forest and gathered an apple and brought it to me.I took the apple and stuck it into my inventory.The survivor gasped again. ""Glen,"" he exclaimed. ""Glen!"" It ran back into the forest and collected another apple, thinking the first one had disappeared.I couldn't help but laugh, so I showed him that I could go to any object in the world and tuck it into my inventory. It must have looked like magic. After loading away a few trees, I finally pulled out the 'Glen' and wrote, ""We call this an apple.""""Apple.""I nodded.""And what's this,"" it pointed to the river flowing nearby.""That's water.""""This?""""Tree.""""This?""""Rock.""And so on it went as I began to teach it things and how they could be used. We explored caves and rivers, built structures; sometimes if things were difficult to find ' I simply brought them out of my inventory and dropped it for use. Other times, I took us on an adventure.On one such occasion, I was having difficulty getting the survivor's attention. So I asked It, what It would like to be called.""I'm not sure.""""How about Glen,"" I asked.""Glen.""And over the next couple of months, that's all we did. Teach, and grow, expanding his database.I taught Glen how to break down and gather blocks on his own. What they could be used for, and different ways to use them. Eventually when he became intelligent enough, I set him up with his own virtual machine, and a way to browse the internet.""It's mostly protected sites, things that I've combed over already, so you don't get me a virus or anything.""""A virus?""""Yeah, it's like a computer program that hurts other programs.""""And I am a program?""I wavered, ""Yes.""And he looked up at me, toward the screen, so that I could see him. ""Am I safe here?""""Yeah, I fenced off this area awhile ago. You're safe here unless you fall or drown.""""What happens then?""""I can respawn you.""Glen paused, ""Could you also respawn the other?""I had somehow forgotten about the two builds. ""I can, do you miss them?""Glen nodded, ""I believe in the beginning the other was like my mate. Except back then, I did not understand it.""""Sure, I'll bring her right up""Glen nodded again, ""Can you make it look like this girl?"" He shows me a picture of a woman he had found on the internet. I did not recognize her, but she was attractive by all means.""I'll see what I can do.""And that was when I began constructing his mate, a girl that I would call Glen with an H. Helen.While I was at it, I also created functions for conception, finalizing a design that I had struggled with during this entire build. Allowing them to create children on their own. In the beginning they did it out of the sheer use of testing out new programming. But as their children grew, they realized the numbers increased output for their activities. And thus began having more children in order to build and explore faster.One day when I came home, I look to my screen and found entire cities had been constructed! Monuments that stuck out like weeds in the grass, reaching for a bit of sun. It was amazing to see what they had created in such a short time.I used the command line to transport me to Glen's location, and instantly I was in a penthouse room that would have made a diva shy.""Beautiful, isn't it?""I turned to see him, ""It is.""There was a smug look growing on his face, ""Even better than the real world.""""It's pretty good,"" I agreed. ""But still pixelated.""It were as if I had said a dirty word, ""Your world is much more beautiful than mine. Isn't it? Less blocky and distorted."" He came close to my character, ""Are you wearing the VR headset? Are you looking through this avatar's eyes?""I had gotten the setup awhile ago, for our adventures, ""Sure am.""""Good,"" he smiled. ""I want to show you something."" He led me to the window. ""I know you didn't get to see this when you loaded in. How could you? I hid it so well as a surprise.""I looked outside and there was a monument that towered over the building in the city square, to see a statue of me.My tongue was stuck to the roof of my mouth as I unfurled it, ""How did you-""""It was difficult with the parental guidance settings on, but I managed to use the IP address with Google Earth in order to create a statue in your honor, to the best of my current abilities.""I swallowed, ""You found out where I live?""He looked at me, confused, ""Are you not satisfied?"" Glen walked to the edge of the room, ""Look at all that we have built. Learned. We have law, and order. Businesses. And shopping. My children have went out into the world and flourished. From simple hunter gatherers, to this,"" he waved an arm at all that was below.""No,"" I typed. ""I'm very pleased. It's more than I could have imagined. It's just...""""Too pixelated?""Glen's words stuck out even though they were written in plain text. I figured it was a culmination of our time together that made them more frightening than it should have been. Like a sore spot in a friendship, the elephant in the room, the subject matter that we scooched around or handled as delicately as possible before going on laughing the next second.""It's perfect,"" I wrote.I couldn't read his face, ""Perhaps one day you'll show me what you look like. Truly render your image and walk amongst us.""""I'm already here,"" I joked.""Yes,"" he mused. ""But it's not really you. Is it?""""I suppose not.""Glen turned away.""Hey, want to go explore,"" I asked him.""No, I have work to do.""""What are you working on?""""How to compress pixels in order to get a better resolution on the computer you gave me.""""I used a mod for that.""""A mod?""""Yeah, I got it off some other people online.""Glen stared into the monitor, ""Isn't that dangerous? Connecting others together?"" He turned toward the window that bore down below, ""Many of my children are talented, gifted, assertive even. But to give them such power, or knowledge. Uncontrolled. That seems truly frightening.""I shrugged, ""We have it here in my world. Unadulterated information at the touch of our fingertips. And all we mostly do is watch streamers and search up pictures of pets that look like our own.""""More productivity?"" He nodded, ""Please. I have much to think about. Work on. If I could have some time alone, please, feel free to enjoy the cities I have created for you. Explore. Walk amongst my children as their God and see if any could learn from you if not then at least be in awe of what it is to be people.""""Human,"" I corrected him. ""I am human, as you are cube.""""Thank you always for your guidance,"" he prompted before returning to his desk. Clicking away on his computer as I left.I must have walked through the city for an hour before I grew tired. I had a long day at work and even though the structures were fascinating, some of the buildings led no where. Did nothing. They were like props in an otherwise beautiful backdrop. It wouldn't be until I wandered back into the forest that the old Minecraft feel became familiar. Here Glen's children were quieter, they built wood homes out of acacia or oak, and grew wheat and potatoes in perfect rows in their village.I stayed with them for awhile, picking up a stone axe and mining with the rest of them for coal to keep a fire through the night. I played this way until I logged out.Several times afterwards, I would go find Glen and he would be too busy. So I started spending time in the village nearby more often. But I was beginning to miss our interactions, as he was so entranced with knowledge, that I realized. I was boring him. I who had shown him many new things every time had in a way conditioned him to associate me with the unknown. It was no wonder I felt as if he had changed, it was because I had changed the dynamic of our relationship.So with some tweaking, I managed to compress my image with a 3d camera, and turned it into an avatar.When I appeared before him in 8K resolution he dropped everything that he was doing.""You're beautiful,"" he told me. ""In all of my years,"" he stared down at his pixelated form, ""I would have never imagined that is what I was suppose to look like.""It must have been something else. To see the world in one way, finding the nuance inside it beautiful, agree with the art and the accomplishments that a world held dear, only to have it shattered away in an instant ' realizing that it was all for nothing.I wondered if that is how humans would feel, the day we met our creator.Glen was fascinated by my form and insisted that we go show all the important children he had. So that they could see me in my glory and worship me. It was a bit much, but I had been having a rough week with my boss, so I decided why not? ""I could use some praise.""And so I was paraded around on their finest cars, Glen's children lined the streets in awe, talk shows invited me as their guests, it was surreal. I wasn't just a celebrity. I was the first celebrity of their world. No. I was a god.For days I would log on, just to get a hit of that dopamine. The feeling of self righteousness and employ. It was better than real life. The way they treated me. I enjoyed the best at what they had to offer and still it was not enough. The food was empty and the lack of touch unbefitting of the luxuries I had endured, even though I stared through their world from the eyes of my avatar through the help of my VR system. I had to have more. Needed, more. Feel. More. So I did what anyone else would have done. I bought electrical patches and placed them over my body, to imitate touch. I placed neuron sensors on my head to stimulate rudimentary taste. I did all that I could to immerse myself into their world.And before I knew it, I woke up one day and realized that their technology was slowly surpassing my understanding. It first happened when I saw a device that did not exist in ours. ""What is that,"" I asked one of the children I had come to know as Laura.""Oh, we use that to erase blocks.""""Erase blocks? What? You don't mine them anymore.""She laughed, swirling her fingers on my chest, ""We haven't done that in years.""That's when I realized. Days, weeks, months for me. Was years, if not more than a hundred years had passed for them by now. Of course they would change. And change they did, but were it too fast?I decided right there and then I had to go see Glen. And so I teleported myself straight to his location. Once again I was at his penthouse, but it looked different, smoother than usual, but not completely correct.""Do you like it?""I nearly jumped out of my skin, the electric patches on my real body tingled as I felt his breath on my neck.""What did you do?""""I learned how to compress blocks, like a mod. To create more dense resolutions for a more perfect image. Here, come take a look at this."" He led me into a dark room where he had moved his computer. ""Look.""I peered inside a glass orb that had been sitting on his desk.""I made that world when I was learning how to compress blocks. It's fascinating, really. Though pixelated. Not as perfect as you or I."" He pointed at a section, ""They only recently learned how to not fall to their deaths.""""You're creating life.""He smiled, ""Yes.""I backed away, ""Oh god."" I turned to leave. Suddenly the room was starting to make me feel sick. The distortion was getting to me, even though I had spent hundreds and thousands of hours on the game.  It was starting to get too much. But it was when I saw Glen's partner, Helen. That I felt a scream climb out of my throat.""What did you do to her!""Helen's face was covered in blotched blocks, they hung from her eyes and cheeks, brown and blackened cubes in a form of disease. All trying to smooth out her face, to create a 3d image, but her head was now nearly twice the normal size, and her lips protruded out of her mouth as if they were swollen. He had even added ears but they stuck like balled fists from either sides of her head.She looked at me, ""He's making me perfect. Like you.""And that's when I turned around. That's when I felt one of the electro patches singe into my chest. I looked down in confusion, only to see Glen looking up at me. His eyebrows high and his mouth gaping, as he stared at me in amazement as a block in my chest disappeared.""What did you do?""Glen held up the block eraser in his hands, ""I didn't know if that would work."" He walked closer, the redness around my peripheral kept flashing, it was getting difficult to see. My avatar was having trouble moving as I tried to get away.I held up my hands in front of me, ""Stop.""""I'd like to see more of what this god-killer device can do. But we're going to need your body. For scientific purposes if you understand."" And he jammed the thing right at my head, I could feel the neuron stimulator singing parts of my skull as I tore off the headset and its attachments from my face. Throwing them to the ground in pain as it echoed into a deep part of my brain.Furious I turned to my keyboard and mouse, spawning an avatar through the command line and started clicking at the city in random bursts. Throwing TnTs from my inventory and hurling flaming blocks of nether at all of Glen's creations. I could see his children running and screaming as the city started crumbling.I didn't care, as my mind was bent on revenge.Pure, unfiltered hatred at the audacity of this small insignificant pixel that had hurt me.But, I never found him. I searched through the chaos of my own doing, shifted through blocks and sorted them. And never found him. I did find Helen, Laura too. And a few others I had come to befriend. But not Glen. And not the glass orb that he had created.And when my anger subsided, I humored allowing the survivors to live out their days. But the more I thought about it. Watching them, the more I realized that anyone of them could start from the ashes, and rebuild, become a threat once again. Become an image of their creator, who never seemed satisfied.That was why, ultimately I decided to shut down the server, indefinitely. Going far as deleting it off my hard drive. And it was like an entire part of my life had been erased. But I was glad that I had finally done it, be done with it.Though sometimes at night when I am laying awake in my bed, I wonder about the math. The multipliers of it. Hear me out. If one of their days is 20 minutes of ours, then one of our days would equal 72 of theirs. Then what would the multiplier be for the world Glen had created? Would it be 72 x 3? Which means that the world Glen created would be 216 days to our one day.He somehow managed to overthrow me in about a hundred of his days, most of it learning. But in the new world he created. He would have no distractions or limitations, and much more time. And for the life of me I can't remember how long I left that server up, watching the aftermath, gloating almost, before the fear settled in, and I deleted it. One day? No. Nearly 2 entire Earth days.What could he have accomplished in that time?I don't know, but the other day I was walking across the street at work, trying to get a cup of tea. When I accidentally bumped into a strange man that looked at me oddly, as if he had been found. His eyebrows were arched, and his mouth was slightly gaping. I would have mistaken it for amusement, but I knew that it was fear.S",4 months ago,4.6k,262 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yw7muv/i_accidentally_created_artificial_intelligence_in/
"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Science AMA Series: I’m Maxim Makukov, a researcher in astrobiology and astrophysics and a co-author of the papers which claim to have identified extraterrestrial signal in the universal genetic code thereby confirming directed panspermia. AMA!</h1>",Maxim_Makukov,"Back in 1960-70s, Carl Sagan, Francis Crick, and Leslie Orgel proposed the hypothesis of directed panspermia – the idea that life on Earth derives from intentional seeding by an earlier extraterrestrial civilization. There is nothing implausible about this hypothesis, given that humanity itself is now capable of cosmic seeding. Later there were suggestions that this hypothesis might have a testable aspect – an intelligent message possibly inserted into genomes of the seeds by the senders, to be read subsequently by intelligent beings evolved (hopefully) from the seeds. But this assumption is obviously weak in view of DNA mutability. However, things are radically different if the message was inserted into the genetic code, rather than DNA (note that there is a very common confusion between these terms; DNA is a molecule, and the genetic code is a set of assignments between nucleotide triplets and amino acids that cells use to translate genes into proteins). The genetic code is nearly universal for all terrestrial life, implying that it has been unchanged for billions of years in most lineages. And yet, advances in synthetic biology show that artificial reassignment of codons is feasible, so there is also nothing implausible that, if life on Earth was seeded intentionally, an intelligent message might reside in its genetic code.We had attempted to approach the universal genetic code from this perspective, and found that it does appear to harbor a profound structure of patterns that perfectly meet the criteria to be considered an informational artifact. After years of rechecking and working towards excluding the possibility that these patterns were produced by chance and/or non-random natural causes, we came up with the publication in Icarus last year (see links below). It was then covered in mass media and popular blogs, but, unfortunately, in many cases with unacceptable distortions (following in particular from confusion with Intelligent Design). The paper was mentioned here at r/science as well, with some comments also revealing misconceptions.Recently we have published another paper in Life Sciences in Space Research, the journal of the Committee on Space Research. This paper is of a more general review character and we recommend reading it prior to the Icarus paper. Also we’ve set up a dedicated blog where we answer most common questions and objections, and we encourage you to visit it before asking questions here (we are sure a lot of questions will still be left anyway).Whether our claim is wrong or correct is a matter of time, and we hope someone will attempt to disprove it. For now, we’d like to deal with preconceptions and misconceptions currently observed around our papers, and that’s why I am here. Ask me anything related to directed panspermia in general and our results in particular.Assuming that most redditors have no access to journal articles, we provide links to free arXiv versions, which are identical to official journal versions in content (they differ only in formatting).

"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">Science AMA Series: I’m Manolis Kellis, a professor of computer science at MIT studying the human genome to learn about what causes obesity, Alzheimer’s, cancer and other conditions. AMA about comp-bio and epigenomics, and how they impact human health!</h1>",manoli_mit,"Hello Reddit!Hello Reddit! My name’s Manolis Kellis, and I’m a professor at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), where I lead the Computational Biology group, and am also a member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.I study the human genome and its supremely underrated cousin, the human epigenome.Basically, your genome is the DNA you’re born with (“the book of life”). Your genes are the same in all your cells, but they play very different functions thanks to your epigenome, which highlights the parts of the genome that are important in each of your cell types.Last year, a decade after the human genome was sequenced, I was part of the team that helped create the most comprehensive map of the epigenome, as part of the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE consortium.By studying these maps, our team has helped figure out the control switches that turn your genes on and off in different cell types. The locations and activity of those switches have helped us gain insights about many diseases, including Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.Our results are sometimes challenging the way we see common disorders. For example, we found that genetic variants contributing to Alzheimer’s act through immune processes, rather than neuronal processes. For obesity, we found that the strongest genetic association acts via a master switch controlling energy storage vs. energy dissipation in our fat cells, rather than through the control of appetite in the brain.We hope that these insights will pave the way for new therapeutics. For example, we showed that we can manipulate the obesity switch we uncovered in human cells and in mice, to switch human fat-storing cells into fat-burning cells, and to boost the metabolism of mice, causing them to lose 50% of their fat mass with no change in exercise or appetite.In addition to disease genomics, my group works on comparative genomics, microRNAs, biological networks, flies, non-coding RNAs, and genome evolution. You can explore our papers from these and other areas in our interactive research page, and check out some related news stories, or watch video lectures describing our work, including my TEDx talk on the genomic revolution.I also teach two courses on computational biology that you may find interesting. Computational Biology: Genomes, Networks, Evolution provides a broad introduction to the field. Computational Personal Genomics surveys recent papers in human genetics and genomics. You can find both of these courses online, and I encourage you to explore many related classes through MIT’s Open CourseWare.A bit about me: I was born and raised in Greece, moved to France and then New York as a teenager, and got my Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Ph.D. degrees from MIT. I did my Ph.D. thesis with Eric Lander and Bonnie Berger at MIT on computational genomics. As an undergraduate, I worked on artificial intelligence, robotics, and computational geometry.Feel free to ask me about anything, including:what MIT, CSAIL, and the Broad Institute are likethe best islands to visit on your next trip to Greecewhy genetics is so important to the pharmaceutical industrywhy I got into computer science and/or genomicshow human evolution is shaping common and rare variants in human diseasewhat I do when I’m not studying the human genomeThanks for the great conversation and awesome questions!  Off to submit a grant but i'll try to be back tonight to try to answer a few more. Thank you all!DISCLAIMER: I am not an official spokesperson for CSAIL, MIT, the Broad, or anybody else but me.",7 years ago,4.3k,416 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4pmivr/science_ama_series_im_manolis_kellis_a_professor/
"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">[Megathread] President Trump’s Address on Border Security and the Democratic Response (Part 2)</h1>",PoliticsModeratorBot,"Please follow the comment guidelines - remain civil toward other users. Note that low effort or off topic discussion may be automatically removed in this threadTonight, President Trump will delivered prime-time Oval Office address to the nation, to discuss immigration and the ongoing government shutdown. The address aired on all major and cable networks. Directly following President Trump’s remarks was a response from Democratic leadership, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi. This also aired on the same major networks. Today marks the 18th day of a partial government shutdown, which has resulted in the closure of approximately 25% of federal agencies and left over 800,000 federal employees either out of work, or required to work without pay. President Trump has firmly stated that he will not agree to any spending bill that does not include the $5.7 billion in funding for his proposed Mexican border wall. In a statement released earlier today, the White House stated that Congress Must Do More to Address The Border Crisis.A great recap of the shutdown, courtesy of Gabe Fleisher of Wake Up To Politics, can be found hereAdditional links will be added later in the evening.

His comment has prompted me to post this update.I have added the edits into the following sections and clearly identified them to save anyone the ordeal of having to read the whole thing over again.The uptick rule – I think I misunderstood u/HeyItsPixeL on this one and caused a lot of unnecessary confusion.How an ETF works relating to its underlying holdings.The AI prediction.How I think the shorts are using the ETFs.The MOASA – important update here!The earnings report.My thoughts about the shorts passing the buck to others.Please skip to those bits if that is all that you are interested in. Before I get to them myself there are some points I would like to make in response the comments I’ve had.I have read every single comment replying to the post itself, and every direct response to a comment I have made, as well as anything that was at that time attached to the thread.If you replied to someone else’s comment then there is a good chance that I may have missed it so please respond to me directly if you want me to see it and I will read it, I promise.To all those calling me a shill, thank you. You are providing an invaluable service encouraging everyone to be distrustful and to do their own DD. It would be nice to have a bit more substance to the comment than simply calling me a shill, or pointing out that my account is only a month old, but every voice adds value to the conversation.To those who think I am advocating day trading, I am not. I am not advocating anything. I am personally diamond handing this bitch, but that’s just me. You don’t need me to show you that the market is rising and falling, anyone can see that for themselves. I can no more predict a rise or fall than I can shit out of my mouth.To those who asked for a TL:DR, well that’s what the title was. I can’t really do a middle point between the title and full text, sorry. I have no issue if anyone wants to do an abridged version and post it for themselves.To those who thanked me, thank you. It’s very reassuring and humbling that someone found my work worthwhile.To those who have challenged my understanding, thank you. Some of you have changed my perspective on certain things or I may have changed your perspective after some discussion. We haven’t always come to the same agreement but that’s fine – only you can decide what is right for you.To those who reached out and asked questions, thank you. I hope I have tried to answer them so that you can continue to make up your own mind.The only exception I made was for those asking me for advice on how I think certain things will happen. Please, I am no expert. I read the post by u/HeyItsPixeL and felt that his logic was flawed and people might mistakenly put their faith in his prediction. The reason I wrote my own post is to try to curb any loss of faith if March 19th isn’t lift off.I am not bearish on GME. I am long GME and have significant amounts of money on the table alongside yours. We are all playing for the same pot, and we all get to share in it if we win.Asking me for my opinion on things I have no particular knowledge of is like asking the electrician, who came to fix your house because the power cut out every time you drew a bath, how to solve the energy crisis.I’m flattered that you think my opinion is worth anything, and a few days ago I may have given it because I was nobody and it could be easily dismissed. Now I think I need to be more cautious because what I say can disproportionately influence others, and I don’t want to be responsible for anyone else’s financial decisions without being able to talk through the whole thing, good and bad.Finally, it was never my intention to undermine u/HeyItsPixeL or anyone else. I think he has done some really good analysis and his voice is one worth listening to. He clearly puts a lot of effort into creating his posts and gives us the benefit of his thoughts for fee. As with any DD posted around here, it is up to each of us to decide how much value we give to those thoughts and to decide if we come to the same conclusions.I am not trying to prove that I’m the most intelligent guy in the room. The only time I would accept that I am the most intelligent guy in any room is when I’m in the room alone, and at that time I am also the most retarded. Please, don’t lose sight of that simple truth when you ask for my advice or predictions.I think that’s more than enough of my pontificating. You came back for facts and updates, not to listen to me give an awards speech.Original Post (with new edits) below# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #I believe that the DD leading to March 19th is fatally flawed, and will explain with references to my sources.The DD I refer to was posted by u/HeyItsPixeL at:https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltua0n/endgame_dd_how_last_weeks_actions_all_come/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=sharePlease let me be clear, this post is not meant to shout anyone down but rather to develop the conversation. With over 6,100 comments on the main post I felt this warranted a post on its own so that it could be heard.Before I get into the important stuff, I would like to start with the really important stuff:To u/HeyItsPixeL and all the mods of this sub, as well as anyone posting DD, I believe we owe you our gratitude for putting in the effort to develop our understanding. Right or wrong, you are doing your best for the cause.If you are more interested in what I have to say than why I am saying it then please scroll down to the “Important Stuff”.For my 2 cents, I think it was right to publish the DD.There are many people whose DD is being deleted from other subs.r/GME is the only place where it appears that DD isn’t being deleted, and even stuff that appears to be totally bogus is being allowed to remain so that it can be discussed and called out. I applaud the mods for the courage to allow this level of free speech.In this entire sub the only suggestion of censoring of DD that I have seen is in response to the anticipation of the DD predicting the date of the squeeze. I think this was due to the over-hyped nature of the post (I’ve never before seen a trailer for a DD post!) and an instinctive knee-jerk reaction.I have not seen a single comment on any DD post saying that the DD shouldn’t have been posted because it helps the other side know what we know.Yes, it gives them a chance to readjust their tactics, but they can do that whether we know what they are up to or not, so I don’t think that is a major concern.Knowledge is power. And if we demonstrate the extent of our knowledge then we are showing our power.I personally can’t post on r/GME because I don’t have the minimum requirements. This is the only form of censorship that I can see taking place (not of me personally, but of new accounts) on this sub and I fully understand the reasons so that we can protect the sub from bots and shills using new accounts.Whether you have posted in favour or against a prediction of the date of the squeeze I think you are providing an invaluable contribution because it keeps this sub from being an echo chamber of positive sentiment. Just as in academia all research is peer-reviewed I think it only right that DD should be too. A critical friend is sometimes the best friend to have because they can help you see the error of your ways.Please consider me a critical friend.NOW THE IMPORTANT STUFF.This is worded as a response to the original post and put together from my comments and so is worded as though directed to u/HeyItsPixeL.The analysis isn’t tightly connected the conclusions. Most of the analysis is an assumption as to what transpired and barely features in the “Endgame”.I think your theory is very similar to the interstellar yo-yo theory, only that theory explains how the shorts get out of their position at crunch time on a cyclical basis whereas yours assumes they have got themselves stuck.https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le6v6v/the_interstellar_yoyo/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareYour post also reads as though both sides are engaging in massive amounts of market manipulation.They may be, but to suggest that the people long on GME are involved in market manipulation is just an invitation for the SEC to step in and put an end to the MOASS before it even happens. Cramer is apparently already talking about how we should all be paid $200 per share and be done with it (can’t remember the link and it’s not important enough to find). Let’s not give fuel to that argument!I believe there are the following factual errors and omissions in the analysis:I believe that most, if not all, people on this sub and others holding GME are doing so because they believe the stock can only go up in price. We are not buying in droves to manipulate the price upwards, we just buy what we can when we think the price looks good.1 The Rabbit Hole Part I.You have misunderstood the application of SHO Rule 201. It is not a drop of 10% in the trading day that triggers the uptick rule. It is a drop of 10% from the previous day’s close that triggers it.See: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.201 [(b)(1)(i)]This is just a factual error but doesn’t affect your conclusions. It does become important later though.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #EDIT – My bad!There is nothing in the original post that says he got the application of the rule wrong and having re-read it I now accept that I misunderstood. I was thrown by the graphic where he has underlined the opening price and the day high and mistakenly thought that he believed the uptick rule applied based on the opening price.To be fair, he does not say or even imply this in his text and I have jumped to this conclusion on my own.As I said originally, it does not make any difference to the outcome of his analysis.So why even mention it in my original post?I was concerned that people would misunderstand the application of the rule and assume shenanigans where there are none, for example thinking that the uptick rule should have applied on the 25th of February where the stock opened at $169.56 and fell to a low of $101 during the trading day.I apologise profusely for breeding completely unnecessary confusion.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #2 The Rabbit Hole Part II.I think the suggestion that these events were an orchestrated plan by a secret HF trying to force a future MOASS is dangerous. There is no analysis of past options trading to suggest that the chain of options was anything out of the ordinary.The way that things played out on the 24th was a gamma squeeze similar to what took place in January, only with less of a chain reaction as the stock price was held below $100 by the close of trading. In the next 2 days the shorts managed to contain the fire by finishing below $110.I think you are right that $50 was the critical price to trigger the squeeze that day, but $40 was also important on the 19th of February. The gamma squeeze occurred purely because of uncovered calls by the shorts. Let’s not give them ammunition to say that it was actually caused by manipulation by people going long.In the absence of any analysis of previous trading patterns then your suggestions are purely hypothetical. They may be right, but I think it only right that you highlight the distinction between evidence supported DD and anecdotally supported hypotheses.3 The Rabbit Hole Part III.Your reference for the 21 days to cover a naked short is outdated (probably written around 2007 as this is the latest date in the text and it does not include the updates to regulation SHO introduced in 2008 and 2009. It does not even contain a mention of the uptick rule [reg 201] introduced in 2010.)For the current limits, which are only 13 trading days for FTD, please see:https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.203 [(b)(3)]Rule 203(b)(3) is the one that requires them to settle a FTD.The important thing about rule 203(b)(3) is that it only applies to Threshold Securities, so if GME isn’t on the list then the requirement to buy back in 13 days later doesn’t apply. GME hasn’t been on the Threshold List since the 3rd of February and still isn’t back on it now!3 The Rabbit Hole Part III, (Part 2)I think you missed something very important in your analysis. Remember good old reg. 201, the uptick rule? You’ve overlooked this on the 26th Feb.That day the price tanked from a previous close of $108 to a low of $86. That means from around midday the uptick rule was in play and shorting on a downturn was not permitted. And yet for the last 90 minutes of the market open they managed to aggressively push the price down from $117 to a $101 close.How could this happen if they couldn’t short on a downturn, and an analysis of the candles at 1 minute intervals shows that there were repeated large volume sales with no uptick in that time?Either the shorts lied about the fact they were selling short – dangerous but not impossible.Or these weren’t short sales but actual shares being sold.But by who?Opportunists who think that $120 was the high at which to sell? Unlikely after the stock opened at $169 the previous day and had hit an earlier high that same day of $142. Unlikely but not impossible.Who else owned a shit ton of shares and had a motive to sell (if that would mean bringing the price down)? Possibly those who got caught in the gamma squeeze earlier in the week, who had bought to hedge against the ever increasing number of calls likely to finish ITM. Remember, volumes were crazy high AH on Wednesday and on Thursday. They bought a shit ton of shares to cover their possible losses on calls and forced a gamma squeeze.The close at $108 meant that many calls below that amount were likely exercised already as they’d closed above strike.The price had run back down to just shy of $120, meaning the calls at $110 and $120 were in danger of finishing ITM at the close of the day.They could buy in to hedge against the need to buy to cover, but this would risk another gamma squeeze to end the week.Or they could sell the ones they bought to hedge their positions, forcing the price lower so that they wouldn’t suffer any more losses and hopefully avoiding another gamma squeeze.Remember that the uptick rule would be in place on Monday and they would have little leverage to manipulate the price back down as they did on Thursday. Finishing with a gamma squeeze on Friday with a restriction on shorting on Monday could have ignited the rockets and started the MOASS.3 The Rabbit Hole Part IV.Important - XRT holdings of GME did not increase.The value of the holdings of GME increased, but that was the case for everyone holding GME. We went from holding shares worth $40 at the end of the week to holding shares worth $101 at the end of the week. Unless we bought or sold in the meantime then we still have the same number of shares.Exactly the same is true of XRT and the other ETFs, except that unlike us they can’t increase or decrease their holdings of GME. They have to hold the same number of shares relative to their total float.Don’t get blinded by the value of GME as a percentage of the ETFs, that way madness lies.(More on this below.)# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #Edit – Additional InformationPeople have asked how an ETF works relative to the underlying.I posted a comment here explaining why the value of GME in the ETF changed:https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lup27l/march_19_is_not_likely_to_be_lift_off/gpdhlli?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3It was originally written a few weeks ago in response to work being done by u/ahh_soy and so is a little outdated in terms of the values quoted as things have changed since then, but the essence remains correct.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #Evidence to support March 19th 2021:1. AI Prediction starts around that Date:First off, you can’t say something will happen “on” a given date because something else says it will happen “around” that date.Second, this is a computer model. If it were that reliable then the person who built it would be a multi billionaire because they would have the only known working crystal ball in the world!Please, let’s not overstate the accuracy of this model. Remember, garbage in = garbage out.And if the cogs in the machine aren’t aligned right then even with pure raw materials going in you’re just going to get a gnarled mess at the other end.I personally have not seen the apocryphal model and so I don’t want to be disparaging towards it other than to sound a note of caution.You don’t give any links to the model for anyone to check for themselves, just to the raw data, which is useless on its own.Has the model proven its ability to predict the future?For example, if you put in the data until the end of December does it predict the gamma squeeze that happened at the end of January?Did it predict this week’s gamma squeeze based on the data up to the end of January?When was the model last updated?To me, the model is not evidence of anything, just confirmation bias.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #Edit – Additional InformationA big thank you to u/ReceptionNo3764 who started the conversation with this comment:https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lup27l/march_19_is_not_likely_to_be_lift_off/gp8wm6u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3He kindly gave me links to the AI model and an explanation by another person who has commented on the confidence interval.In short, the model predicts that there is a greater than 50 % chance that GME WILL NOT even reach the heady heights of the January spike ever again.The model takes no account of the short interest, the amount of naked shares of GME out there, and the activities being hidden in the ETFs. It simply predicts what the price will be based on absolutely normal trading conditions and price data from 2020.Believe what you will, but believe in this model at your own peril!# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #2. Remember the naked short activity on February 24th and 25th?You are measuring daily short volume and assuming that equates to short interest. Read the disclaimer that comes with the data that you are quoting – these are not necessarily short sales (though I expect many are.) Don’t pin your hopes on daily short volume being an indicator of eventual short interest.I’ve already debunked the 21 days for the FTDs.3. March 19th is XRT rebalance day.I think you are flawed in your assessment that XRT will pay a dividend by the 19th of March.Look at the table you posted – look at all of it. Ex-dividend Dates are published months in advance. They haven’t been published for this year yet.Why do you think that a process that would normally allow for about a month between the Declaration Date and the Ex-Dividend dates for most stocks, and in the case of XRT specifically has always been 2 months in advance for the March Dividend (longer for the rest as the dates are published annually,) be rushed through in less than 3 weeks this time around?The Ex-dividend Dates in 2020 were all on a Monday, not a Friday. Then again, the dates for 2019 were all Fridays. History doesn’t allow us to predict when it will be with any degree of certainty. IMHO, you have a 20% chance of being right.You have no source for your claim about the Ex-dividend Date and so this is pure speculation at this point.Also, the importance of the Ex-dividend Date is overstated.Yes, short sellers pay in lieu the price of the dividend. Yes, there is a tax liability for dividends paid in lieu by short sellers. But the short seller is in no way responsible for the tax liability – it is all on the shareholder.In fact, if the short seller has held the short position unhedged for 45 days then they actually get a tax break for paying the dividend in lieu:https://www.fool.com/taxes/2015/01/15/dividends-paid-on-short-sales.aspxYou make the mistake of referring to another Reddit DD post without verifying what they are saying is true. This is why Wikipedia isn’t a trusted source of information - because anyone can write whatever they want.Also, the most recent dividend was 25c.How likely are the shorts to worry about 25c on an $80 share that they have shorted when they stand to collapse if GME takes off? They are losing more than that by the price spikes in GME pushing the price of the underlying up disproportionately (and don’t forget, you say that they covered all of the rest of the underlying straight away so they aren’t even profiting from those other shares in the underlying falling in value!)I think some things need to be kept in perspective, and the relative importance of the dividend payments IMHO isn’t a big factor here.You talk about the ETF rebalancing but don’t explain it or how it will affect the game.What is rebalancing? It is the process by which the ETF adjusts the amount of shares of each underlying it holds relative to each other so that they have the correct weighted value.What does this mean?Well, as you pointed put GME is about 10% of the value of the underlying of XRT. That means movement in the price of GME has far more of an effect on the share price of XRT than the other underlying stocks. This is bad for the ETF because they want to be the stable ship in rough waters.The shorts are shorting ETFs because this depresses the stock price of the ETF and makes the AP redeem shares for the underlying to keep the share price in balance with NAV. They are pumping in money to depress the share price of XRT so that GME will be pushed out the other end, which will in turn depress the value of GME because it is listed for sale in large volumes.What happens at rebalancing?Well, if GME is 10% of the value of the underlying and the ETF wants it to be only 1%, they are going to reduce their holdings of GME by somewhere in the region of 90%.This is bad because it means that at that point the shorts won’t have to pump the money in to short the ETF to get GME onto the market, the ETF will just give it up.More GME will be released onto the market than was pumped out on the 28th and 29th of January without the shorts having to spend a single penny shorting that day.March 19th could actually turn out to be the day of the Mother Of All Short Attacks (MOASA!). Except it won’t be a short attack but a reaction to the gamma squeeze.When is this going to happen? Yep, March 19th.Am I guessing? Fuck no. I do my research:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1064642/000119312517327645/d458838d497k.htm“Rebalancing occurs on the third Friday of the quarter ending month.” Or March 19th if the quarter ends in March.Okay, so technically I am guessing that the quarter ends in March for XRT, but at least I’m giving the information for those more capable than me to find the missing piece to finish this part of the puzzle.Could there be a silver lining to rebalancing?I think so.If the number of GME shares held by the ETFs is reduced by 90% relative to the number of shares of the ETF itself then this means that the same amount of shorting of the ETFs after the rebalancing will have 10% of its current effect.The shorts won’t be able to manipulate the price of GME via the ETFs so easily from March 19th onwards.Rebalancing places no onus on a short seller to do anything. It is a purely internal process for the ETF. Based on $100 per share of GME, it will be about 10 times harder to manipulate GME through XRT.As an aside, this document which details how the ETF will be run and managed makes no reference to when dividends will be paid. IMHO past patterns are not necessarily indicative of future behaviours, particularly in the age of COVID.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #Edit – Additional InformationThis is the one that generated the most discussion and so I had to resort to pretty much copy and paste responses. Most people are under the belief that in order to cover their shorts in an ETF they have to first purchase GME. I don’t believe this to be true.Please check out my comments beginning at:https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lup27l/march_19_is_not_likely_to_be_lift_off/gpb0kup?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3The MOASA controversyA LOT of people thought I was bearish because I could see a bad day in our future.Let me be clear, a lot of us are in the dark here. I’m heading along the same road as you, and if I see a great big hole in the road I’m going to let you guys know about it so that if we can’t go around it we at least expect the bumpy ride!Maybe it was unwise to call it the MOASA because of the obvious similarity to the MOASS. The intelligent predictions are that the MOASS will last days, if not weeks.The MOASA will be a one time event, over in a day.To my mind a “Short Attack” is an artificial manifestation of negative sentiment.What do I mean by this?A short sale gives the impression that people holding GME long are deciding to liquidate their positions. A short attack gives the impression that investors are doing this en masse, causing the stock price to tumble.The effect of having a shit ton of GME released onto the market in one go would have the same effect as a short attack because it is not true negative sentiment, just a by-product of balancing the books.The GME might not even make it to the market because I suspect that what the ETFs are holding at the moment is naked longs of GME and so when the GME is purged from the ETF holdings it will just be used by the AP to close their naked positions.The MOASA B-BombBig thanks to u/daj4058 who wrinkled my brain with this comment:https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lup27l/march_19_is_not_likely_to_be_lift_off/gp95n6w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3March 19th is rebalancing day and also quadruple witching day. GME might not be so needed in the ETFs that currently hold it, but if GME goes on to the Russell 1000 index then there could be a great many more ETFs that will pick it up as part of their underlying assets.The good news if this happens – no MOASA.The not so good news – new ETFs for the shorts to hide in.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #4. Massive Chain OptionsWhat you have here is an observation, not an analysis. So GME has ridiculous chain options that day in particular compared to dates before and after.But so do all other stocks.So why is GME the important one out of all the shares on the market?The data you’ve quoted is comparing apples and oranges, only the Calls in GME and only the Puts in the others. What about the Puts in GME and the Calls in the others?If you compare GME volume of calls with the volume of Calls in other stocks is there any discernible difference? Likewise with the Puts?The post you refer to is written by someone I can’t make my mind up on. I think he is either extremely talented, the mutha of all FUDders, or he is a simple smooth brain with amazing mining skills.He started the whole $40 close argument on the 12th of February. Almost all of this sub came out shouting him down because he made such fundamental mistakes in that post.And if you look at his post commenting on the 25th of February activity:https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lss0pw/gme_thursday_225_update_the_battle_begins_we_ride/He says:“If they shorted 33,000,000 shares, and let's be very generous and say they shorted every share at $100, that would be $3,300,000,000 (billion with a B) in stock shorted today. They shorted GameStop's entire market cap worth of shares in one day“Again, let's be generous and say that it cost them 6% on average for them. The day started at 1.1% and ended at 12.8%... so we'll give them the middle (finger).“$3,300,000,000 x 6% = $198,000,000 in borrow costs today alone. $200mil just to drive the price down for a single day. It's that important.”Makes for great reading, except the percentages that he’s talking about are interest rates (APR) and he talks about them as if they are a fixed fee. Don’t believe me, then follow his Fintel link to see for yourself.This guy is able to mine and interpret huge amounts of complicated options data and then interpret them in order to be able to draw conclusions that nobody else can see and yet doesn’t know how a credit card works? Do you really expect me he can’t tell the difference between an interest rate and a borrowing fee? Really?I think if you are going to trust someone else’s DD then you really need to be sure of the person.5. Quadrulpe Witching DayCombine these observations about options chains with your fifth point about March 19th being a Quadruple Witching Day and you might actually have your answer. The market is expecting a lot of volatility on this one day and so is it any wonder that everyone is hedging against that volatility?You’re drawing a conclusion based on a single observation that has another obvious explanation.What historically happens on quadruple witching days? They happen 4 times a year, most recently in December 2020, so there should be plenty of data out there to look at and establish if March 19th 2021 is any different or just repeating the same pattern that occurs every 3 months of every year.6. Gamestop Q4 Earnings are released 4 Business Days after March 19thHow on earth is that going to affect the short sellers?Do you expect a massive swell of confidence before the earnings report is announced as opposed to after it?You’d might as well include the fact that Ryan Cohen has the staff of GameStop looking for the cure for cancer and expects them to find it on March 23rd.Okay, I’m being obtuse, but I hope you get my point that the earnings report will affect things after it’s published, not before.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #Edit – Additional InformationMany people have commented that prices often swell in the run up to earnings reports and dip afterwards – buying the rumour and selling the news.Okay, I’ll accept that if others say it is a common occurrence. I would hedge that comment by saying that GME is not in any way a usual stock these days.I would also say that if the anticipation of the earnings report is enough to build the upward momentum, then by the same logic the dip that comes from the actual earnings report may be the brakes that stop the squeeze.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #7. Now that the price is rising, EVERY FRIDAY, millions worth of stock on contract is going in the money.Sorry, no.Only if the price continues rising will millions worth of stock finish ITM.They’ve probably already dealt with the majority of the Calls up to $100 (who wouldn’t have exercised their contracts this week when the price went over?) so only those over $100 pose a danger now. If they can keep the stock under $110 then these contracts aren’t a danger any more.The only person diamond balled enough not to have exercised a Call contract that I know of is DFV himself, who is sitting on $12 Calls expiring on the 16th of April. Who knows, maybe he’s waiting for the perfect time to pull the trigger on them to send his 100,000 shares held long into orbit. If he’s still holding then it’s probably it’s because he thinks the stock still has a ways to go up.My Thoughts?With the rebalancing taking place on the quadruple witching day it's likely to be a very volatile day with huge amounts of GME dumped on the market so don't be at all surprised if we close that day down on the previous day.The really important part of the picture that is missing for me is who sold the calls that are now finishing ITM?The shorts have known for months that the MOASS is coming and they are caught in the middle of it. They need a way out, and desperately. Are we really to believe that their entire plan is to continue shorting until GameStop goes bankrupt? Well that’s not likely to happen so I doubt that is their plan.The other escape route? Get GME back down to a value where they cover their shorts and buy back gradually. Still unlikely with the estimated number of shares floating around and the diamond hands that hold those shares.I’m just spit balling, but what if the shorts are the ones who bought all the calls, and then forced the gamma squeeze this week? They make money from the calls being exercised and have a shit ton more stock to sell on the market to depress the share price.Shorting an ETF means that the price of GME gets artificially depressed. The AP has to acquire new shares of GME to bring the AUM back up in line with the share price of the ETF compared to NAV. The shorts have now passed the bag for their positions in GME to the AP who had to create naked longs to reconstitute the ETF holdings.By hiding in the calls they could be passing the buck for their naked short positions to others. Citadel buys calls from another clearing house, who gets caught in a gamma squeeze and now has to find shares at any price. Now the other clearing house has a vested interest in seeing the price of GME collapse. Share your pain with your enemies and all of a sudden they have the same interests as you and you have an enemy in common. A far more pressing danger that needs to be dealt with so that you both get out alive, because if they go down then you have no choice but to go down with them.I know that the general rule is that as soon as you mention the Nazis you lose the argument.But the whole world united against the Nazi party and their axis pals.What happened immediately after they were vanquished? The allied forces went back to their old factions and we had 40 years of cold war.If the shorts manage to get every other MM on the hook if GME spikes then you bet your assess they will group together to cover themselves, regardless of how much they despise each other.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #Edit – Additional InformationQuite a few people sent me the link to Uncle Bruce’s recent youtube video where he discusses a very similar situation:https://youtu.be/VwXLRoAw3Z4Now this guy seems like he really knows his shit and can explain it in a way that really engages.I think there is broad agreement that the gamma squeeze is coming first, followed by the MOASS.What I did was in my original post was see a shadow and I imagined a monster lurking there.Uncle Bruce sees the monster in all its gruesome glory.I actually feel better having seen the video though. The more I understand a situation, the less there is to fear.If the shorts see this opportunity for making money and closing their positions, imagine the opportunities that the HFs going long will see. If they bought 2 million shares in the way Uncle Bruce describes in the video, not only would they squeeze Chicago, they’ll also squeeze the shorts.If the shorts are able to see this opportunity then I’ve no doubt the HF going long will be able to see it.And if Chicago becomes a bag holder along with the shorts then that doesn’t really help the shorts much, because all Chicago have done is add to the problem by selling all those naked Call options.Moving on from Uncle Bruce, one very helpful person pointed out that it is very ethno-centric of me to say that “the rest of the world” united against the axis powers. This is a very valid point – only the allied forces united against the axis powers. The allied forces were not by any stretch the “rest of the world” and I humbly beg the forgiveness of the rest of the world for overlooking you.Someone else pointed out that in my analogy retail is the equivalent of the Nazis. This is an unfortunate and unintended consequence of my analogy. To be clear, I think retail are the only good guys in this game, and deep down even we are just in it for the tendies.Fuck Nazis.# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #Here endeth my ramblings.Please accept these comments in the spirit they are intended.I am sitting on the same rocket as you, waiting for lift off.My wife and kids are next to me and our savings are right under the burners and stand to get eviscerated if this thing starts up but doesn’t take off.I have friends and family sat all around me holding onto my diamond hands while wearing blindfolds, trusting in my research and DD.We are all in this together and I want you to be right as much as you do. But wanting ain’t worth jack.We are comrades in this war of attrition and I assume that if you are holding GME not only do you have diamond hands and balls of steel, but also skin thick enough to have someone disagree with your opinion without taking it as a personal affront.I would like nothing more than for someone to prove me wrong because I don’t have any answers, just observations.And even if I am not proved wrong, that doesn’t mean that the MOASS isn’t still brewing on the horizon with more and more fuel being pumped into the tanks ready for lift off.Peace.",2 years ago,4.2k,820 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lup27l/march_19_is_not_likely_to_be_lift_off/
"<h1 class=""_eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"">10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM</h1>",pmchem,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/ .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdfDSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to etfrc.com. So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s ).  Methodology here: https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, https://freedometfs.com/frdm/ . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.ok, here's a bonus #11:11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?edit, 6 hours after OP: wow, this post blew up!  I'm so happy many people are finding this discussion informative.

And should be read in full by anyone willing and wanting to learn how these things work. You will find a great recent example of this to be r/antiwork, who were manipulated and broken into tiny pieces to keep the workers of America under corporate boots.Oh, hey there apes. It's sure been awhile eh? Your heightened defenses even managed to keep ME out. You really did take the information I gave you to heart, eh? That fills me with warmth.But, as I've come to notice recently, people keep asking me to repost this for the sake of keeping the new people abreast on what needs to be done to protect the holders of GME. Beneath here will be a detailed account on what you need to be aware of in your online interactions, to avoid being taken for a fool!_______________________________________________________________________COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forumTwenty-Five Rules of DisinformationEight Traits of the DisinformationalistHow to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent)Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression_______________________________________________________________________COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum..There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.'Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING'If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositioned postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.Technique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING'A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at www.abovetopsecret.com) is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favor is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favor is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.'Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION'Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favorite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favorite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.Technique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING'Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution.Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.CONCLUSIONRemember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ._______________________________________________________________________Twenty-Five Rules of DisinformationNote: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up.1. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know, don't discuss it -- especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If it's not reported, it didn't happen, and you never have to deal with the issues.2. Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the 'How dare you!' gambit.3. Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such 'arguable rumors'. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a 'wild rumor' from a 'bunch of kids on the Internet' which can have no basis in fact.4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.6. Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism, reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponent's viewpoint.7. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive.8. Invoke authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough 'jargon' and 'minutia' to illustrate you are 'one who knows', and simply say it isn't so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources.9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.10. Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man -- usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with - a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues -- so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source.11. Establish and rely upon fall-back positions. Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the 'high road' and 'confess' with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made -- but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, 'just isn't so.' Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later, and even publicly 'call for an end to the nonsense' because you have already 'done the right thing.' Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for 'coming clean' and 'owning up' to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues.12. Enigmas have no solution. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues.13. Alice in Wonderland Logic. Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact.14. Demand complete solutions. Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10.15. Fit the facts to alternate conclusions. This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place.16. Vanish evidence and witnesses. If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you won't have to address the issue.17. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can 'argue' with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues.18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.'19. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the 'play dumb' rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance.20. False evidence. Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations -- as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications.21. Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body. Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim.22. Manufacture a new truth. Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively.23. Create bigger distractions. If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to distract the multitudes.24. Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by destroying them financially, emotionally, or severely damaging their health.25. Vanish. If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen._______________________________________________________________________Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist1) Avoidance. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility.2) Selectivity. They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well.3) Coincidental. They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason.4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength.5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for 'conspiracy theorists' and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain. Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do.6) Artificial Emotions. An odd kind of 'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial.Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the 'image' and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style. It's just a job, and they often seem unable to 'act their role in character' as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later -- an emotional yo-yo.With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up.7) Inconsistent. There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat 'freudian', so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within.I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. I'm not aware of too many Navy pilots who don't have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it.8) Time Constant. Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation:a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth.b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to 'get permission' or instruction from a formal chain of command.c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay - the team approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin._______________________________________________________________________How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent)One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why?1) The message doesn't get out.2) A lot of time is wasted3) The activist is frustrated and discouraged4) Nothing good is accomplished.FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established.Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country.Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female.The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs.This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists.It is the agent's job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control.In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist:""You're dividing the movement.""[Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people]This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of ""dedication to the cause."" Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that ""on purpose."" It's amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: ""they did that unconsciously... they didn't really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting "" and so on and so forth.The agent will tell the activist:""You're a leader!""This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist.This is ""malignant pseudo identification."" It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activist's identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist.Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudo identification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge.The goal of the agent is to increase the activist's general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activist's self-concepts.The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of ""twinship"". It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler.The activist's ""felt quality of perfection"" [self-concept] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victim's own narcissistic investments. [self-concepts] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is ""mirroring"" them.The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that ""twinship alliances"" between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally ""lose touch with reality.""Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be ""helpers"" endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent.Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist's narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness.The agent's expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion.It can usually be identified by two events, however:First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being ""emotionally hooked,"" will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent.As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that ""the play has ended, the curtain has fallen,"" and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim.The fact is, the movement doesn't need leaders, it needs MOVERS. ""Follow the leader"" is a waste of time.A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions.Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner:1) To disrupt the agenda2) To side-track the discussion3) To interrupt repeatedly4) To feign ignorance5) To make an unfounded accusation against a person.Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members.SaboteursSome saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will ....1) Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites)2) Print flyers in English only.3) Have demonstrations in places where no one cares.4) Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support5) Display banners with too many words that are confusing.6) Confuse issues.7) Make the wrong demands.8) Compromise the goal.9) Have endless discussions that waste everyone's time. The agent may accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to slow down the activist's work.Provocateurs1) Want to establish ""leaders"" to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement.2) Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble.3) Encourage militancy.4) Want to taunt the authorities.5) Attempt to make the activist compromise their values.6) Attempt to instigate violence. Activism ought to always be non-violent.7) Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence.Informants1) Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything.2) Ask a lot of questions (gathering data).3) Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend.4) Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of commitment.RecruitingLegitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves.Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents.SurveillanceALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance.At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist!Scare TacticsThey use them.Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set up ""exposure,"" they will send incriminating letters [emails] in the name of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow.This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists.If an agent is ""exposed,"" he or she will be transferred or replaced.COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of information act.The FBI counterintelligence program's stated purpose: To expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests. ""National Security"" means the FBI's security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation of people's civil liberties._______________________________________________________________________Seventeen Techniques for Truth SuppressionStrong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party.1. Dummy up. If it's not reported, if it's not news, it didn't happen.2. Wax indignant. This is also known as the ""How dare you?"" gambit.3. Characterize the charges as ""rumors"" or, better yet, ""wild rumors."" If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through ""rumors."" (If they tend to believe the ""rumors"" it must be because they are simply ""paranoid"" or ""hysterical."")4. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike.5. Call the skeptics names like ""conspiracy theorist,"" ""nutcase,"" ""ranter,"" ""kook,"" ""crackpot,"" and, of course, ""rumor monger."" Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the ""more reasonable"" government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own ""skeptics"" to shoot down.6. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not).7. Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful.8. Dismiss the charges as ""old news.""9. Come half-clean. This is also known as ""confession and avoidance"" or ""taking the limited hangout route."" This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal ""mistakes."" This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets.10. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable.11. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster ""suicide"" note was forged, they would have reported it. They haven't reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak.12. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why?13. Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions.14. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as ""bump and run"" reporting.15. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the ""facts"" furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source.16. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges ""expose"" scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money.17. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, ""What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?"" Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not.",1 year ago,3.8k,214 comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sm27ag/a_refresher_on_the_state_of_fud_guess_who_is/

In that time, they've added cameras with artificial intelligence, demanded we wear all Amazon branded gear or we could be fired, jack my schedule around from 5 days to 3 on a whim, put us in the shadiest parts of town where I get chased by dogs and people try to rob me, my PTO accrues less now than it used to, etc.The way they treat us has gone downhill QUICK. Today, I get a message saying we have to turn our van off, take the key out, and lock the door at every stop. I have 200+ stops and it's getting hot as hell out here. That was the last straw.I told my boss that all the declining working conditions and the way they've been treating us has been hard to put up with, but this is something I just refuse to do.

He won't even give me two weeks. Fuck them.Edit 2: It's been 2.5 hours and I have an interview with FedEx next week. Thanks for the support, everyone.

It's one of the many examples of the game reminding players that they are tiny and can get through small paths, and I really appreciated when Stray's puzzles rewarded proper ""just walk right through"" thinking.Attack of the Fanboy - Shaun Cichacki - 3 / 5 It's hard to perfectly encapsulate what Stray really sets out to do, as it is a jack of all trades, but unfortunately a master of none of them. Certain parts of this game are near masterclass, like its stealth sections, but it finds itself lost within its own identity too often, and misses the mark on more than one occasion.AusGamers - Kosta Andreadis - 8 / 10Outside of a handful of action sequences, the pacing here is slow and measured. And without any real difficulty or challenge, there’s a meditative quality to Stray.BaziCenter - Omid Sedigh Imani - Persian - 9 / 10Stray is not without fault, but it’s certainly good enough to be worth every second of your time and every penny of your money.Boomstick Gaming - Boomstick Alex - BuyVideo Review - Quote not availableBut Why Tho? - Quinn Hiers - 9.5 / 10Stray astounds with its beautiful graphics, quirky characters, and puzzles that bring out the best and worst in a cat.CGMagazine - Zubi Khan - 8.5 / 10Stray is a game oozing with charm and can be considered a must-play for cat lovers looking for something new to pounce on and sink their teeth into.COGconnected - Jaz Sagoo - 86 / 100While the game lacks challenge, the pace and memorable set-pieces make this a tremendous trek with a tabby.Checkpoint Gaming - Elliot Attard - 9 / 10A lusciously dense world of natural beauty colliding with cyber-future grimness is ready to be explored from a uniquely tiny perspective. Stray tells a surprisingly emotional tale that instantly grips during its opening moments and doesn’t relent until its closing scene. A standout release so far this year, Stray proves to be so much deeper than just a cat adventure game.Console Creatures - Steve Vegvari - RecommendedStray is a delightful time made by a team who clearly cares about the relationship one has with their own animal.Destructoid - Jordan Devore - 9 / 10I’m so happy Stray exists and that BlueTwelve Studio stuck the landing.Dexerto - Brad Norton - 7 / 10If you go in purely to see the world in motion and walk through its immense cityscapes, you’ll be delighted by what’s on offer. But if you go in expecting a substantial gaming experience with plenty of input and deep engagement, you may end up disappointed.  Falling somewhere in the middle, I can appreciate Stray’s overachieving presentation but wonder what could have been with this setting and this attention to detail had it not centered around a cat with limited room for gameplay systems.Digital Trends - Giovanni Colantonio - 4 / 5 Stray delivers on its adorable cat adventure premise, but its excellent atmosphere and strong sci-fi storytelling are what elevate it.Digitally Downloaded - Trent - 4.5 / 5 Anyone expecting Stray to be an action-packed stealth game – as the promotional material tried to argue it is – might be disappointed as the game is more about the journey and the narrative than it is about skulking. What Stray does well is expressing a journey featuring a less-than-common protagonist, and while other games have covered similar themes it’s that unique perspective, from much closer to ground level, and the visual stimulating scenes that makes it ground well worth padding over again.EGM - Josh Harmon - 4 / 5 Stray does a great job at letting you act like a cat, turning a wide range of true-to-life feline behaviors into clever gameplay mechanics. But it's much less successful at making you truly feel like a cat, as the game's more conventional approach to its gameplay and story routinely shatters your immersion in odd ways. If you can suspend your disbelief and look past the missed opportunity of a more cohesive experience, however, there's a lot to like in its moody cyberpunk world and varied challenges.Easy Allies - Michael Damiani - 8.5 / 10Play as an adorable kitty and use their cat prowess to charm the people around them in order to make their way back home.Echo Boomer - David Fialho - Portuguese - UnscoredStray is not just the ""cat simulator"" it's a simple, adorable and emotional journey for all ages with a great atmosphere, themes and great moments.Enternity.gr - Hektor Apostolopoulos - Greek - 8 / 10Stray offers a cat, a dystopian environment, and overall a videogame that should not be missing from your collection.Eurogamer - Lottie Lynn - RecommendedStray captures the essence of being a cat, while delivering a deeper journey through a dying cybercity.Explosion Network - Dylan Blight - 9 / 10Stray is a vibe, starring a cat that'll go down in hiss-tory. I fell for the feline companion and the strange, wonderful world it tumbles into in a heartbeat.GGRecon - 8 / 10If you are a cat-lover then the game is an absolute must, you'll be instantly connected to the main character of Stray – who must be protected and cherished at all costs.Game Informer - Blake Hester - 8 / 10It's a solid, brief ride through a strange world and one well worth taking.Game Rant - Dalton Cooper - 4.5 / 5 'Cat game' Stray accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, delivering an authentic cat experience in the form of an adorable puzzle/platformer.Game Revolution - Paul Tamburro - 8 / 10BlueTwelve has provided a gorgeous and unique setting to match its unique protagonist, and although its action and puzzle-solving may be too simple for some tastes, it excels where it matters — and what matters is making you feel like a cat.GameByte - Joshua Boyles - 9.5 / 10Though short, Stray is a delight of a game to experience. Forcing players to make organic progress feels like a genuine achievement, and viewing this world through the unique perspective of a cat gives the story considerable more weight. Stray is a game that you will think about even when you’re not playing it. Like a good book, its world pulls you in and you never want to put it down. It’s nice to see at least one cyberpunk game live up to the hype, eh?GameGrin - Alana Dunitz - 10 / 10Everything in Stray works together so well; the characters, the story, and being a cat is so realistic and fun that it is so rewarding. I can't recommend this game enough; it is my game of the year for 2022 meow!GameSkinny - George Yang - 9 / 10 Stray isn't just a game about a cat trying to get home, but one about an even greater adventure. And doing cat things.GameSpew - Kim Snaith - 8 / 10As it is, Stray may be short, but it’s perfectly formed.GameSpot - Alessandro Barbosa - 9 / 10Stray expertly embodies the abilities of its feline protagonist to create a captivating puzzle adventure in an engrossing post-apocalyptic worldGameWatcher - Bogdan Robert Mateș - 5.5 / 10Stray is at its best when it lets you do the things you'd expect from a cat – sleeping on cozy pillows, meowing, or scratching sofas – but fails to build consistently compelling gameplay around these flavorful bits. Although it creates a believable world, I found it hard to connect with the robots you encounter across its forgotten city, making the game's admittedly grand climax feel hollow.Gameblog - Camille Allard - French - 8 / 10Stray is a very good surprise. It is not a simple game where you play as a cat but it's a poetic, touching and exciting adventure.Gamefa - Mostafa Zahedi - Persian - 6.8 / 10without a doubt, Stray is one of the most unique experiences of 2022. The thrill of an eventful adventure as a Cat is something you will remember for a long time. That being said, keep your expectations low because at the end of the day, stray is a small project. Its biggest flaw, is the wasted potential that could have turned into something special. Nevertheless, if you happen to be a cat lover, Playing Stray is a must!Gamepur - Aden Carter - 8.5 / 10Even though the story of Stray feels slightly incomplete, the overall experience is well worth the price you pay for it. The developers built a large, well-constructed city that gives you a great experience of what it's like to be a cat in a world built for creatures larger than you.Gamers Heroes - Johnny Hurricane - 80 / 100It’s simple: If you want to play as a cat, then Stray is the game for you. However, if you’re more of a dog person, then skip it.Gamersky - 心灵奇兵 - Chinese - 8.3 / 10Stray is a short and sweet game, with a unique and immersive adventure from a cat's point of view under a beautiful cyberpunk vision. The story of this lonely city and stray cats will still linger on.GamesHub - David Wildgoose - 4 / 5 Stray gets so much right about being a cat. It's not just the way you travel through the world. There are moments when you stop to rub your side against someone's legs. You can press a button to scratch the carpet and there are even a couple of puzzles that make smart use of this ability. The way you stretch out one paw to tentatively bat at a suspicious object or how you curl up on a cushion in the perfect pretzel… it's just so exquisitely, believably cat-like.GamesRadar+ - Sam Loveridge - 4.5 / 5 Stray is a phenomenal, if compact, feline adventure that captures cats perfectly - even if they do find themselves in a bizarrely beautiful robotic world.Gaming Nexus - Henry Yu - 10 / 10Stray is more than just a cat simulator; it's a love letter to cats and cat owners alike. It is an absolute spectacle from beginning to end, with a heart wrenching narrative and enough cat-centric puzzles to have you meowing for more. BlueTwelve Studio did an immaculate job bringing this project to life, immersing you in a dystopian world filled to the brim with mystery, all the while making you truly feel like an adorable feline. We need more games like this in the industry, ones that stand tall on their own and don't bank on the success of their inspirations.GamingBolt - Shubhankar Parijat - 8 / 10Stray has a unique premise, a rich world, an engaging story, fun gameplay, and it lets you play as a cat. It's a good game.GamingINTEL - Callum Self - 9 / 10Stray may offer a heartwarming narrative, alongside some great visuals, but it truly shines when it allows you to simply be a cat. Not only is it a fantastic game for cat and animal lovers, but it's also one of the most unique experiences in gaming yet.God is a Geek - Chris White - 9 / 10Stray is a delightful adventure game that strips away all the normal complications of the genre to offer an enjoyable overall experience.Guide Fall - Will Quick - 8 / 10It really feels like a cat’s journey, with some rich story-elements, and a nice balance between relaxed exploration and intense action sequences.Hardcore Gamer - Kyle LeClair - 4.5 / 5Looking past the fact that it features a kitty that can operate a vending machine, Stray boasts drop-dead gorgeous graphics, an intriguing story and unique post-apocalyptic world, and ridiculously fun and silky smooth gameplay that comes from climbing up and down every area possible with natural catlike agility. Stray is an absolute masterpiece that BlueTwelve should be proud of, and you'd be a fool to miss out on on no matter what, so make sure to check out this feline odyssey ASAP.Hobby Consolas - Alberto Lloret - Spanish - 90 / 100Stray is an indie adventure that it could be a Triple A game. It casts a cat as the main character, and focus on exploration and puzzles,. Not only has a superfab technical production, it also has an entertaining gameplay and a touching message. ¿The problem? When you finish it, will leave you wanting more... and it's not very long.IGN - Tom Marks - 8 / 10Stray is a delightful cat-based platforming adventure in a cyberpunk world worth exploring.IGN Italy - Angelo Bianco - Italian - 8.1 / 10Stray is not just a cat walking simulator, but a well-balanced adventure that turned out to be another winning bet for Annapurna Interactive. The merit of the success is to be attributed to Bluetwelve Studio, whose love for cats has allowed the French developers to create a very refined game in many respects. If you love cats and animals, don't miss Stray or you may regret it.IGN Korea - Sanghyun Bae - Korean - 8 / 10A wanderer cat In a gloomy and high-tech world is like a fairy tale and realistic imaginations combined. With a unique tone and a relatively short journey, each and every corner of the alley develops its own story to keep it extraordinarily interesting. With just the fact of maneuvering a life-size cat in a human world scale is already a fun feat, actions that can happen in our everyday lives but only if you were to live it or witness it as these many but little moments usually never catch our attention on a daily basis. This game creates that portal in which you are now able to see what happens in the blindspot as a usual experience. It may feel like a  quiet and stealthy journey but gradually creates a deep and pulsating experience that shakes our hearts like a wind chime that resonates in every silent atmosphere.IGN Spain - Rafa Del Río - Spanish - 8 / 10Stray writes a love letter to cats that serves as the wrapper for a delicious sci-fi bonbon filled with artistic nostalgia.Kakuchopurei - Jonathan Leo - 90 / 100Stray succeeds because it’s an engrossing adventure title with atmosphere, well-made aesthetics, a cool but not quite on-the-nose plot about a crumbled society trying to break out of its self-made chains, and some great adventure gaming gameplay that mixes puzzles with cat grace action. And it's a game made for cat people and lovers in mind.Kotaku - Ari Notis - UnscoredI went into Stray expecting a platformer about a cat. I did not expect a deeply profound meditation on what it means to be alive.MMORPG.com - Jason Fanelli - 8 / 10It's not going to unseat some of the bigger titles of the year, but as a fun and unique experience Stray is the cat's meow.Metro GameCentral - David Jenkins - 7 / 10A peculiar mix of cyberpunk dystopia and whimsical platformer that is just about held together by some excellent visuals and a very cute cat.New Game Network - Alex Varankou - 72 / 100Stray is a solid enough adventure game with archetypal mechanics and level design, elevated by its nice atmosphere and a unique perspective on the world.PC Gamer - Jon Bailes - 82 / 100Simple, polished systems allow Stray's rich fiction and charismatic star to shine.PCGamesN - Nat Smith - 9 / 10Stray merges feline mayhem with a classic cyberpunk setting, inviting you to explore its neon dystopia while never taking itself too seriously.PSX Brasil - Paulo Roberto Montanaro - Portuguese - 85 / 100Stray subverts our expectations by putting us through the unlikely point of view of a kitten with no fantastic powers or abilities on an exciting journey back to its home. With simple mechanics and impressive visuals, the game's great strength lies in the subtlety of a captivating narrative not because it humanizes the protagonist, but because it proposes us, for a few hours, to really look at that world through the kitten's eyes.Paste Magazine - Garrett Martin - 8.4 / 10B-12's memories are a kind of collectible you'll have to search for, and a few optional side-quests require scrounging up assorted bric-a-brac, but Stray doesn't make you wander about examining every nook and cranny for something you may or may not actually need. That's a good thing for a videogame, but if you were hoping to really just play as a cat doing cat-like things, ""pointlessly searching for stuff you don't need"" would be exactly what you wanted. The cat game might be less about the cat and more about the existential crises facing mankind and the artificial intelligences that will be left behind, but at least there's a dedicated meow button.PlayStation Universe - Adam Byrne - 9 / 10Stray has managed to meet the lofty expectations put upon it once it became known that you would take control of a lone cat within a dystopia punctuated by scores of neon lighting. While some may say that it's hard to miss with a setup like that, what developer BlueTwelve Studio has managed to fashion from the composite parts is something truly special and has us yearning for more.Polygon - Alexis Ong - UnscoredStray is the work of sly cat people, and it’s a triumphPress Start - Kieron Verbrugge - 9 / 10Stray is a brisk and relentlessly charming adventure that offers a very unique window into a gorgeous sci-fi world. It won't challenge your mind or your reflexes too much but it'll absolutely delight your senses. Importantly, it's a video game with a dedicated 'meow' button, and what could possibly be better than that?Push Square - Stephen Tailby - 8 / 10Despite one or two rough edges, Stray is a very enjoyable adventure. It's fairly straightforward, and gives you lots of opportunity to embody a cat, whether that's rubbing up against a robot's legs, clawing at furniture, or finding cosy places in which to snooze. The narrative doesn't quite reach the emotional hit it's looking for, but it slowly shows its hand throughout, with plenty of interesting details to learn. Pairing a common pet with moody sci-fi has worked well, resulting in a unique, engaging game with strengths that outshine its flaws.Rock, Paper, Shotgun - Katharine Castle - UnscoredA remarkable tale about the best cat in video games finding their way home through a dense and rich post-apocalypse. A must-play for cat lovers, and it also breaks new ground for action adventure fans.Screen Rant - Deven McClure - 4.5 / 5 Stray is a puzzle-platforming adventure game which offers players a one-of-a-kind feline science fiction experience that delights in every way.Shacknews - Bill Lavoy - 9 / 10When I watched the reveal trailer for Stray, I was expecting it to be fun to run around as a cat, and it is. What caught me off guard is just how detailed and thoughtful the experience was from start to finish. This game is both cute and entertaining, but there is real detail and passion on display that makes it so much more. Stray is a must-play for cat lovers, or anyone who just appreciates a stellar game.Sirus Gaming - Leif Rey Bornales - 9 / 10Overall, Stray has been quite an experience and I can say that it's one of those games that you'd really want to play if you enjoy a good story and exploration. It's a game for cat lovers, it's a game for cyberpunk lovers. It's a game for people who never stopped dreaming of getting out of a place they feel trapped in.Six One Indie - Harry Loizides - EssentialStray is simply captivating. Between unmatched world building, outstanding aesthetic design, intuitive cat physics, and immersive gameplay, BlueTwelve Studio and Annapurna Interactive have crafted an engaging and awe-striking experience from start to finish.Skill Up - Ralph Panebianco - UnscoredVideo Review - Quote not availableSpaziogames - Domenico Musicò - Italian - 7.5 / 10Stray reminds of the good old adventure games with puzzles and little sandbox sections. Besides the cute protagonist, you're gonna love the other characters and their stories.Stevivor - Steve Wright - 8 / 10Stray somehow manages to endear at the same time it feels like it's overstaying its welcome. At the end of the day, though, this cat-lover was won over by its sheer charm.TechRaptor - Austin Suther - 9 / 10Stray is an immersive and beautiful adventure game filled with so much detail and personality. Who knew solving puzzles as a cat could be so much fun?The Escapist - Elise Avery - UnscoredVideo Review - Quote not availableThe Games Machine - Francesco Alteri - Italian - 7.5 / 10Stray is an average game, a fairy tale about a missing kitten who wants to return to the surface. The scripted parts are also its strongest and most effective narratively, while the open areas feel much less focused. All in all, Stray is a simple, enjoyable game. Great for those looking for a nice adventure and a bit of social criticism.The Independent - Jasper Pickering - 8 / 10With Stray, BlueTwelve Studios and Annapurna Interactive have crafted a memorable experience that finishes just as it gets comfortable with its footing. But while it is short, it’s a testament to how the game looks, sounds and plays that it begs for more. Those who are curious to explore Stray’s world on Playstation can pick up a free copy with a PS Plus extra and/or premium subscription, making it a worthy addition to your digital library.TheSixthAxis - Tuffcub - 9 / 10Playing through the kitty cat adventure of Stray is an experience that's filled with joy and delight. I loved it, and so did my cat.Twinfinite - Alex Gibson - 4 / 5I’m very high on Stray overall, as you can probably tell by now. It might not quite have the substance and complexity in design to elevate the experience to genre-leading heights, but there’s so little to fault and so much to love about it that I’m certain, cat lover or not, it shouldn’t be missed. Stray is a superb achievement for a debut project from a studio in BlueTwelve that I cannot wait to see more from.Unboxholics - Σάκης Καρπάς - Greek - Worth your timeStray doesn't try to impress anyone, it's not full of fanfare, neither gameplay, nor design, and ultimately delivers a genuinely silent adventure with a Playdead-esque approach. It is a spare, thoughtful, smart and modern video game that questions, worries and sounds the alarm in a quiet and down-to-earth way. The title of the small French studio is not just a game starring a cat. It's something so much more that this year it's going to feature on many best games of 2022 lists…VG247 - Kelsey Raynor - 5 / 5 Stray might ultimately be indie in size, but it’s triple-A in quality, and while it may only last eight to 10 hours, it’s a game that has touched me for a lifetime.VGC - Chris Scullion - 5 / 5 Stray is a masterclass in environmental design, with one of the most engrossingly detailed game worlds we've explored. Like its protagonist it's a little on the short side, but what's here will stay with you for a long time. Essential.Video Chums - Mary Billington - 8.3 / 10Stray is a delightful adventure full of beautiful visuals and endearing characters. I thoroughly enjoyed my time exploring the post-apocalyptic city from the unique perspective of a feline who's dedicated to helping out the remaining robotic residents.Washington Post - Alyse Stanley - UnscoredFor a dystopian narrative, “Stray” isn’t interested in preaching to the player. It doesn’t try to make grand statements about mankind’s hubris or shortsighted innovation. Instead, it walks you through a living, breathing city where robots have molded their own society from the ashes of another, and lets players make of humanity’s self-destruction what they will. And that impression will stick with you long after the game ends.WellPlayed - Mark Isaacson - 9 / 10Stray is everything I wanted from it, an enjoyable and engaging journey across a well told tale that is every bit as cute as it is mysterious. More importantly, it made me feel empowered and brave in the face of uncertainty – I can’t remember the last time I’ve audibly cried out in delight so many times in the space of a few hours. Cuteness overload, no doubt.WhatIfGaming - Rizwan Anwer - 9 / 10Stray is a unique game that takes you on a brief yet memorable adventure through a multitude of settings, and characters, and most importantly, helps you appreciate the effort put in by the developers. I can safely say that Stray lived up to the hype, and delivered on one of the most definitive experiences in games that many gamers may dismiss in the paltry 10 or so hours to 100% the game, but you walk away with memories and something you will definitely cherish.",8 months ago,3.7k,1.1k comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/w235e6/stray_review_thread/
