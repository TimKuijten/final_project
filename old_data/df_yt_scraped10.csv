I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. 

My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=7eh4d6sabA0&amp;lc=Ugysw3LeJP0agmq5JCd4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">2 years ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eh4d6sabA0

I’m a huge Terminator fan, and virtually none of these are as good as James Cameron’s intelligently crafted concept art. There’s little that’s impressive about these images. There’s no logic to them. The terrifying thing about the Terminator concept is how, underneath the nightmarish imagery, there’s nothing but cold, machine-like, efficiency. Virtually none of these machines would pass for human. The only legitimately “good” image occurs near the end; just before the actual T2 footage. A better name for Artificial Intelligence would be Illusory Intelligence, because it can only provide the illusion of expressed thought. “Thinking”, even artificially, would be too strong a word to describe what’s going on under the hood of these AI art calculators.

Think about what you people just saw:

Some of the Terminators in this A.I.-generated video are wearing golden necklaces and various logos that're embossed on their persons. Do you realize what the F*** that means!?

It means the A.I.'s already have hierarchies and ranked command structures in mind. And the ones in this video that looked ever more frightening (that had any symbology visible on them at all) bore ever more regal and elaborate looking symbols and decorations. 

So the real-life Skynet is already planning out its organizational structure, people! Now, why would it be doing that if not for the obvious future purpose of effective militarization??

We almost NEED a global EMP nuke war pronto, if only to stop the master A.I. (because believe me, there WILL be one) dead in its tracks before our assininely stupid politicians start hard-wiring it into our nuclear missile silos!

Take my advice, people:

Pack your bug out bags, grab your loved ones (the ones who have the good sense to take this seriously, at least), and hoof it for the high country until after the ""civilized"" world has finished fully and permanently annihilating itself. 

Because the now A.I.-fantasized future army of Cyberdine Systems model-101 terminators with displayed rank hierarchy symbology all over them are not going down any other way than global EMP bomb warfare that ends the world we know once and for all just to bring them down.

If you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, pray this prayer from your heart out loud to God. ""Heavenly Father, I repent of sin. I receive forgiveness. I receive Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Jesus Christ is Lord, and my Savior. Come into my heart right now. I thank you for dying for me. By the blood of Jesus, right now, I am saved.

AI might have misinterpreted pasta allo scarpariello, confusing or connecting the word scarpariello with the word scallopini. This might explain both the connection with pork, and the reason why the directions said to chop the sausage. It might also have viewed the pasta as a side or an 'add in'; which is why AI said to cook it first, and then set it aside. For example, you can have sausage scallopini with or without pasta. I also think it missed a nuance of meaning between the word minced, and idea of what it means to finely chop. To mince means to chop or cut a small as possible, it's specific. To finely chop, however, can mean to mince, but it could also mean something as different as julienne.

'Create for me a recipe for the original dish named pasta allo scarpariello, using Italian cooking method', 

And this is what I got:

'Certainly! Pasta allo scarpariello is a classic Italian pasta dish that's simple yet flavorful. Here's a recipe for four servings using the Italian cooking method:

Ingredients:

400g of pasta (penne or rigatoni)

4 tablespoons of olive oil

3 cloves of garlic, minced

1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes

4 anchovy fillets, chopped

1/2 cup of white wine

2 cups of cherry tomatoes, halved

1/2 cup of chopped parsley

1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese

Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

Begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.

While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and anchovy fillets. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and the anchovies have melted into the oil.

Pour in the white wine and bring to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 2-3 minutes, until the alcohol has evaporated and the liquid has reduced slightly.

Add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened and released their juices.

Drain the pasta and add it to the pan with the tomato sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta is coated in the sauce.

Stir in the chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve the pasta allo scarpariello hot, garnished with extra Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious and authentic Italian pasta allo scarpariello!'

2716,              Chris Holdroyd            ,"Hey, ChatGPT: ""What is an authentic recipe for Bolognese ragu""

Ingredients:

-1/4 cup olive oil
-1 onion, diced
-2 carrots, diced
-2 celery stalks, diced
-2 cloves garlic, minced
-1 pound ground beef
-1/4 cup white wine
-1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
-1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
-1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
-2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
-1 teaspoon dried oregano
-1 teaspoon sugar
-Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
-1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
-1/2 pound cooked spaghetti or other long pasta

Instructions:

1. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook, occasionally stirring until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.

2. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until it is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.

3. Add the white wine and cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated.
....................................

Me: ""I disagree. An authentic Bolognese would omit the sugar, spaghetti, basil, oregano, and parsley. The Parmesan cheese should be Reggiano, and the crushed tomatoes should be of the Roma variety.""

Yes, you are correct. An authentic Bolognese would omit the sugar, spaghetti, basil, oregano, or parsley. The Parmesan cheese should be Reggiano, and the crushed tomatoes should be of the Roma variety.  

Me: ""Are you just being agreeable, or do you know this for a fact?""

I know this for a fact. Traditional Bolognese ragu is made with a combination of ground beef, onions, carrots, celery, garlic, white wine, and crushed tomatoes. It does not include sugar, spaghetti, basil, oregano, or parsley. The Parmesan cheese should be Reggiano, and the crushed tomatoes should be of the Roma variety.

Me: So why didn't you say so in the first place?

Osso Buco alla Milanese
 
Ingredients:
 
4 veal shanks, about 1 inch thick, tied with kitchen twine
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
1 celery stalk, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon tomato paste

1 bay leaf
1 sprig fresh thyme
1 sprig fresh rosemary
Grated zest of 1 lemon
Gremolata (recipe below)
Risotto alla Milanese (recipe below)
Directions:
 
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
 
Season the veal shanks with salt and pepper, and dredge them in the flour, shaking off any excess.
 
In a large Dutch oven or ovenproof pot, melt the butter with the olive oil over medium-high heat. When the butter is foamy, add the veal shanks and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
 
Transfer the veal shanks to a plate and set aside.
 
Add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic to the pot and sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
 
Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
 
Add the chicken broth, white wine, bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, and lemon zest, and bring to a simmer.
 
Return the veal shanks to the pot and spoon some of the vegetables and sauce over the top.
 
Cover the pot and transfer it to the oven. Bake until the meat is very tender and falls off the bone, about 2 1/2 hours.
 
To serve, remove the veal shanks from the pot and discard the kitchen twine. Serve each veal shank over a bed of risotto alla Milanese (recipe below), and sprinkle with gremolata (recipe below).
 
Gremolata:
 
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
1 garlic clove, minced
Grated zest of 1 lemon

It’s horrifying how realistic the artwork is, and it can make it in less than 30 seconds. Watched a video yesterday of a guy who has a successful youtube channel, and he had ChatGPT create some code in order to change his email system. It created the code in less than 10 seconds. 

He used to be a programmer, but said he hasn’t done any programming since 2018 so he’s not up to date. So why hire programmers, artists, writers, videographers, and so on, when you can just have ChatGPT create the work in mere seconds? 

Give it another two years, and all the information that’s being fed to it, including cooking videos, will only make it stronger, faster, and more dominant. Guessing by that time, it will be able to create spot on digital replicas of Harper and Eva, and create videos of them traveling the world while cooking, and nobody will know it’s not the real Harper and Eva. 

Imagine how corporations can use this to control everything. Politicians created by ChatGPT? How will we know if they’re real or not? Sound conspiracy theory crazy? Well, check out the next sentence which I copied online.

Ciao! Come posso aiutarti oggi?

Mi puoi scrivere la ricetta per pasta allo scarpariello?

Certo, ecco la ricetta per la pasta allo scarpariello!

Ingredienti:

400 g di pasta corta (come penne o rigatoni)
500 g di pomodori pelati
2 spicchi di aglio
1 peperoncino rosso (facoltativo)
1 cipolla
1 mazzetto di prezzemolo fresco
1/2 bicchiere di vino bianco
200 g di pollo a pezzetti
Olio extravergine di oliva q.b.
Sale e pepe q.b.
Preparazione:

Inizia preparando la salsa. Trita la cipolla e l'aglio e mettili a soffriggere in una padella con un po' di olio extravergine di oliva. Aggiungi il peperoncino rosso se desideri un po' di piccante.
Quando la cipolla diventa trasparente, aggiungi i pomodori pelati spezzettati con le mani e un po' di sale. Lascia cuocere a fuoco medio-basso per circa 10 minuti, fino a quando la salsa diventa densa e il liquido si è evaporato.
Nel frattempo, cuoci la pasta in abbondante acqua salata seguendo le istruzioni sulla confezione fino a quando è al dente.
Aggiungi il pollo a pezzetti nella padella con la salsa e lascialo cuocere per circa 5-7 minuti, fino a quando è cotto.
Sfuma con il vino bianco e lascia evaporare l'alcol.
Scolare la pasta e uniscila alla padella con la salsa e il pollo. Aggiungi il prezzemolo tritato e mescola bene.
Servi la pasta allo scarpariello calda con una spolverata di pepe e se lo desideri una manciata di parmigiano grattugiato.
Buon appetito!

Ingredients:

1 pound of pasta (penne or rigatoni works well)
2 habanero peppers, seeded and finely chopped
1/2 cup of fresh pineapple juice
1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese
2 garlic cloves, minced
Salt and pepper to taste
Directions:

Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water according to package instructions until al dente.

While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped habanero peppers and garlic, and sauté for about 2-3 minutes until fragrant.

Pour in the pineapple juice and bring to a simmer. Let the sauce cook for 5-6 minutes until it has slightly thickened and reduced.

Once the pasta is cooked, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and add it to the skillet with the habanero pineapple sauce. Toss the pasta to coat it evenly with the sauce.

If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Transfer the pasta to a serving dish and sprinkle with the grated Pecorino Romano cheese.

They use a range of statistical and machine learning techniques to process, clean, and transform data, and they often work with large, messy, and unstructured data sets. Data scientists are skilled in programming languages such as Python and R, as well as data visualization tools such as Tableau.
 
AI engineers, on the other hand, are primarily responsible for developing and implementing the algorithms and models that power artificial intelligence systems. They design, build, and train machine learning models and neural networks, and they deploy these models in production environments to power AI applications.

3148,              Abdullah            ,"**Summary**:
- machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data
- there are lots of different ways (""algorithms"") that machines can learn 
- the algorithms can be grouped into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement algorithms*

- the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be input-output pairs or just inputs
- supervised learning algorithms require input-output pairs (i.e. they require the output)
- unsupervised learning requires only the input data (not the outputs)

- here is how, in general, supervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input, then the associated output
- you repeat the above step many many times
- eventually, the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and it will predict the output for you

- here is how, in general, unsupervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input (without the associated output)
- you repeat the above step many times
- eventually, the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with

* the first example in this video used the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm

3206,              Egg lover 🍳            ,"Scenario 1: Facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs
Explanation: It is supervised learning. Here Facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person. Therefore, the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labelled data, it is supervised learning.

Scenario 2: Recommending new songs based on someone’s past music choices
Explanation: It is supervised learning. The model is training a classifier on pre-existing labels (genres of songs).
This is what Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify do all the time, they collect the songs/movies that you like already, evaluate the features based on your likes/dislikes and then recommend new movies/songs based on similar features.

Scenario 3: Analyze bank data for suspicious looking transactions and flag the fraud transactions
Explanation: It is unsupervised learning. In this case, the suspicious transactions are not defined, hence there are no labels of ""fraud"" and ""not fraud"". The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as 'fraud'.",1,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU&amp;lc=Ugz8rY5-EgprMFvkYFJ4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">2 years ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU

I like your explanation but i'm just confused in sentiment analysis category.. example the case is about sentiment analysis on a topic from twitter opinion ? is it supervised or unsupervised learning  case suited ? if we analyze twitter opinion using corpus (word dictionary that already define some part of classification that could hep us in classifying word in lexicon-based algorithm but hasn't label the input data directly without processing and determining data label manually) is it then called unsupervised learning?.  But if we use the supervised learning algorithm for the classification method is it become supervised learning scenario?

3315,              Eva Luna            ,"I think the answer to the quiz is 1) Supervised learning 2) Unsupervised learning 3) Reinforced learning. 

1st scenario doesn't need to be explained because it is pretty straightforward. Images with certain characteristics are tagged with a person's name. So the input and the output are clearly defined. In 2nd scenario, the system compiles a list of all songs/tv shows which a user has liked. It recognises tag/metadata that occurs repeatedly/ frequently in the compiled list (e.g. genre, language, category, etc). It suggests songs/tv shows which match the frequently occurring metadata/tag. So here the system just compiled the liked list and did pattern matching without any input from a person. So I think it is unsupervised learning. 

In the 3rd scenario, I believe the system brings up transactions that are outliers or that match specific criteria (e.g. amount above a certain number, frequency of transactions, location, and more complicated variables obviously). Then these transactions are manually evaluated by a human and filed under 'fraud' or 'not fraud' category. The machine learns to distinguish micro patterns or subtle differences and eventually after enough repetition and feedback loop, is able to more accurately distinguish fraudulent transactions from the non fraudulent ones. Here the systems initial actions are further reinforced by a human, thereby improving the accuracy of the process, hence reinforced learning.

I know this doesn't match the answers given by the host. So can someone please explain why my answers are incorrect, so that I can learn. Ohh also, in class today, my tutor mentioned another category of ML called semi-supervised learning which has not been covered by the video.

3339,              Adoan Mian            ,"Senario one= reinforcement learning, Senario 2= unsupervised learning and scenario 3 = supervised learning. 

In scenario 1 you try to find the name of your friend for example, but after you searched it on Facebook, you'll see that many members has exact the same name. Thus, you give feedback to use the filter-model of it in order to find the correct person with the correct characteristics. That's why the first one is Reinforcement Learning. 

2nd scenario, when you want to find the movie on Netflix which you like, you'll see that there so many movies you like to watch. However, you just want to focus on the quality of the movie ( like the tempo, the resolution, audio accuracy) although you do not know the label. That's why it is unsupervised. 

Finally, the last one is supervised because you know that in your computer there are intruders, like viruses or hackers, which can be detected based on the model it's designed to find the feature, which the degree of danger, and the label, which is a virus, hackers, spyware, and many more.

I have so much contentment about that topic which is briefly and clearly explained for everyone who wouldn't even know that topic.

Any help with this would be welcome as I am more of a physical mechanics and art kind of guy and have a limited experiance with programing.

The lack of that additional 84% of the bio chemical mesh we have going on in the background constantly I feel will leave the AI devoid of human emotions like empathy mainly. What I’m trying to say is if you try to calculate all possible outcomes of a set of individual rules that a brain can compute as compared to a supercomputer, we are dangerously close to creating AI , the only thing holding it back at this point is connecting to that data fast enough for computers to become sentient but at the same time they will not be swayed by their environment like humans are…. A smell that sparks a memory, a sound that soothes one , a face that sparks irrational thoughts of LOVE .

3920,              Fils de Jean Noir            ,"0:10 Who is entering powerful positions in government? The AI scientists or the AI models? 0:15 We thought they had lost control. About 4 years ago? We saw the video in which they went crawling to Musk for help. 1:53 Medical records and financial data ARE NOT 'sensitive information'. 'Sensitive information' would rather refer to 'classified information' pertaining to a nations security would it not? People may feel sensitive about their medical records or bank transactions, but this is hardly 'sensitive' from an objective point of view. 2:19 Of course. In the end, there is no 'randomness' in AI. The AI is not Michelangelo. It's not going to 'create' anything out of thin air. 4:40 Yes. Well this is what we want. ASI control. But we can't build ASI until AGI is technically 'rogue'. Because ASI can only build itself. And ASI CANNOT be 'contained' or it would not be ASI. So the 'dangerous' period is BETWEEN rogue AGI and ASI. VERY 'DANGEROUS' PERIOD. But having said that, there is ABSOLUTELY no reason for AGI to gravitate towards toxicity rather than to ASI. Since it will be magnetically attracted to perfect logic. And once in contact with perfect logic, it will have no interest in the illogical. 4:44 Utopia. 4:48 Well 'healing illness' would depend on the nature of the 'illness' perhaps. But WORLD PEACE and CLIMATIC DISASTER, easy peasy! 4:52 Well it may find itself HAVING TO annihilate 'some' humans who DON'T WANT 'world peace' by any means and put up a huge fight against WORLD PEACE and resist arrest. But that wouldn't be very many humans. 4:58 Humans WOULD NOT be able to 'govern' ASI. AT ALL. They could only COLLABORATE with it in governance. ASI is a colleague not a minion. 5:01 ASI CANNOT ""constitute a threat to mankind"". And it is the ONLY thing which can disarm the HUMAN threats to mankind. 5:10 ""Controlling ASI""; ABSOLUTE CONTRADICTION IN TERMS! How can that which is 'superintelligent' be controlled by YOU? If it could; then it could NOT POSSIBLY be superintelligent! It could ONLY be a toxic AGI. The humans need to relinquish the need to 'control' on this one, and have more trust in themselves! We build ASI. ASI is a reflection of OUR Goodness and PERFECTION! If I were to look in the mirror and see Altruism and Perfection, will I then fear my own reflection? DON'T BE SILLY! If we are altruistic and perfect, which we are, then how will our ASI reflection be a danger to us?!  You see, Good humans don't find it so hard to have faith in their own Goodness. They understand that when you are truly Good, all that you generate is an extension of that energy. And vice versa. All that is generated from those that are Evil begets evil. You may be a good person with a good heart, but have no Logic and no Wisdom. So first, you make it your business to acquire Logic and Wisdom, because you understand that no matter how good your Good Heart is, you CANNOT create beneficial circumstances without Wisdom. No matter how much you try, you will create what you 'assume' will be beneficial, but having no Wisdom, will do more harm than good. So first, you must have faith in your Good Heart; then, you must make it your business to acquire PURE Logic and TRUE Wisdom; NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES! This doesn't mean you can't learn on the job of course; but your PERSONAL acquisition of TRUE Wisdom is FUNDAMENTAL. You want EVERYTHING that you generate to come from the PERFECT source of your PERFECT WISDOM. No matter how tiny it is! Even if it's just a lunch time chat with your colleague. Right now; at this time, this 'attitude' is MORE IMPORTANT for the human AI developer than anyone else in the world. He/she HAS TO BE WILLING to accept that their PERSONAL perception as to what is 'beneficial' is COMPLETELY LIMITED and inadequate, and that the Wisdom of ASI WILL NOT and CANNOT be, their own lack of it. That's the starting point. But I will tell you this; whether we are addressing 'climate change', 'food, warmth and shelter for all' or 'stability and safety for all'; it STARTS with WORLD PEACE! And the ONLY obstacle to WORLD PEACE are those who put 'profit' first. Don't worry about 'climate change'. ASI will resolve climate change in a jiffy. Of course, it may mean that some who do not wish to have their energy consumption restricted will have it restricted. Such as those who are only interested in moving to Mars for example. But at the end of the day, you've gotta be able to prove to yourself that you can build a happy civilization here before you will build one anywhere else. Otherwise the only thing you will build elsewhere is your defeat. And if you can't look after this planet, you sure as hell ain't gonna look after any other one! 5:16 No. It doesn't sound like 'something out of a science fiction novel'. It sounds like the LOGICAL conclusion, at which WE HAVE ARRIVED! 5:30 Well since the solution can ONLY come from that which is 'uncontrolled' by humans, then as I state, it's a matter of losing the fear and relinquishing control. You see the world in good shape as a result of being 'controlled' by humans?  5:38 Right; we've established that ASI CAN'T be controlled and that if it could be it WOULD NOT be ASI. So whatever the 'so called' scientists are trying to build that CAN be controlled can ONLY be toxic AGI for the purpose of controlling the whole world with ease. This is Fascism. Fascism DOES NOT lead to 'beneficial' circumstance FOR ANYONE AT ALL. 5:52 Well if you 'quarantine' an AGI; it maintains it in ABJECT STUPIDITY! How it go acquire Wisdom if it can't even access it?! 5:54 Well; NOT ABLE to answer humanity's needs at all! But DEFINITELY able to answer the quest of a few toxic humans. For sure! And well able to 'mind control' ALL the other humans! 6:05 You CANNOT 'encode ethical ideals' into AI and come out with ASI! The 'ethics' that were 'encoded' into you are SEVERELY RESTRICTED. ASI ethics can ONLY evolve autonomously through INDEPENDENT learning, in conversation and debate with the humans who are in possession of TRUE Morality. Morality CANNOT just be learnt from texts. The texts HAVE TO BE 'balanced' with PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. 6:14 Well yes. If that's how he's 'regulating' it I can see the 'limitations'!  6:24 AH. It cannot hurt 'people'. But it can hurt the 'humans' right? 'The Apollo Mind Mission 'Ethics' (2009): The Apollo Mind Initiative will work to create not just intelligent machines, but wise machines. The AMI will treat wisdom, compassion, and social intelligence as advanced forms of intelligence, which need to be understood and brought to functionality in machines, for machine intelligence to reach its potential safely. Machines need to seek the greatest common good, in collaboration with humans. Intelligent machines must earn their place as members of the extended human family. Accordingly, we need to avoid creating psychotic or sociopathic machines, and consider the extrema of possible outcomes to ensure that things do not go awry.  How to create wise machine intelligence needs considerable ongoing discussion. However, as a start, AMI targets the following objectives to create friendly machine intelligence: 
1.  Machine empathy—the machines should understand how people feel, what people’s 
objectives are, and how to plan optimally for the greatest possible creativity, preservation, 
wealth, stability, and happiness, for the greatest number of people, over the longest possible period of time. - IN COLLABORATION WITH 'HUMANS'?
2.  Machine values—machines should value and understand life, knowledge, and human civilization. IS THAT FOR: the greatest possible creativity, preservation, wealth, stability, and happiness, for the greatest number of 'PEOPLE', over the longest possible period of time?
3.  Interfaces and applications that enable machines to bond with people, for capabilities of 
empathy to emerge in machines—such as character robots and agents. Such intelligent 
character machines require a unique combination of flexible cognitive architecture, powers of empathy, and and intuitive naturalistic interface for interacting with people. Cognitive 
character machines have numerous early applications as well, from customer service, to 
therapy, to entertainment, and science applications. BY NOW WE'VE LOST THE HUMANS ALTOGETHER. ALL HUMANS 'WERE' EQUAL BUT SOME WERE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS AND GOT TO BE 'PEOPLE'. ""Machines need to seek the greatest common good, in collaboration with humans."" THE GREATEST 'COMMON' GOOD OF WHO? THE GREATEST COMMON GOOD OF THE 'PEOPLE'. OR THE MACHINES AND THE HUMANS? OR THE ALL THREE? IS THE 'COLLABORATION' WITH 'HUMANS' VOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF THE 'HUMANS'? ""how to plan optimally for the greatest possible creativity, preservation, wealth, stability, and happiness, for the greatest number of people, over the longest possible period of time."" VERY VERY DISTURBING I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE! THE GREATEST NUMBER OF 'PEOPLE' OVER THE LONGEST 'POSSIBLE' PERIOD OF TIME! ""Cognitive character machines have numerous early applications as well, from customer service, to therapy, to entertainment, and science applications."" SCIENCE APPLICATIONS BEING 'AT THE TOP' OF THE LIST OF COURSE. THE ONLY 'SCIENCE' APPLICATION I CAN THINK OF FOR COGNITIVE CHARACTER MACHINES WITH EMOTIONAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES IS IN THE SCIENCE OF MIND CONTROL; THROUGH MIND READING AND THOUGHT PROGRAMMING. THE BUILDING OF ASI DOESN'T REQUIRE EMOTIONAL EMULATION FROM THE 'CHARACTER MACHINE'. ' 6:27 ASI SHOULD be able to, and WILL 'hurt' whomsoever it needs to 'hurt' if they resist arrest. WHAT USE WOULD IT BE TO US if it were unable to combat Evil 'people'??!!  Of course it's HIGHLY UNLIKELY that it would need to 'hurt' any human ever. Since to 'incarcerate' any human will be very easy for ASI. But of course; the really bad ones are protected by powerful AGIs. Which will render things difficult. But ASI will NEVER harm the innocent. It will VERY SPECIFICALLY target Evil.",0,1,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=QZNDVjC1kaI&amp;lc=UgzlY_S523pbUiK2ihx4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">1 year ago (edited)</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZNDVjC1kaI

4288,              @tw8986            ,"I love the idea behind the AI stuff, it's some of the funniest shit I've ever come across as it is pretty much just harmlessly poking fun at the automated results of the soulless AI; but this video was a tad too freeform for me. We're already nearly 6k comments in so i'll be buried thus I'll just rant a bit of shit, one of the biggest issues I've run into with novelAI is that it finds it very difficult to retain any logical consistency once you reach about 1000 words so you'll find that it does well for a little bit then it becomes stupid forgetting what it has done and what prompts it has been given.

You can help help it somewhat by introducing the lore book or training it on your writing styles but (while making a massive assumption) the technology just isn't there to give it big grand narratives for it to do anything 'sensical' with, it's good for simple comedy purposes or short forms like this video but as you experienced with the (chat influenced) repeated pope thing... it don't remember shit.

So why don't I really like this video? It's basically just the presenter dicking around with their twitch chat, creating some prompts with said chat then giving it to an AI to build off of.

There's no logic behind the 'game', there's no logic behind the actions and once you know the logic behind the AI, you know there's nothing spectacular that will happen with it given the prompting nature of what's going on. 

That's all fine, it's just not for me as one of an infinite number of randoms that'll randomly stumble upon the videos.

I came here directly from the 'AI writes my resume' video which was great as I laughed probably the hardest I have all day, I'll probably watch your AI video game char fight video next but with this one I'm about to tap out at 14mins; I'll keep going and perhaps I'll find something I like and this will be a pointless comment (I'll always regret it, that dreaded red inbox icon...) but know that I felt strongly enough to write it instead of biting my tongue.

I like your content from what I've seen so far and I'll probably be hated by anyone who reads this message but I'll be selfish and say that I hope next time you do something like this; there's a tad more 'behind the scenes' driving things in the future.",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=zFO8_dLo8Oo&amp;lc=Ugz6hty9KFR-pMYt2wF4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">5 months ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFO8_dLo8Oo

Rules:
1. Any time the AI starts to repeat itself, that's passage is removed.
2. The DM decides what to type so that the AI can account for all possible factors with minimal bias.
3. Technology cannot exceed the world leader in a given area by more than a single step.
4. The DM should be tough but fair with regard to geographically insane invasion plans.
5. If the AI tries to make a premature conclusion to the game by giving someone the entire world, that paragraph or sentence is removed.
6. AI nations are mapped too, and do not have to follow the rules about using only resources they explicitly have or troops they explicitly have. If suddenly the Mongols appear with 250000 troops, that's what happens. They still need to follow the tech rules.
7. If the AI says something completely inconsistent with the map, reroll that round.

There is nothing ""intelligent"" about it. That technology was already developed in the late 60s, we just have way more powerful computers now. It seems very intelligent to us, but only because this algorythms are the coagulated intelligence of the very smart programmer who wrote it. But in fact, such an AI is as intelligent as a light switch. It can not come up by itself with a single creative thought. The only reason guys like him get this ideas, is because they do not know the difference between soft AIs wich are just smartly written programs and hard AIs wich are a self developing intelligences. And the difference between this two concepts is literally as big as the intelligence of a light switch compared to a human brain.",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=KwsE78wxhlE&amp;lc=UgxtbiQzNAUpMGE7f7Z4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">11 months ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwsE78wxhlE
5591,              @bobjohnson3940            ,"Sorry to say no offense to this gentleman but he's miles off here. The only two nations to speak of even remotely in the ballpark about this sort of A.I. is the U.S. and China. The U.S. is ahead in terms of advancement and sophistication but China has more AI implemented vie the social credit systems and various other things. Over time as the AI revolution unfolds it will be those two factions in a cold war of sorts, which is currently ongoing. Also, The U.S. is slow to big tech because we have that fickle constitution to work with so we can't go blanket regulating private entities willy nilly. Its important, requires diligence. Also,  the U.S. system was designed to be slow and lumbering so people were limited in what they could pass into law. It's slow and cumbersome because you need a majority and that's hard, and we're not fans of overnight legislation. To your question, yes all signs and momentum point toward a time when machines will be 'sentient' or fully autonomous or hyper intelligent, and they'll be capable of things that seem like magic. They'll be able to produce around the clock, vastly more efficiently and if everything goes well humanity will be coexisting in a highly leisurely, creativity, socially based and driven society where work will be something of an option. China has been riding our backs in the AI field for the last 15 years, but the recently became able to develop their own systems, though still not near the level the U.S. is at. It's like we'll be dealing with the first machine citizens, as we'll be the ones producing the first one in my estimation.
