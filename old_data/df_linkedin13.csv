In everything we do, we will certainly face obstacles, challenges, surprises, and hardships.Even with the best of planning, hiccups can happen.Education prepares us for the journey, but it is experience that will see us through.We learn more from our failures than from our successes.With acquired knowledge and wisdom, we are better able to handle future opportunities.If you have a dream, pursue it.

Early on in their journey, an aspect they felt was important was measuring how colleagues feel about the changes being implemented as a result of the transformation. They use the Kubler-Ross change curve as a guide.Using the Change Journey Navigator insights tool, they are able to establish the impact of the changes by monitoring how the communication is landing with colleagues and thereby understand where to focus attention to improve clarity and increase engagement.An important end result is to have everyone across the company feeling they are part of the change, empowered to re-imagine their roles to better serve their customers, their suppliers and each other.Click for more info on the event:https://lnkd.in/eG8mNgr7For more information on Change Journey Navigator go to:https://lnkd.in/e8muSMGT",25 minutes ago

Michael Watson,4,,1 repost,"In February 2021, Spotify announced a policy that allowed their employees to work from anywhere. Spotify's results at the 18-month juncture are summarized in the World Economic Forum video (link is below).A few highlights of the impact of this change include:Staff turnover dropped by 15%. This is probably the result of employees having access to a desirable level of flexibility.Between 2019 and 2021, women in leadership increased from 25% to 42%. In surveys, women have indicated less interest in coming into an office to work and greater interest in balancing their personal life and work responsibilities. The work from anywhere policy meets those needs.Black and Hispanic staff grew from 12.7% to 18%. Another advantage of this policy is that it enables Spotify to recruit employees from anywhere in the country, without the requirement of moving to a central location. If everything is equal, an organization that allows you to take a new job while remaining near family and friends is more attractive than a job offer that requires you to move. This policy makes recruiting and retaining diverse staff easier.This new policy does not appear to have affected Spotify's subscriber growth. At the end of January, Spotify became the first music streaming service to surpass 200 million paid subscribers.Spotify has demonstrated what is possible when you offer policies that meet the needs of employees.https://buff.ly/3Lo823V#leaders#leadership#managers#management",44 minutes ago

It is a pretty simple shell script, but the greater point is that the organization has offered this type of recovery tool at all.In the past, most government organizations have taken a hands-off approach to assisting victims, other than investigations of criminal activity. This new approach is welcome, I think, because the market hasn't produced accepted options for recovery tools. Of course, you can engage, and probably should engage, your cyber insurance and incident response providers when help is needed.

Doing so could involve:•	Further investment in training.•	Building up stress and scenario analysis capabilities.•	Enhancing governance structures to ensure effective oversight of climate risks.The report notes that firms need sufficient controls to avoid requiring a greater quantum of capital.The report highlights the need for firms to take climate risks seriously and build the necessary capabilities to manage them effectively to comply with regulatory expectations and protect their businesses from potential financial losses associated with these risks.To learn how ORIC International supports its members on climate-related risks, scenario analysis, and capital benchmarking, contactenquiries@oricinternational.comtoday.

Only 1 out of every 3 neurodivergent Canadian is employed. ""Unhireable,"" they are deemed, or ""too expensive to accommodate.""So let's talk business:💡 A report by JPMorgan Chase found that professionals in its Autism at Work initiative made fewer errors and were 90% to 140% more productive than neurotypical employees.💡 A report by Deloitte found that companies with inclusive cultures were six times more likely to be innovative and agile.💡 Thanks to Silicon Valley, the technology that rules everything around you is in large part the product of ND ingenuity.Companies like SAP, HP, Microsoft, Willis Towers Watson, Ford, and EY have reformed their HR processes in order to tap into neurodiverse talent. Dell, Deloitte, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, and UBS have start-up or exploratory efforts underway.What does this mean?

I've seen this in action, and it is AWESOME. We are in beta now, and the blind and low-visioned community, through Be My Eyes, will help shape this great leap forward for world-wide accessibility.Users can send images via our app to an AI-powered Virtual Volunteer, which will answer any question about that image and provide instantaneous visual assistance for a wide variety of tasks. What sets the Virtual Volunteer tool apart from other image-to-text technology available today is superior recognition and context, a deeper level of understanding, and a conversational ability not yet seen in the digital assistant field. For example, if a user sends a picture of the inside of their refrigerator, the Virtual Volunteer will not only be able to correctly identify what’s in it, but also extrapolate and analyze what can be prepared with those ingredients and offer a recipe - almost instantaneously.This is the result of immense hard work and forward thinking byAndré,Aske,Jesper,Hans,Bryan,Christian, our CEOMichaeland the entire Be My Eyes team. We think it is a great step forward for the community we are proud to serve, and we have created a waiting list in our app where people who are blind or low-vision can sign-up to test drive the Virtual Volunteer tool.If you want to learn more visit our blogpost.https://lnkd.in/gEB5q8yZ.#community#accessibilitymatters#Inclusion#AI#CSUN2023",

Karen W. Smith,"56,946","1,612 comments","12,586 reposts","Black women’s hair is 2.5x more likely to be perceived as unprofessional. Because of this, 2/3 of Black women change their hair for a job interview. The pressure is even higher for young professionals, as nearly half (44%) of Black women under 34 feel pressured to have a headshot with straight hair.Bias and discrimination against natural hairstyles in the workplace remains a systemic problem, with a disproportionate impact on Black women. No one should be denied access to employment opportunities or professional advancement because of their hair. That’s why Dove co-founded the CROWN Coalition to help make race-based hair discrimination illegal through the CROWN Act. We’ve made great progress, but there’s still work to be done.I’m excited to announce that Dove is partnering with LinkedIn–the world’s largest professional network–in support of the CROWN Act, to create more inclusive and equitable spaces for Black hair at work. Dove will continue to drive awareness for the CROWN Act, encourage petition signatures, and advocate for legislation to end hair discrimination nationwide, and together with LinkedIn, take a series of actions to help end race-based hair discrimination in the workplace:Provide free access to 10 LinkedIn Learning courses focused on creating a more equitable work environment, with a goal to educate 1 million hiring managers and professionals by the end of 2023.Illuminate the real and measurable adverse impact hair discrimination continues to have on Black women in the workplace through the CROWN 2023 Workplace Research StudyAmplify the real stories and voices of Black women to help redefine what society deems “professional” for the workplaceTogether, we are reinforcing and celebrating that#BlackHairIsProfessional.Join us in taking action.

Juan José Mateo - Spanish SEO Writer,"1,719",273 comments,52 reposts,"2013: decido irme de España ante la falta de oportunidades. Apenas consigo unas prácticas mal pagadas y sin ningún tipo de beneficio. Hago las maletas y me voy a Argentina.2014: me echan de mi primer trabajo en agencia, no supero el periodo de prueba, es primer trabajo desde que estoy en Buenos Aires (bueno, mi primer trabajo, a secas). Me costó encontrarlo 6 meses.2015: doy el salto a otra agencia, esta vez con un gran cliente (enorme, más bien), pero me pagan una miseria. Paso un año durísimo a nivel económico, aunque aprendo una barbaridad. Me adapto al país, comienzo a hacer amigos.2016: doy el salto a una multinacional, esta vez con un sueldo digno. Me ascienden antes de cumplir el año y me convierto en líder de área. Doy un salto a nivel económico y de responsabilidad. Ya estoy plenamente adaptado.2018: rechazo una gran oferta para ser líder regional de otra multinacional. Decido volver a Europa. Me despido de grandes amigos, es duro. Me voy directo a Escocia. Empiezo en un trabajo random de subtitulado de videojuegos. Me pagan poco y es inestable. Me cuesta encontrar otro trabajo, pero lo logro y termino en otra agencia.2019: el trabajo no es lo que esperaba y me voy de Glasgow. Viajo a España, comienzo en el mundo freelance. Intento montar una agencia con otros profesionales, pero no sale bien.2020: sigo como freelance, pero ahora contratan mis servicios grandes marcas. Lo hago todo a la sombra, sin firmar nada, sin crear mi marca personal.2022: despierto del letargo. Comienzo a desarrollar mi marca, mi método, y empiezo a formar a otras personas con todo lo que he aprendido como copy y como profesional. Consigo el tan ansiado equilibrio dinero-trabajo-tiempo libre.2023: continúo con mi estrategia. Gane, pierda, tenga pereza o haga frío. En 9 meses doblo mi cantidad de seguidores y consigo 2 MM de impresiones. Lanzo mi newsletter y comparto contenido a diario. Sigo aprendiendo, enseñando y conectando. Otros profesionales comienzan a notar los beneficios de mis asesorías.Una verdadera montaña rusa.Pero la vida es esto.Altibajos.Y eso es algo que todos tenemos que pasar, a menos que hayas nacido en cuna de oro, en cuyo caso este post no te va a despertar nada.Pero si no es así, si has tenido que ganarte lo que disfrutas hoy, sabes perfectamente que el camino siempre es complicado.Y si todavía estás en ese camino, este post es un aviso de que vas a tener momentos malos, momentos regulares y momentos buenos.Puedes optar por tirar la toalla ante la primera adversidad.O puedes tomarlo como parte del camino y seguir el consejo de mi camiseta.Te aseguro que si optas por lo segundo, va a valer la pena.Mucho.P.D. Me encantaría conocer tu historia en comentarios. A veces tenemos miedo a contar lo que hemos pasado para llegar dónde estamos, cuando en realidad es lo más inspirador que podemos regalarle a otra persona.#trayectoria#mihistoria",

Make UK Defence,11,,1 repost,"Ahead of today’s Spring Budget and following the measures announced in the Integrated Review Refresh,Make UK DefenceDirector-GeneralAndrew Kinniburghhas made the following comment:“Make UK Defence welcome the much needed increase in defence spending in today’s budget. Well done to Rt Hon Ben Wallace MP and Alex Chalk MP for securing funding at a critical juncture. We welcome as well the commitment to spending of 2.5% of GDP on defence going forward. With paradigm shifting international programmes such as the AUKUS submarine deal and the Global Combat Air Programme, ambitious and rigorous investments in future capabilities are a necessity. The war in Ukraine has changed the world, and the UK must be pro-active in facing threats.And yet, whilst this is a good step forward, there is yet more to do. Our army’s equipment lags behind many of our NATO allies. The threats since the original iteration of the Integrated Review have dramatically increased. Greater, bolder commitments are needed to deliver the support our armed forces need.”https://lnkd.in/ePWYnVYE#ukmanufacturing#ukmfg#springbudgetJames WatsonKelly MaddisonSamantha HillEstelle ExelbyMaria WinsperCharline DiomandeJames V.",2 hours ago

Today, I humbly ask for your help in a mission that is close to my heart. ❤️As a retired NYPD Sergeant, I have dedicated my life to upholding the law and advocating for the truth.Now, I am on a journey to bring my second case beforeThe Supreme Court of the United States, where I hope to secure justice for all those who have faced similar challenges.Achieving justice in my case will pave the way for countless others across the United States who face similar struggles. Together, we can create a brighter, fairer future for all. 🇺🇸The road to justice is a long and winding one, filled with financial hurdles that can be overwhelming.Legal fees, court costs, and other expenses have piled up, and I need your support to help me cross the finish line.The Supreme Court's strict requirements have created an additional burden. For instance, printing and typesetting the necessary 40 booklets amounts to nearly $2,000, an expense that cannot be shouldered alone.But with your support, we can make a difference. Every donation, no matter how small, brings us one step closer to realizing our goal.And if you cannot contribute financially, simply sharing our story with your network can have a profound impact.Your generosity and solidarity in this fight for justice will be a beacon of hope and a testament to the power of community.Together, we can make the world a more just and equitable place.Thank you, and may God bless you for your kindness.🌟 Support our Fundraiser for Justice through PayPal: Can you help Retired NYPD Sergeant Fundraiser For Justice on PayPal Fundraisers?

Letícia Tainara Souza,6,3 comments,,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, histórico de tendências e evoluções, aqui vão algumas das tendências de marketing para 2023:🤳🏻 Marketing de influência: o marketing de influência chegou pra ficar e continuará a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conteúdo para alcançar públicos específicos (Ó a base da Virginia aí, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).🎁 Personalização: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experiência personalizada e relevante, e as empresas estão investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estratégias para atender a essa demanda.📼 Vídeo marketing: o vídeo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produção de vídeo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Então investe nisso. A era dos estáticos morreu).🔊 Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas estão começando a adotar estratégias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personalização também).📩 Marketing de conteúdo: este continuará a desempenhando um papel importante na construção de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom! Se você é um profissional da área, sugiro começar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estratégias e tomadas de decisão. Pois como diz a famosa música de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por aí, ""hoje é um novo dia, de um novo tempo que começou. Todos os nossos sonhos, serão verdade e o futuro já começou"".#marketing#tecnologia#amazon#empresas#salesforce#marketingsensorial#marketing2023#marketingderelacionamento",2 hours ago

Rick Watson,71,49 comments,3 reposts,"5 Scary Things I Learned While Shopping Amazon Buy With PrimeI've been surprised so many people talking about Buy With Prime, but few of them actually have even ever looked at it, much less purchased from a seller with it.  I decided to remedy that.To make it easy on Amazon, and perhaps prove a point, I decided to throw them a softball.  Let's purchase from their case study accounts.  Here's what I learned.  In the comments, I have the full report and a link to signup to my newsletter which will release it this morning.  (So signup to get future content like this!)Note when I say all their sellers  I mean all their case study sellers.1 - All their sellers are using FBA vs their white-label MCF shipping.This means the packaging is bad, undifferentiated, and worse than any typical premium D2C experience.2 - All their sellers are using Shopify.If you wonder why Amazon needs to sign a deal with Shopify, look no further.  In the sweet-spot of D2C small and medium businesses that Buy With Prime could help, anecdotally I find like 90% of these people are using Shopify.So yeah, Amazon must get a deal done.3 - Buyers need to agree to Amazon's privacy policyThis is not just about fast delivery, then.  (Which was fantastic!) This is about data-sharing.I doubt this would even work in Europe.4 - I never got a branded e-mail from a Shopify store.When I was contacted during the purchase experience, they were all from either Amazon itself, or ""Amazon Pay"" (to be honest, I am not sure why there is a difference the consumer should see).Only one brand in all my purchases sent me a single email before I got the item, and it was to tell me they had created an account for me, and to reset my password for it.Thanks for nothing?5 - Returns were hard.  Like super-hard.Both Amazon customer service and the D2C brands I purchased from could barely find these orders in their database, much less tell me how to return them successfully.I did not feel like I had an ""A to Z Guarantee.""Suffice to say, if I were a buyer of a brand, there is zero advantage to buying with Buy With Prime for the same item that could be on Amazon.  In fact, if the item is already on Amazon, Buy With Prime on a D2C website adds significant friction.If the item is not on Amazon, then you lose the ease of your typical D2C experience.👇👇Want more?
