Salomé Lannier,22,2 comments,3 reposts,"Hi network!I am happy to share my first English paper, published by eucrim! A big thanks toAnna Pingenfor her help!In a nutshell: (human trafficking + artificial intelligence) x US = questioning European sovereigntiesDon't hesitate to contact me if you have any feedback on this paper/topic!Here is the full abstract: Human trafficking is keeping pace with new technologies, but so is its repression. Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) systems support the daily work of law enforcement authorities in detecting and investigating trafficking schemes. These systems were developed, and are used primarily, in the United States of America (US). As the fight against human trafficking is a worldwide priority, they are often exported from the US or replicated. Yet, so far, little research has been done to examine how (US) policies and values might be embedded in these specific systems. This article argues that the spread of US tools using artificial intelligence to combat human trafficking hinders the autonomy of foreign States. Particularly in the European context, these tools might challenge national criminal sovereignty as well as Europe’s digital sovereignty. The article highlights the US policies surrounding human trafficking that are embedded in these AI systems (legal definition, political priorities and decisions) and the lack of adequate consideration of existing European standards. These are meant to protect human rights while developing and using AI systems, i‧e. the protection of personal data and control over technical standards.Here is the full paper:https://lnkd.in/ddAjppw6Spoiler alert: another paper should be published soon on the European regulation of this kind of algorithm (although in French this time)!#humantrafficking#ai#sovereignty#legal#research",16 hours ago

"Sergio Alvarez-Teleña, PhD",13,1 comment,2 reposts,"I tend not to talk much about AI. I rather use the term ML. But yesterday we had this visit from a couple of interesting people at SciTheWorld - an advisor to the CEO of an IBEX company and the former president of theInter-American Development Bank, Enrique V Iglesias - and I found myself talking about the definition of ""intelligence"".I always say the same: I pretty much accept any definition for intel. It looks to me rather a philosophical discussion so I am not bold enough to enumerate the different dimensions of the concept as a closed-form solution.But that brainstorming made me think of another way to define intelligence. Instead of benchmarking the intel of the machine against that of the human it looks to me that it is easier, at this point, to do it the other way around. Why not? Nevertheless, it is more difficult for me to define the intel of a human than that of a machine.Hence: ""Intelligence is a process that cannot be achieved by machine learning yet. The creativity that figures out the out-of-sample even when it only accounts for small data. The process that discounts the change of the distribution that generates the data with little context. The one that adds orthogonal value in a non-random manner. And one that does it all at the lowest energy consumption"". Pretty much.At our Centre of Excellence we are tackling the out-of-sample (the awarded VR Simulation) and the context (the different dimension-driven approaches that we are publishing and are still researching on).With regards to small data we still need the combination human-machine, Augmented Machines, as in the paper of ""Advances in Portfolio Management: On-Platform Governance for Portfolio Managers"", since we can't figure it out yet. And pretty much the same for the energy consumption - our brain is a massive machine utterly efficient. So... we are very far, at least from this point of view, to call what we have anything near to Artificial Intelligence.Plus, to be fair, no one is really investigating that. We are still focused on ML - which, for the time being, is good enough!",13 hours ago

Ignasi Henry Batlle Daniel,2,1 comment,,"Digital transformation is an essential process in the current era of technology and business. Companies that do not adopt digital transformation run the risk of falling behind and losing their competitive advantage. One way to achieve digital transformation is through the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in a company's departments.Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that require human intelligence, such as learning, perception, natural language understanding, and decision-making. In the business realm, AI can be used to automate processes, reduce costs, improve efficiency, and increase accuracy in decision-making.One department in a company where AI can be successfully applied is the human resources department. With the help of AI, human resources departments can automate candidate selection, analyze employee performance, and predict job satisfaction. AI can also be used to improve employee experience by providing quick answers to frequently asked questions and eliminating the need for manual tasks.Another department that can benefit from the application of AI is the marketing department. AI can be used to analyze customer and market data, enabling marketing departments to personalize marketing and advertising strategies, increase ROI, and improve customer retention. AI can also be used to improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns through sentiment analysis, image recognition, and audience segmentation.The finance department can also leverage AI to automate manual tasks, improve accuracy, and reduce the risk of human errors. AI can be used to predict cash flow, analyze expenses, and provide recommendations to optimize financial management. Additionally, AI can be used to detect fraud and prevent financial losses.In conclusion, digital transformation is an essential process for companies seeking to maintain their competitive advantage in the current market. The application of AI in a company's departments can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase accuracy in decision-making. The human resources, marketing, and finance departments are just a few examples of departments that can benefit from AI. Companies that adopt AI can achieve a competitive advantage in the market and improve their long-term profitability.#marketing#inteligenciaartifical#bussines#negocios#technology#data",6 hours ago

Patrick Luiz De Oliveira,3,,,"So with the release of#GPT4, we see a troubling trend withOpenAI.First, it was a non-profit whose stated purpose was to democratize AI.Then, as soon as the market showed interest, it switched to a ""capped-profit"" model (basically a jargony way of saying that the company is for-profit, but if it becomes extremely profitable it will pass on anything that goes above 100x return to the non-profit appendage).And now, with the latest release, we see the company becoming more secretive about the system's architecture.Despite howOpenAIframes itself, the behavioral trend is not that of an organization committed to the democratization of AI (which in principle should include robust oversight and public deliberations tackling if and how this technology should be implemented) but that of an organization committed to the marketability of its product.

Paula Hernández Tomás,9,,,"🤖⁉️ Is artificial intelligence (AI) changing the game?Until now it was often claimed that there was still a long way to go before the machine replaced the interpreter, but this does not seem to be so far off.Apparently, Skype has launched a real-time translation feature. It works with speech recognition and natural language processing technology that identifies the spoken words and interprets them into the desired language. In addition, AI will also be used to adjust the translation so that it sounds like the speaker’s own voice, with the aim of making it seem more “human”.There is no doubt that technology is advancing by leaps and bounds and this could pose a threat to the profession. However, it is all about the approach we take to it as a community. We don't have to see it as an enemy. Denial won’t help. Everything will depend on the context and very specific parameters for an appropriate application of AI.Even so, AI will have to overcome numerous challenges to remain in the market. Among them, I can think of the fact that it is very common for many of the speakers to speak in a language that is not their mother tongue, therefore different accents and pronunciations could be an obstacle in this case. Also, the need to adapt to the speaker’s register and to capture their emotions, or the overlaps that often occur between interventions.Above all, we need to show our value as human interpreters. We ensure that participants are able to engage interactively within the room and we have the ability to look beyond the words, to the message and the argument. Interpreters often need to interpret the unsaid.Certainly, we will have to wait and see how this technology develops and embrace the possible changes.🗨️ What are your thoughts on this matter?

De asistentes virtuales a aplicaciones capaces de crear impresionantes imágenes a partir de un entrada de texto o redactar ensayos enteros siguiendo nuestras instrucciones, estas herramientas ya nos acompañan y prometen revolucionar la manera en que los humanos trabajamos.Una de ellas es GPT, un sofisticado desarrollo de la organización OpenAI que está por estrenar su nueva versión GPT-4.GPT significa Generative Pre-trained Transformer (algo así como un transformador generativo pre-entrenado), es decir un modelo de lenguaje autorregresivo que utiliza el machine learning para simular de manera efectiva el modo en que escribimos los humanos.Al igual que sus antecesores, GPT-4 es una red neuronal profunda capaz de generar textos basados en lenguaje natural. Esto significa que, dándole instrucciones, el sistema es capaz de redactar relatos coherentes y comprensibles.¿Qué hace diferente a GPT-4?Se espera que GPT-4 sea una versión mejorada y más avanzada del modelo actual. GPT-3 es actualmente uno de los modelos de lenguaje más grandes y potentes del mundo, con 175 mil millones de parámetros y la capacidad de generar textos coherentes y que a veces pueden ser indistinguibles de los escritos por humanos.After more than seven decades of research and development, artificial intelligence is beginning to be present in our daily lives.

This means that, given instructions, the system is able to write coherent and comprehensible narratives.What makes GPT-4 different?GPT-4 is expected to be an improved and more advanced version of the current model.

""It passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers,"" writes OpenAI in its announcement. ""In contrast, GPT-3.5’s score was around the bottom 10%.""OpenAI plans to release GPT-4's text capability through ChatGPT and its commercial API, but with a waitlist at first.

And aked him to do me a favor and give me ten reasons why even the most advanced artificial intelligence in the world believes that god is a creative - not a controller. I think I love that guy/girl.Here is what Chat said.Well, let's see if we can have some fun with this one! Here are 10 reasons why I think God is a creative, not a controller:1.     God gave us free will, which means he's not constantly micromanaging us like a control freak.2.     The world is full of beauty and wonder, which suggests that God has a sense of creativity and whimsy.3.     Have you seen some of the animals God created? Platypuses? Giraffes? Clearly, this is the work of a playful and imaginative Creator.4.     If God was a controller, he probably would have made everything exactly the same, like an assembly line. Or in squares, for easy stacking.5.     God made humans in his image, which means he must have some creative spark in him.6.     The Bible is full of poetry, song, and metaphor, which suggests that God enjoys using creative language to communicate deep within us.7.     When we pray, we often use our own words to talk to God. If he was a controller, he'd probably require us to learn numbers.8.     The changing seasons, the ebb and flow of the tides, and the beauty of a sunset all suggest that God enjoys creating dynamic and drama.9.     The fact that we can find joy in creativity, whether it's painting, writing, or cooking, suggests that this is a part of who God is.10. Finally, if God was a controller, we'd probably all be walking around in blue or grey suits, wearing white shirts – on Fridays without ties.With god as a controller there would be no room for self-expression or individuality. But instead, we have a world full of color, texture, and variety, which suggests he values creativity and self-expression. Halleluja.",1 day ago

It should not replace our speechwriting process, but it can augment the way we prepare.Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are helpful in searching for speech topics, overcoming writer’s block, and finding creative ideas for targeting different audiences.Platforms like Yoodli provide instant feedback on filler words, pacing, and pausing. By integrating ChatGPT, Yoodli offers speech summaries, potential questions to anticipate, and suggestions to make your speech more concise.And this is just the beginning.Who am I learning from in this space?Paul RoetzerofMarketing AI Institutewith their Responsible AI Manifesto for Marketing and Business,Kevin RooseandCasey Newtonon Hard Fork podcast, andPeter H. Diamandison Exponential Wisdom. Finally, my good friend and technologistMatt Strainwho advises companies on generative AI.Beyond the public speaking use case, I see AI completely changing the way businesses tap into and utilize their knowledge. Businesses can train an AI system on their own data in order to synthesize and summarize it, so they can make more informed decisions.For my Harvard class, here’s the guidance I’m planning to offer:- If you choose to use AI tools in this class, I expect you to fully document how you’ve used them and describe it in your post-speech survey. You may not use these tools to generate speech drafts because that can hinder rather than aid your learning in this class. You may not submit AI-generated text as your own.- Remember that generative AI is like a qualitative calculator that is correct only some of the time, especially given potential bias and inaccuracy in the information it contains.- Ultimately, you are responsible for the words that come out of your mouth, both figuratively and literally. I expect any speech you deliver in class to reflect your own stories, anecdotes, beliefs, and opinions.This tipping point in artificial intelligence creates a new technological frontier, and we are all learning as we go.

When shown a photo of a boxing glove hanging over a wooden seesaw with a ball on one side, for instance, a person can ask what will happen if the glove drops, and GPT-4 will respond that it would hit the seesaw and cause the ball to fly up.The buzzy launch capped months of hype and anticipation over an AI program, known as a large language model, that early testers had claimed was remarkably advanced in its ability to reason and learn new things. The developers pledged in a Tuesday blog post that the technology could further revolutionize work and life.But those promises have also fueled anxiety over how people will be able to compete for jobs outsourced to eerily refined machines or trust the accuracy of what they see online. The developers themselves said they were delaying key features for fear of opening new opportunities for abuse.Officials with the San Francisco lab said GPT-4′s “multimodal” training across text and images would allow it to escape the chat box and more fully emulate a world of color and imagery, surpassing ChatGPT in its “advanced reasoning capabilities.” A person could upload an image, and GPT-4 could caption it for them, describing the objects and scene.""#TScottClendaniel#bigdata#businessintelligence#programming#analytics#datamining#data",3 hours ago

Developed by MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, a new deep learning-based AI prediction model that can anticipate the development of breast cancer up to five years in advance is an excellent example of AI for good.This MIT tool, trained on mammograms from the Massachusetts General Hospital, starts from the data and uses deep learning to identify patterns that would not be apparent or even observable by human clinicians.Deep tech and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly evolving in healthcare and can potentially transform how we approach patient care, from diagnosis to treatment.The early adoption of these health techs will transform health infra & save lives!#ai#healthcare#tech",13 hours ago

Två insikter står ut i synnerhet:1)IBMvar rätt ute när dom tidigt föredrog att istället för ""Artificial Intelligence"" valde att prata om ""Augmented Intelligence"". Det är verkligen så att människan är ett teknologiskt djur olikt alla andra djur och de människor som väljer att fördjupa sin relation till teknologin, nyfiket utforskar dess möjligheter och engagerar sig i att begränsa dess risker kommer att gå en ljusare, mer produktiv & kreativ och mänsklig framtid till mötes än dom som väljer att dra täcket över huvudet...2) H.G. Wells hade rätt när han observerade att ""Human history becomes all the more a race between education and catastrophe."" Utbildning är helt avgörande för att lyckas skapa långsiktigt hållbara samhällen. Och hur vi utformar utbildning, hur vi utbildar oss själva och hur vi skapar förutsättningar för att olika människor ska kunna ta till sig utbildning på sina villkor och utifrån sina förutsättningar behöver anpassas utifrån både den samtid vi befinner oss i och den framtid vi avsiktligt eller oavsiktligt som bäst håller på att skapa åt oss själva.PingMats LewanAmer MohammedChristian von EssenMathias SundinChristian LandgrenOch tackAI Think Tankför tröjan!
