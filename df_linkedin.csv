Salomé Lannier,24,2 comments,3 reposts,"Hi network!I am happy to share my first English paper, published by eucrim! A big thanks toAnna Pingenfor her help!In a nutshell: (human trafficking + artificial intelligence) x US = questioning European sovereigntiesDon't hesitate to contact me if you have any feedback on this paper/topic!Here is the full abstract: Human trafficking is keeping pace with new technologies, but so is its repression. Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) systems support the daily work of law enforcement authorities in detecting and investigating trafficking schemes. These systems were developed, and are used primarily, in the United States of America (US). As the fight against human trafficking is a worldwide priority, they are often exported from the US or replicated. Yet, so far, little research has been done to examine how (US) policies and values might be embedded in these specific systems. This article argues that the spread of US tools using artificial intelligence to combat human trafficking hinders the autonomy of foreign States. Particularly in the European context, these tools might challenge national criminal sovereignty as well as Europe’s digital sovereignty. The article highlights the US policies surrounding human trafficking that are embedded in these AI systems (legal definition, political priorities and decisions) and the lack of adequate consideration of existing European standards. These are meant to protect human rights while developing and using AI systems, i‧e. the protection of personal data and control over technical standards.Here is the full paper:https://lnkd.in/ddAjppw6Spoiler alert: another paper should be published soon on the European regulation of this kind of algorithm (although in French this time)!#humantrafficking#ai#sovereignty#legal#research",1 day ago

"Sergio Alvarez-Teleña, PhD",13,1 comment,2 reposts,"I tend not to talk much about AI. I rather use the term ML. But yesterday we had this visit from a couple of interesting people at SciTheWorld - an advisor to the CEO of an IBEX company and the former president of theInter-American Development Bank, Enrique V Iglesias - and I found myself talking about the definition of ""intelligence"".I always say the same: I pretty much accept any definition for intel. It looks to me rather a philosophical discussion so I am not bold enough to enumerate the different dimensions of the concept as a closed-form solution.But that brainstorming made me think of another way to define intelligence. Instead of benchmarking the intel of the machine against that of the human it looks to me that it is easier, at this point, to do it the other way around. Why not? Nevertheless, it is more difficult for me to define the intel of a human than that of a machine.Hence: ""Intelligence is a process that cannot be achieved by machine learning yet. The creativity that figures out the out-of-sample even when it only accounts for small data. The process that discounts the change of the distribution that generates the data with little context. The one that adds orthogonal value in a non-random manner. And one that does it all at the lowest energy consumption"". Pretty much.At our Centre of Excellence we are tackling the out-of-sample (the awarded VR Simulation) and the context (the different dimension-driven approaches that we are publishing and are still researching on).With regards to small data we still need the combination human-machine, Augmented Machines, as in the paper of ""Advances in Portfolio Management: On-Platform Governance for Portfolio Managers"", since we can't figure it out yet. And pretty much the same for the energy consumption - our brain is a massive machine utterly efficient. So... we are very far, at least from this point of view, to call what we have anything near to Artificial Intelligence.Plus, to be fair, no one is really investigating that. We are still focused on ML - which, for the time being, is good enough!",1 day ago

Jorge Gómez,4,,,"Hello everyone,I wanted to share some exciting news about howStripeis usingOpenAI's Chat GPT-4 to improve the user experience and combat fraud.As you may know, Stripe provides financial infrastructure to enable businesses of all sizes to accept payments securely and easily. We are constantly looking for ways to make our platform even better, and we believe that artificial intelligence and machine learning can help us achieve that goal.One area where we are using AI to enhance the user experience is through our Chat GPT-4 integration. This technology allows us to provide personalized and conversational customer support to our users in real-time, making it easier for them to get the help they need when they need it. By using natural language processing, Chat GPT-4 can understand the intent behind a user's question and provide relevant responses, reducing the time and effort required to resolve issues.But Chat GPT-4 is not just improving the user experience - it's also helping us combat fraud. By analyzing vast amounts of data and detecting patterns, our machine learning algorithms can identify potential fraudulent activity and flag it for review. This helps us to protect our users and maintain the integrity of our platform.At Stripe, we are committed to using technology to make online payments safer, easier, and more convenient for everyone. We believe that Chat GPT-4 is a powerful tool that can help us achieve these goals, and we are excited to continue exploring its potential.Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more exciting updates with you in the future!",27 minutes ago

Ignasi Henry Batlle Daniel,1,1 comment,,"Digital transformation is an essential process in the current era of technology and business. Companies that do not adopt digital transformation run the risk of falling behind and losing their competitive advantage. One way to achieve digital transformation is through the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in a company's departments.Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that require human intelligence, such as learning, perception, natural language understanding, and decision-making. In the business realm, AI can be used to automate processes, reduce costs, improve efficiency, and increase accuracy in decision-making.One department in a company where AI can be successfully applied is the human resources department. With the help of AI, human resources departments can automate candidate selection, analyze employee performance, and predict job satisfaction. AI can also be used to improve employee experience by providing quick answers to frequently asked questions and eliminating the need for manual tasks.Another department that can benefit from the application of AI is the marketing department. AI can be used to analyze customer and market data, enabling marketing departments to personalize marketing and advertising strategies, increase ROI, and improve customer retention. AI can also be used to improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns through sentiment analysis, image recognition, and audience segmentation.The finance department can also leverage AI to automate manual tasks, improve accuracy, and reduce the risk of human errors. AI can be used to predict cash flow, analyze expenses, and provide recommendations to optimize financial management. Additionally, AI can be used to detect fraud and prevent financial losses.In conclusion, digital transformation is an essential process for companies seeking to maintain their competitive advantage in the current market. The application of AI in a company's departments can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase accuracy in decision-making. The human resources, marketing, and finance departments are just a few examples of departments that can benefit from AI. Companies that adopt AI can achieve a competitive advantage in the market and improve their long-term profitability.#marketing#inteligenciaartifical#bussines#negocios#technology#data",16 hours ago

Andrei Grebenshchikov,2,,,"From Chatbots to Personalized Recommendations:Let's think about the role of AI tools in UXI find it amazing how open artificial intelligence (AI)#aiplatforms are changing the field of user experience (UX)#uxdesign. One significant area where open AI is making a difference is in the development of chatbots. These are automated messaging tools that can simulate human conversations, and they are becoming increasingly popular in customer service and marketing.With open AI platforms like TensorFlowhttps://lnkd.in/dVXeg3pdand PyTorchhttps://pytorch.org/, creating chatbots that can understand natural language and provide accurate responses is now easier than ever.This is making it possible for businesses to provide better customer service, boost engagement, and increase sales. Chatbots can even reduce costs by freeing up human agents to handle more complex tasks.Another area where open AI is impacting UX is in the development of personalized recommendations. With the vast amount of content available online, it can be challenging for users to find what they need. Personalized recommendations use machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and provide tailored suggestions based on their interests and preferences.Open AI platforms like Apache Mahouthttps://mahout.apache.org/andH2O.aihttps://h2o.ai/make it simple to develop personalized recommendation engines. This is helping businesses provide users with more relevant content, improving their experience, and increasing engagement.As a product designer, I'm excited about the potential of open AI to improve the products we create.

While this handbook will build on existing work, it stresses the reconceptualization of digital labor in various contexts, connecting them across the sectors and generations, and is intended to contribute to structural analysis and intellectual praxis toward emancipatory movements.This handbook is organized around four themes that are defined historically, technologically, and internationally in the realms of work and control, solidarity politics, pedagogy, and imaginaries:1. Labor Under Capitalism2. Digital Technologies, Work and Control3. Solidarity Politics and the Working-Class Majority4. Pedagogy, Imaginary and EmancipationIn this project, we investigate foundational labor questions as well as emerging and/or persistent patterns of labor and labor organization under new conditions such as digital platforms, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), the ”gig” economy, new divisions of labor, and alternative developments.If you are interested, please email a 200-word abstract to us by April 15, 2023. You may choose to submit your chapter to any of the four themes above, or we can make a decision after reading your abstract. You will be informed about the review and selection result by May 15, 2023. If selected, you will need to submit the full chapter, consisting of 6,000 - 8,000 words by August 15, 2023.Do not hesitate to contact us atjack.qiu@ntu.edu.sgWe look forward to learning about your work on digital labor issues.

Despite these efforts, the organization cautioned that the model may still be susceptible to disseminating misinformation.* Initially, GPT-4 will be offered to subscribers of ChatGPT Plus, who will receive premium access to the service.* GPT-4 has more advanced reasoning capabilities than ChatGPT, being able to offer features such as finding possible meeting times for three separate schedules with ease.* OpenAI has announced partnerships with Duolingo and Be My Eyes to develop AI-powered chatbots that can assist users in natural language. These chatbots will be designed to support language learners and visually impaired individuals.Despite improvements, OpenAI has cautioned that GPT-4 may still be prone to errors such as ""hallucinating"" - where the AI generates false information or erroneous reasoning.#gpt4#technology#innovation#business#generativeAI#ai#gpt#chatgpt#GetStartedAU",10 hours ago

Greenwald, and many other experts and leaders in our space.Commissioner Goldsmith Romero said, “With our markets facing some of the most challenging and innovative times for next-generation technology, I am honored that the new members of the Technology Advisory Committee have agreed to this public service. To protect our markets from increasingly-sophisticated cyber attacks, to ensure responsible development of digital assets in a way that protects customers, and to ensure that the implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence are well understood, the Commission requires advice from technology experts. These experts can provide us foundational knowledge about the technology, as well as the complex and nuanced impacts and implications of technology on financial markets. That’s why I’ve reimagined TAC membership to bring together well-respected and well-known leaders, thinkers, builders, and doers from the technology industry, federal leaders, academia, and public interest representatives. I am especially honored to have Carole House serve as Chair, and Ari Redbord as Vice Chair—both highly regarded for their exceptional federal service and expertise in complex technological issues.”As we all work together to build a safer financial system, it is so important to bring together expertise and perspectives from both the public and private sectors.

It will blow#ChatGPTout of the water.The long-awaited tool, which can describe images in words, marks a huge leap forward for AI power — and another major shift for ethical norms""HOT OFF THE PRESSES!From the article:""The artificial intelligence research lab OpenAI on Tuesday launched the newest version of its stunning language software, GPT-4, an advanced tool for analyzing images and mimicking human speech, pushing the technical and ethical boundaries of a rapidly proliferating wave of#AI.OpenAI’s earlier product, ChatGPT, captivated and unsettled the public with its uncanny ability to generate elegant writing, unleashing a viral wave of college essays, screenplays and conversations — though it could only generate text, and it relied on an older generation of technology that hasn’t been cutting-edge for more than a year.GPT-4, in contrast, is a state-of-the-art system capable of creating not just words but describing images in response to a person’s simple written commands. When shown a photo of a boxing glove hanging over a wooden seesaw with a ball on one side, for instance, a person can ask what will happen if the glove drops, and GPT-4 will respond that it would hit the seesaw and cause the ball to fly up.The buzzy launch capped months of hype and anticipation over an AI program, known as a large language model, that early testers had claimed was remarkably advanced in its ability to reason and learn new things. The developers pledged in a Tuesday blog post that the technology could further revolutionize work and life.But those promises have also fueled anxiety over how people will be able to compete for jobs outsourced to eerily refined machines or trust the accuracy of what they see online. The developers themselves said they were delaying key features for fear of opening new opportunities for abuse.Officials with the San Francisco lab said GPT-4′s “multimodal” training across text and images would allow it to escape the chat box and more fully emulate a world of color and imagery, surpassing ChatGPT in its “advanced reasoning capabilities.” A person could upload an image, and GPT-4 could caption it for them, describing the objects and scene.""#TScottClendaniel#bigdata#businessintelligence#programming#analytics#datamining#data",14 hours ago

Allison Shapira,47,40 comments,3 reposts,"You have a speech coming up; should you use an AI tool like ChatGPT to write it?I’m preparing to answer that question for my graduate students atHarvard Kennedy Schoolin our class, The Arts of Communication.For several years, I’ve studied the implications of artificial intelligence in the field of public speaking.This includes advising AI speech coach companies likeYoodli(Global Public Speaking LLCpartnered with Yoodli to create our own bespoke platform AMPLIFY) and beta-testing half a dozen other platforms and apps.AttendingMIT Technology Review’s Em Tech Digital AI Conference last year provided a deeper understanding of the benefits, risks, and process involved in integrating an AI system into my business.I believe artificial intelligence can be used effectively in a “driver-assist” as opposed to a “driverless” function. It should not replace our speechwriting process, but it can augment the way we prepare.Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are helpful in searching for speech topics, overcoming writer’s block, and finding creative ideas for targeting different audiences.Platforms like Yoodli provide instant feedback on filler words, pacing, and pausing. By integrating ChatGPT, Yoodli offers speech summaries, potential questions to anticipate, and suggestions to make your speech more concise.And this is just the beginning.Who am I learning from in this space?Paul RoetzerofMarketing AI Institutewith their Responsible AI Manifesto for Marketing and Business,Kevin RooseandCasey Newtonon Hard Fork podcast, andPeter H. Diamandison Exponential Wisdom. Finally, my good friend and technologistMatt Strainwho advises companies on generative AI.Beyond the public speaking use case, I see AI completely changing the way businesses tap into and utilize their knowledge. Businesses can train an AI system on their own data in order to synthesize and summarize it, so they can make more informed decisions.For my Harvard class, here’s the guidance I’m planning to offer:- If you choose to use AI tools in this class, I expect you to fully document how you’ve used them and describe it in your post-speech survey. You may not use these tools to generate speech drafts because that can hinder rather than aid your learning in this class.

💥 Shreyas Chiplunkar 💥,113,17 comments,,"A quick Case Study onApollo.io.Introduction:Apollo.iois a sales acceleration platform that provides sales teams with comprehensive data and tools to help them find and engage with potential customers more effectively. The company was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. This case study will examine the growth and success ofApollo.io, as well as its impact on the sales industry.Background:Prior to the launch ofApollo.io, the sales industry relied heavily on outdated and inefficient methods for generating leads and engaging with potential customers. These methods included cold calling, email blasts, and purchasing lists of contact information. These approaches often resulted in low conversion rates and frustrated sales teams.Solution:Apollo.iorecognized this problem and set out to create a comprehensive sales acceleration platform that could help sales teams find and engage with potential customers more effectively. The platform leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide users with accurate and up-to-date contact information for potential customers. Additionally,Apollo.iooffers a suite of tools for automating outreach, tracking engagement, and analyzing performance.Results:Since its launch,Apollo.io.io has experienced significant growth and success. The company has raised over $45 million in funding and has acquired several smaller companies to expand its capabilities. In 2020,Apollo.io.io was named to the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing companies in America, with a three-year growth rate of 1,303%. The platform is used by over 7,000 companies, including major brands like Hubspot, Marketo, and Zenefits.Impact:The success ofApollo.io.io has had a significant impact on the sales industry. The platform has helped sales teams improve their efficiency and effectiveness, resulting in higher conversion rates and increased revenue. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has paved the way for more advanced and effective sales tools, which are likely to become increasingly common in the future.Conclusion:Apollo.io.io is a prime example of how technology can be used to revolutionize an industry. By providing sales teams with accurate data and powerful tools, the platform has helped to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of sales efforts. As the sales industry continues to evolve, it is likely that more companies will turn to similar technologies to help them stay ahead of the curve.#technology#sales#future#growth",6 hours ago
Dan Lewkowicz,40,73 comments,1 repost,"ChatGPT AICould Find a Place in Commercial Real Estate. In Some Ways, It Already HasProfessionals Begin To Embrace Nascent#AIin Industry Traditionally Slow To Adopt TechnologyWhenBarbi Reuter, CEO and principal ofCushman & Wakefield|PICOR Commercial Real Estate Servicesin Tucson, Arizona, went to write an opening statement for an annual awards ceremony, she decided to open up the artificial intelligence chatbotChatGPT AIto perfect her tone.“I prompted, ‘Write a compelling opening for the CEO at the 37th annual awards luncheon,’” Reuter told CoStar News. “I opened our banquet with it and then fessed up on the source. The team was pretty incredulous!”SinceOpenAI’s chatbot launched in November, real estate professionals across the country have experimented with it to help with tasks ranging from copy editing to tweaking the tone of an email to a disgruntled client. But while#executivesand#brokersare still exploring AI’s many uses — ChatGPT still has bugs and accuracy issues it’s working out — there’s agreement it holds the potential to make some industry tasks easier.Right now, AI’s biggest benefit is efficiency, according to commercial real estate professionals who joined in on aTwitterconversation aboutChatGPT AI. Users said they asked it to do once-overs for grammar and tone in marketing materials, property descriptions, letters of intent and right of first refusal contracts, to name a few examples.The technology can also help with lease reviews, comparing information against an agreed-upon letter of intent and avoiding bias in favor of the landlord or tenant, users said. Beyond that, it has basic coding capabilities and can perform data analysis to identify market patterns and risks.Some industry professionals are projecting more significant capabilities in the future.“In its current state, I think of it as a tool to assist in improving daily efficiency, but in the long term, I think AI will be transformative to the industry by eliminating repetitive and low-barrier-to-entry jobs,”Bronwyn Scrivens, SIOR, an associate broker at Omada Commercial in Edmonton, Alberta, wrote in an email toCoStar GroupNews.Possible Listings EffectAI has the potential to reshape the#brokerageand#RealEstatelisting service sectors the most, according toKunal Lunawat, co-founder and managing partner ofAgya Ventures, a San Francisco-based real estate technology fund.ChatGPT AIisn’t yet able to access real-time real estate data, but other AI technology has the potential to significantly improve real estate listing searches. For example, it could narrow down a search based on a client’s preferences to about 90% accuracy, and then brokers could help pick through the remaining 10%, Lunawat said.Special thanks toCoStar Groupfor this valuable information.What are YOUR thoughts about AI's place in our field?#10DayCRE",1 day ago

""Well, AI can mimic us, but it can't really do poetry."" ""ChatGPT can do essays, but it isn't wise."" ""Oh no, the livelihoods of artists and animators are threatened by the emergence of AI.""At some level, the panic is justified: deepfakes, quasi-sentient bots, and artistic algorithms effectively trouble 'our' vaunted place in the scheme of things. It's difficult to know what to do here, to know what to do with artificiality.  Perhaps one thing to do is to trouble the assumption of distance between the artificial and the natural.Maybe nature is unnatural. Maybe nature is artificial. Maybe artifice has a hidden life, the kind that the legendary animators of the Toy Story series transcribed to our delight...the kind theologians of panentheistic persuasions wax poetic about.

Arjun Venkatraman,54,12 comments,5 reposts,"Came to donate blood for a friend atAIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi)this morning. Shocked at the pathetic state of processes and the  rudeness of doctors and staff.From the guard at the queue, to the lady at the reception, to the attending doctor (whose name I'm sorely tempted to share) not a single person has the decency to manage their tone or speak politely to the people lined up to donate blood.Some phrases being shouted about -""हमें किसी के ब्लड की जरूरत नहीं है, अपने मरीज के लिए देने आए हो, तमीज से बैठना है तो बैठो नहीं तो जाओ, हमे कोई फ़र्क नहीं पड़ता"" (We don't need anyone's blood, you're here to give blood for your patient, give if you want to or leave, we don't care)""बैठ जाओ ना, चेयर में क्या कांटे लगे हैं?"" (Sit down! Are their thorns on the chair?)अपना नाम लिखना नहीं आता? कहां कहां से आ जाते हैं, जाओ यहां से। (If you don't know how to write your name, get lost)Not unexpectedly, the worst treatment was reserved for those who looked most incapable of pushing back or seeking recourse. Speaking in English and implying an education resulted in a slightly better tone. Clearly the colonial mindset remains ingrained.Apart from the fundamental disregard for human dignity, the processes were also pretty broken1. Paper based forms, and pictures of Aadhaar accepted over WhatsApp - no OTP based biometric authorisation.2. Haemoglobin and pulse noted without actually taking any readings.3. An ad hoc counseling model, different for each individual carried out with no privacy despite deeply personal questions about sexual behaviour and medical history. Many probing and irrelevant questions about profession and education. (The same screaming doctor was asking one person ""How many types of History are there?"", because the person happened to mention he was an arts student.4. General lack of hygeine - while the blood donation equipment was clearly world class, the sheets on the chairs were stained and clearly hadn't been changed in a while.While I have often questioned the ethics of automation in medicine, after this experience, I stand corrected. In an age when even a toothbrush can be delivered in 10 minutes, a three hour harrowing procedure to donate a life giving substance is apalling.I now look forward to the day when instead of dealing with uncouth human beings with delusions of superiority and a fundamental lack of compassion, I can actually deal with a well programmed and polite artificial intelligence!",1 day ago

Rajiv Gupta,66,8 comments,,"DO AUDITORS (or CAs) NEED TO UPSKILL?Here are some main reasons why we auditors (and CAs) need to upskill:1. Stay competitive: The audit industry is becoming increasingly competitive. To stand out from the crowd, we auditors need to constantly improve their skills and knowledge.2. Provide better value to clients or employers: By upskilling, auditors can offer better services to their clients or employers. We can provide more in-depth advice, better analysis, and innovative solutions to complex problems.3. Adopt emerging technologies: The audit industry is embracing new technologies such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation. We auditors need to upskill to use these technologies effectively and efficiently.So,…to conclude, i believe upskilling is required for auditors, as well, to remain competitive, relevant and provide better services to the clients or employers.#audit#artificialintelligence#automation#dataanalytics",11 hours ago

Davy Halliday,53,18 comments,,"After more than a year of development and three months of beta with early clients, I am excited to officially announce the launch of Evalio in the French market! Combining cutting edge technology and human expertise, we have developed a modern and innovative approach to real estate valuation to provide appraisals that are faster, more accurate and more cost effective than previously possible.As real estate credit investors, my co-founderAnthony Casagrandeand I faced the age-old problem shared by banks, insurance companies, and investors: how to accurately and efficiently determine the value of a flow of properties. In a market where small discrepancies in valuation can have disastrous consequences, financial institutions are faced with a polar trade-off between cost and risk.Heavily regulated and of high quality, accredited expert appraisals are the gold standard of valuation. However, this expertise comes at a cost and may take weeks to produce. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) valuations are cost-effective and lightning-fast but are opaque and not nearly consistent enough to be relied upon by professional actors.At Evalio we have developed a hybrid solution, combining the quality and precision of expert appraisals with the speed and efficiency of AI. We call this Augmented Expertise! In a nutshell:🎯  Interpretable AI. Working with some of the best minds in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we have developed a market leading valuation AI. Designed for interpretability, its high quality and justified valuations can be understood and adjusted by qualified human experts.💥 Curated Big Data. We’ve aggregated 40+ big data sources to the comprehensive set of 49 million buildings in France. This provides our experts the exhaustive and up-to-date information they need to carry out quality appraisals.💡 Process Automation. The expert’s manual and inefficient tasks are automated and streamlined, enabling them to focus on what they do best: analysing the unique features of each property and providing valuable insights.📑 Comprehensive and Dynamic Reports. From their analysis our expert can generate a comprehensive appraisal report in seconds, not weeks.🚀 Unified SaaS Platform. All of this from a single user-friendly platform.The result? Comprehensive appraisals delivered in record time that you can rely on, consistently.Go toevalio.ioto request a demo and understand how Evalio can help you.📣 Tomorrow we will release an article that explains the origins of our project and provides more details on the technology underlying it.

Mani Padisetti,31,21 comments,5 reposts,"The Rise of AI-Powered Scams: Don't Fall Victim to the Latest Tech ThreatIt's disheartening to think about the scams that people are willing to perpetrate in the name of Artificial Intelligence. Here are some recent examples:1. Phishing scams that use AI-generated text to trick people into giving up sensitive information or clicking on harmful links.One example of a phishing scam that uses AI-generated text is the ""CEO fraud"" scam, where scammers use AI to create convincing emails that appear to come from high-level executives in a company.2. Fraudulent investment schemes that use AI buzzwords and false claims to lure people into investing in non-existent or worthless projects.An example is the ""blockchain investment"" scam, where scammers use AI-generated content to promote a new cryptocurrency or blockchain project.They make bold claims about how this new technology will revolutionize the world, but in reality, the project doesn't exist or has no value.3. Fake customer service chatbots that trick people into giving up personal information or making unauthorised purchases.Scammers create a chatbot that looks and sounds like a real customer service representative, but it's really just a computer program designed to trick people.The chatbot might offer to help with a problem or issue, but then it will ask for personal information like your name, address, and credit card details.4. ""Deepfake"" videos and images that use AI technology to create convincing but entirely fake footage of real people, which can be used for all sorts of nefarious purposes.Want to manipulate the public's opinion by showing a politician doing something scandalous? Piece of cake.With AI, you can create convincing but entirely fake footage of real people.5. Job scams that use AI-generated job postings and fake interview processes to trick job seekers into paying for nonexistent job placements or training programs.And if you apply, they'll even put you through a fake interview process, just to make it seem more convincing.But of course, there's a catch. They'll tell you that you need to pay for some kind of training program or job placement service before they can offer you the job.And once you pay, they'll disappear into the ether.6. Malware that uses AI to evade detection by antivirus software, making it more difficult to protect computer systems from attacks.In 2020, a group of hackers known as APT29 used AI-generated emails and malicious attachments to launch a cyberattack on a pharmaceutical company involved in COVID-19 vaccine research.The malware used AI techniques to evade detection by antivirus software.The malware was able to evade detection by using AI to mimic legitimate traffic patterns and blend in with normal network traffic.Educating our computer users at work and at home is the key to avoid becoming victims.",12 hours ago

Customers upload a picture to the retailer’s online store and a virtual stylist analyzes the photo. It recommends the best colors for the person’s skin tones and gets specific .🔹AI is widely used for inspiration and idea generation.As part of every designer’s process, the early phase involves a lot of explorations and ideation sessions” ranging from bouncing around blue-sky ideas to brainstorming with colleagues. AI, aids collaboration by expanding person-to-person collaboration to human-to-machine collaboration. “As crazy and interesting as AI is, it’s probably just in its infancy, and designer can only see it getting better and doing much more than outputting images🔹AI for merchandising your products.AI-driven AR and VR help online shoppers more fully comprehend what a garment looks like, and how it will look on them. Certain apps enable customers to project garments onto their actual bodies, then play with color, texture and accessories to get a look that’s just right,🔹AI is utilised to make the Fashion industry “GREEN”AI can help on several fronts, starting with trends forecasting. Deciding what customers want, then mass producing that item, is a game of chance: Bet wrong, and a manufacturer will end up with a lot of unsold clothing. Several firms use AI and machine learning to analyze images on social media, taking note of prints, shapes and color to help their manufacturer clients figure out what’s going to sail and what’s going to sink. These companies also use AI to help brands figure out pricing strategies and steer clear of trends that are on their way out.🔹AI will reduce the counterfeiting.A tool created by accounting giant Deloitte, uses AI to spot design infringements. The tool, Dupe Killer, uses information from millions of photographs to detect subtle but distinct design elements, for instance the shape of an item, a color or even stitching pattern unique to the object.Another solution uses computer vision, a field of AI, to authenticate “real” items and thus help customs officials and others along the supply chain spot fakes.🔹AI-powered wearable devices becoming fashion trends.The designer, predicts this use extending to apparel. Implemented into garments, AI could result in smarter fabrics, clothes better for sports and performance, and clothes more reactive to the body, materials out there can sense when the body is hot or sweating, and small pores inside the material open up to allow for more airflow.#ai#aiforbusiness",7 hours ago

Sriparna Saha,73,5 comments,,"Our article titled ""Graph-BERT and Language Model-based Frameworkfor Protein-Protein Interaction Identification"" got accepted in Nature Scientific Reports (IF: 4.996; h5-index: 206).Authors:Kanchan Jha,Sourav Karmakar,Sriparna SahaIdentification of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is among the critical problems in the domain of bioinformatics. Previous studies have utilized different AI-based models for PPI classification with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The input to these models is the features extracted from different sources of protein information, mainly sequence-derived features. In this work, we present an AI-based PPI identification model utilizing a PPI network and protein sequences. The PPI network is represented as a graph where each node is a protein pair, and an edge is defined between two nodes if there exists a common protein between these nodes. Each node in a graph has a feature vector. In this work, we have used the language model to extract feature vectors directly from protein sequences. The feature vectors for protein in pairs are concatenated and used as a node feature vector of a PPI network graph. Finally, we have used the Graph-BERT model to encode the PPI network graph with sequence-based features and learn the hidden representation of the feature vector for each node. Thenext step involves feeding the learned representations of nodes to the fully connected layer, the output of which is fed into the softmax layer to classify the protein interactions. To assess the efficacy of the proposed PPI model, we have performed experiments on several PPI datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses the existing PPI works and designed baselines in classifying PPI.Heartiest congratulations to all authors!",15 hours ago

Francesco Maranelli, Anna Ghiraldini, Christian Toson, Marco Pogacnik, Marzia Marandola, and his colleagues from the Faculty of Architecture of the IUAVUniversità Iuav di Veneziaare now organizing a symposium on the occasion of this little book 📕.The basic storyline goes like this…In the 1960s, the era of cybernetics, architects and designers encountered entirely new ways of operating technical systems: buildings could be calculated using circuit diagrams, while creativity and imagination were confronted with the technical intelligence of thinking machines. Architects and designers found themselves in the crosshairs of a new digital unrest: at stake was nothing less than the authority of inventive human intelligence in a techno-scientific world. Today, almost seven decades later, we can witness computing machines, once so heavy, losing weight while gaining power. Smart sensors are colonizing the bodies and buildings, creating their own digital ecosystems and giving rise to forms of (open) society and ways of being that cannot be explained without data -THE NEW OPEN.

The majority of rheumatic diseases are also chronic, and benefit from datasets where patients are followed longitudinally[1].""#My2_centsDespite#machinelearning(#ML) is an emerging research hotspot[2] to date AI / ML models often fail the tests of clinical reality. This may have to do with blind spots in training data. EHRs contain data, including unscheduled visits during a flare or hospitalizations, and can fill in data gaps not available from RCT and observational cohort studies.“A challenge for prospective patient collections is to capture patients at the right moment, particularly early in the disease… RWD-EHR allows us to look back at previously collected data[1].“Autoimmunity demonstrates the challenges and can be the domain to develop working blueprints for other medical fields and applications.“Although an automated phenotyping algorithm has potential for diagnosing patients with certain subtypes of rheumatoid arthritis using EHR data, design choices and missing data currently limit its clinical utility[3-6].”Nevertheless, a veritable cornucopia of impressive examples of data classes,#laboratoryvalues and AI comes with (the not yet peer-reviewed) “Understanding the role and adoption of artificial intelligence techniques in#rheumatologyresearch: an in-depth review of the literature[7].”What will be the future of longitudinal RWD and#PrecisionMedicine?

Shahbaz Khan,27,6 comments,,"#artificialintelligenceand#automationAs the Technology is evolving and market is growing for IOTs and AI (Artificial Intelligence) based solutions in Purchasing, sells, data management & decision making etc., many vendors claim they are providing AI based solutions but in reality it's just automation. Word 'AI' sales better and due to limited understanding of 'AI' people /Clients often gets confused between the two.Artificial intelligence (AI) involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. AI can process large amounts of data in ways that humans cannot. The goal for AI is to be able to do things like recognize patterns, make decisions, and judge like humans.Automation can use AI; however, the majority of automation utilises traditional software to move data from one place to another. The difference between AI and automation is that AI aims to simulate human thinking. Put another way; automation works with data — AI 'understands' data like humans and then take decisions.AI uses machine learning either supervised or unsupervised and has become a very good tool for analytic decision making and obviously require huge amount of past data to draw pattern and take decisions however for intuitive decision making human intervention still required and a considerable amount of development still needed before AI can assist in intuitive decision making.For example - Airlines and many site which sales tickets have been using 'AI' to recommend alternate routes in case of delayed or missed flights to their customers based on assessment of massive amount of historical data and through analytic decision making process however in pandemic times, which was never seen by Aviation industry since no data was available 'AI' could not proposes solution of alternate routes and flights and human intervention was must because human have the capabilities to use their intuition and suggest solutions to customer /Clinets.#facilitiesmanagement#operationsmanagement#technology#leadership#artificialintelligencetechnology",1 day ago

Shafqat Sayeed,58,4 comments,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making strides in various industries and has the potential to automate most writing tasks by using algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) to generate written content. While AI writing is still in its early stages and far from perfect, it's clear that it poses a threat to the livelihood of professional writers.However, putting thoughts to paper is an activity that calls for imagination, sympathy, and knowledge of the inner workings of the human mind. It's not just about making sure your words are grammatically sound; you need to be able to tell a story that sticks with the reader and evokes the right feeling or reaction. It’s still a long road for technology to possess the subtlety and depth of understanding that we have.Writing allows for expression and the sharing of unique perspectives that cannot be replicated by AI. This means that employment in journalism, artistic writing, and technical writing is safe from complete automation.Although AI systems can be helpful to writers, they cannot replace the human element and originality that good writing demands. It may one day make some forms of writing more efficient through automation, but it is not expected to eliminate the need for human writers anytime soon.#automation#AI#artificialintelligence#writers#creativewriting#contentwriting#technology",21 hours ago

Ben Kunz,27,32 comments,2 reposts,"If you want to thrive in the AI future, you need to become a Prompter.This ""Prompter"" concept, of humans skilled in interacting with artificial intelligence (AI) systems, comes from a SXSW speech yesterday by Kevin Kelly. Kelly, if you don't know him, is the wisest sage of technology, one of the earliest users of the Internet and co-founder of Wired magazine. He tracks trends with skepticism, keeps tech personally at arm's length, and yet has the rare ability to cut through Gartner Hype Cycle baloney to explain the real patterns of technological evolution.Yesterday on stage in Austin, Kelly asserted that today's generative AI mania is more than a fad — it's a tipping point in how humans will use tools. Unlike other tech trends that flare up like fireflies and then fade away, today's AI is more like the transition of the Internet from the code-heavy early 1980s to the invention of HMTL, when suddenly everyone and their grandmother could build web pages. ChatGPT didn't really create a new AI system — similar large language model platforms have been around for a decade. But it made the system really, really easy to use.This is no firefly-tech trend, Kelly says. In the past 2 months, 100 million people have suddenly started using AI to write essays, build business plans, make paintings -- the fastest adoption of any new technology in human history. The interface was the breakthrough, and soon every employee will use AI as commonly as Google search for answers or creations.So what does this mean for jobs? Instead of fighting the use of AI as if it were some form of plagiarism, Kelly suggests educators and businesses need to rapidly *train* people on how to interact *more* with it. The most important job of the future will be what Kelly calls ""Prompters"" — people highly skilled in how to query an AI system, with nuance and mutual exploration, to get just the right answers or outputs.AI basically revamps the old computer adage ""garbage in, garbage out"" to a new rule: ""mediocre prompt, mediocre answer."" Anyone can ask ChatGPT a simple question — ""how do I build a business using AI?"" — and it will respond with the average of all the books and webpages and Reddit links it has digested for a moderately OK answer. But if you challenge ChatGPT with nuance — ""Write a business plan for a new company that helps other companies interact with an AI system using the business rules for growth defined by Peter Thiel in his book 'Zero to One'; include a 24-month plan for sequenced investment; and identify major risks with rollout"" — you'll get output that dazzles you.To stretch these rapidly growing AI tools to their potential, we're going to have to learn how to speak with them.P.S. Here's a wonderful example below: My friendChristopher Smithhas been experimenting with virtual model shoots using AI and Photoshop. The woman below doesn't exist.

Chris Rath,52,14 comments,1 repost,"ETA: the Meta announcement today, stating that 10,000 more workers will be cut. It is expected that Talent Acquisition will again be disproportionately affected.https://lnkd.in/gAN4SiTV=========The news today says another few thousand Talent Acquisition candidates will join the pool as Meta announces more layoffs. Eight years into my last career change into recruiting, I find myself considering another shift out of recruiting.I love recruiting, especially strategic sourcing, specialist hiring, pipeline building and crafting target engagement plans. But I got spoiled by my time working in Artificial Intelligence. At Meta, I got to work with the smartest kindest people I have ever met in the tech industry. I got to work on really hard problems. I got to grow as an IC and as a manager.I have applied for a good number of jobs and I have had some great conversations with some start-ups, but I just started my search this month. My applications numbers are nowhere near the numbers of those of my colleagues who have been looking since late 2022, and I will be honest, I'm not sure I want them get there.The market is so crowded right now that I am unlikely to find a job that is as niche and challenging as managing 8 stellar sourcers in discovering the best AI talent in PhD programs. And though I might need it, I don't want a role that is ""just a job.""  With all this throwing of spaghetti at walls that we in the Tech Talent Acquisition world are doing right now, how likely are we to have the ability to be choosy with what we take?(**For any potential employers reading this, I hope I eat my words and we connect for something that is a great fit for both of us 😁 **)So, TA professionals, let's start a conversation:- what are some of your transferrable skills?- what are some roles you have had in the past that you would consider again?- if you have transitioned out of your original role in TA, what are you doing now?- for those of you who landed somewhere did you take a slightly different role? Or maybe you aren't in TA anymore?I hope we all find the Goldilocks of roles, but just in case, I want to remind you all that a lot of different skills go into working as a talent acquisition professional--stay strong!#talentacquisition#layoffs2023#careershift#transferableskillsI'll go first (in the comments):",16 hours ago

ParametricArchitecture,191,1 comment,12 reposts,"AI can perform many different services useful to an architect. The generative design allows for variations on a model to be composed and tested, and design alternatives to be presented for consideration. So, will artificial intelligence ever replace architects? Share your thought in the comments below!The possibility of artificial intelligence replacing creative jobs – as such, architects might be counted – remains vastly uncertain. Opinions claiming that AI can fully replace architects are similarly present as opinions claiming the exact opposite. A main variable, at the moment, remains to what extent AI will progress and develop: Currently, not all common architectural tasks can be replaced. However, fast forward, it is not impossible to imagine that AI, as this technology becomes more diverse, widespread, and advanced, can fully replace the architectural profession.When this point comes, there comes a question alongside it: Are we willing to replace it?

Urusa Nawaz,59,4 comments,,"I recently had the honor of speaking at the International Women's Day event, which was hosted by the United Nations Association in partnership with the City of Houston, Houston Community College, The Alliance, and The Links Inc. This year's theme was ""DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality.""As someone who has worked in the Retail Energy business for 22 years focused on technology and customer experience, I have seen more and more women join these fields over the years. We still have a long way to go toward gender equality. However, it’s exciting to see how the transformation in technology has and continues to open up new opportunities for women with diverse skill sets.Initially, technology was used for “Efficiency”. We built systems to run the business. Women were drawn to the field based on their aptitude for problem-solving and technical skills. This was a very male dominant industry and had a high barrier to entry and advancements.With innovation came Smart Meters, which provided more real-time insights into customer usage. Then the rise of digital channels changed the way customers interacted with us. Thus, technology shifted from being used for efficiency to building customer-focused solutions. This created a gap that was filled with women entering the field who had strong communication and empathy skills. These women were able to bridge the gap between the technical aspects of technology and the needs of customers. I lead the Digital group for Direct Energy brand at NRG and am proud to share that today my group is made up 56% women. They are the driving force behind creating customer led Digital experiences.We are now in a new era of renewable energy technology such as wind and solar power, where advancements in energy storage technology make it possible to store renewable energy and use it when needed. Artificial intelligence is being used to analyze energy usage data and provide insights. This shift has led to technology being used for solving global issues, or ""tech for good”. We are seeing women are drawn to the technology field because they see the potential for using technology to make a positive impact on the world. These women bring a unique perspective to the field and can apply their technical skills to create innovative solutions to social problems.I have a 15-year-old daughter who has been coding since the age of 9 and aspires to be a data scientist. However, her interest is not purely based on her love for technology but also driven by her passion for sustainability and making a difference in the world.We are living in exciting times where the evolution of technology has opened up and will continue to open new opportunities for women with a diverse range of skills and interests to enter the field.",15 hours ago

But, as women and ladies, we need to find out what makes us nervous, have strategies to befriend our nerves and be confident when speaking in public. She also urged as to practice public speaking at least once a month to help improve our public speaking skills- Women and ladies present were  encouraged to support thier fellow women in tech  because we found out we were lacking in that.-During the breakout session, I joined  the group that spoke on ""Bias in AI"" byCharisma B.You will be surprised to know that, a lot of Artificial Intelligence goes into loan decisions, Job opportunities and recruiting processes; which most people are not aware of. Machine learning processes are used to shortlist candidates before the manual selection process. Selection are based on some factors which include, Ethnicity,Gender, Foreigness, spellings etc. and female candidates were more likely to experience discrimination than male candidates.  I urge you to read more about it. However, we came up with suggestions and solutions to reduce these existing bias for transparency, fairness and accountability.Let's all embrace, celebrate, and encourage women to keep rising.Dare to bold, resilient and independent, woman.A'int these pictures beautiful 🥰.

Nevertheless, these things are for real and bound to disrupt human life as we know it. But does that mean we will all be out of work? there will be mass unemployment on a global scale? Well Absolutely Not.Let us for a moment imagine, these technologies are optimized and implemented across all fields and we are all out of work. So, now what? You have self-driving cars but not enough passengers, as they are out of job. There are fully automated industries, mass producing products but again for whom? Their buyers are unemployed. The economics simply won't work.Within a span of last 150 years, we have witnessed the Mechanical Industrial Revolution, Technical/Electrical Industrial Revolution and then the Digital Revolution. Yet workforce by and large has persevered and it will continue to do so, whether by push or pull but it will. An equilibrium has to be reached.

No caso, como lidamos com as máquinas.💻É DIFERENTE DA INOVAÇÃO INCREMENTAL que implementa melhorias em processos ou soluções que já existem.Coincidência ou não, muitas empresas correram para oferecer soluções similares ou anunciar que em breve irão lançar soluções parentes do ChatGPT, ou seja, assistentes de escrita que funcionam a partir de comandos, também chamados de “prompts”.Seguem algumas ferramentas de IA (Inteligência Artificial) ou AI (Artificial Intelligence) que funcionam como assistentes de pesquisa e escrita:1. Canva Magic Write (Escrita Mágica) — é um gerador de texto por IA que ajuda a dar e/ou desenvolver ideias de conteúdo para posts, blogs, gerar listas, entre outros, em vários idiomas.2. Notion IA — é um aliado na escrita e composição de ideias. Não escreve apenas para blogs, mas produz resumos, lista de tarefas, pode funcionar como tradutor, editor de textos etc.Por enquanto está disponível em inglês, coreano e japonês e na versão beta (de teste) para alemão e francês.3. Bard — IA geradora de textos do Google que irá integrar as buscas, tornando as pesquisas mais precisas e mais ágeis. A principal diferença em relação ao ChatGPT é que o Bard usará informações em tempo real para dar as respostas. (Será lançado em breve)O ChatGPT foi alimentado com uma quantidade absurdamente gigante de dados coletados somente até 2021.4. LLaMA — é um modelo de IA da Meta aberto somente para profissionais que atuam em universidades e instituições de pesquisa e seu principal objetivo é ajudar essas pessoas em seus estudos sobre aplicações de inteligência artificial.Por exemplo, como a invenção de informações e vieses ou padrões de pensamento inconscientes que levam a discriminações, preconceitos, entre outros.A ferramenta foi treinada com textos de 20 idiomas mais falados no mundo e já está aceitando inscrições de pesquisadores interessados.5. Novo BING chat — a Microsoft lançou nova versão do seu buscador integrado a um modelo semelhante ao ChatGPT. A diferença é que o chat incorporado ao BING foi aprimorado para as pesquisas, conseguindo fornecer respostas contextualizadas, com citação das fontes.Traz uma experiência diferente de bate-papo. Inclusive, essa conversa diferenciada já até virou notícia bem curiosa e engraçada até (😄) no “The New York Times” (confira neste link:https://bit.ly/3FlwUWs).✍️E você já experimentou escrever usando alguma dessas Inteligências Artificiais ou outras?

Eugene Gan,19,12 comments,8 reposts,"Tools maketh the person, or the person maketh the tools?ChatGPT and us.Let's first know the tools1. What is ChatGPT?Basically, it's built upon a language model AI called GPT-3. In simple terms, GPT-3 calculates the probability of the next word that makes sense, and strings them together to form sentences. The folks inopen.aifed GPT-3 with everything we know up to year 2021, using supervised and reinforced learning techniques. Although the core function of ChatGPT is to mimic human conversations, it's versatile enough to perform other functions from all that it learnt. It's also constantly learning from its interaction with human feedback.2. Some misconceptions.ChatGPT is omniscient.Even if we fed it all of what we know, including the library of Alexandria up to this very second, it won't know everything. Because we don't know everything. 'Nuff said.Well, at least it'll tell me what other people know, right?No. As it is fundamentally built as a language tool, it can SOMETIMES form very convincing and plausible sounding sentences regardless of how nonsensical it can be. This common problem is called Artificial Intelligence Hallucinations. It needs time to learn over time, through upvotes or downvotes plus some additional feedback from humans.Does that mean that ChatGPT will one day at least get the ""truth"" right? This is arguably the hardest thing even for us humans to do, even until today. Growing up, we subconsciously rank the quality of ""truth"" by how reliable the source of the information is. We ranked our teachers as reliable, and a stranger (for example) as unreliable. Let's break this down mathematically. If we think our teacher is 5x more reliable than a stranger, it'll take 6 strangers to make us doubt our teacher. Sounds reasonable? Amid all the different voices online, it can sometimes be challenging for us to differentiate the ""truths"" from the bent ones.3. Some current limitations.Bewear of typos.ChatGPT isn't too tolerant with typos. If you didn't even notice the typo at the beginning of this paragraph, it's because us humans are a lot more adaptable and tolerant to mistakes. We are capable of ""autocorrecting"" in real time, and with context. Computer systems are very literal. It assumes you are literal about what you're asking it. Garbage in, garbage out. Literally as simple as that.4. Use cases and potentials.Having said that, there are many uses for ChatGPT or other AI systems that I am very excited about. Ask it to find erroneous lines of software codes, it'll do well. It isn't ambiguous and relative to the person asking. From debugging software to writing essays, I think you've read enough great examples of AI's capabilities and accomplishments.I'm keeping a very keen eye on its development, and I think I might have identified a few industries and use cases for it. I'll be experimenting with my circle of friends and post our progress here.Stay tuned.#ai#chatgpt#artificialintelligence#development",1 day ago

It is a reference to insurance companies that have a technology-first operation model to handle the sales and management of insurance policies.What Is Digital Insurance?As the name implies, digital insurance is an insurance product offered online or through a mobile app. These platforms use a combination of live customer service and digital algorithms to write and price policies. A variety of coverage options and products is available through digital insurance companies, from auto insurance to home and renters coverage, life insurance, and even healthcare policies.While some of these companies are newer, standalone startups, many digital insurance providers are actually owned and backed by existing, trusted, and established names in the insurance industry.What are the benefits of digital insurance?Compared to the traditional insurance, digital insurance differs in the following ways: Offer a customer-first business approach.

Maryna Kuzmenko,68,3 comments,4 reposts,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Good Experimental Practice (GEP) is the niche area with huge impact on agriculture.As the demand for sustainable agriculture grows, the importance of GEP testing facilities for crop trials increases. However, the work in GEP is hugely based on data. Hence, now most of the GEP facilities face challenges such as high costs (try to buy a SPAD for research team with limited budget), time-consuming processes (spend hours in counting flower clusters), and inaccurate data collection (visual assessment of herbicides application).Artificial intelligence (AI) can help address these challenges by streamlining GEP testing processes and improving data accuracy. AI-powered solutions can automate data collection and analysis, reducing the need for manual labor and improving efficiency.However, even more important - AI algorithms can identify patterns and insights in the data that may not be visible to the human eye. For example, AI is not tired to process terrabytes of crop imagery in comparison with human who has 8-hour working limit (however, productivity limit is even smaller).Finally, AI can be used to analyze data from previous GEP trials to identify trends and patterns that can inform future tests. This can help facilities optimize their testing protocols and improve their results over time.That's why I am so proud ofPetiole AIand our mission to democratise access to the tools for plant phenotyping and yield forecast, particularly for small and medium size growers worldwide.I captured this photo today in the morning, when finalising our report on pest presence assessment using smartphone (AI model was trained only red chilli peppers, identifies contour of fruit and assesses potential presence or absence of pest inside)#AIinfarming#AIinagriculture#PetioleAI#chilli#chillies#gep#plantscience#cropyield#ai",17 hours ago

AlgoAnalytics,29,2 comments,5 reposts,"Have you ever been frustrated with your food delivery apps for not assigning a delivery partner quickly or your assigned airport gate being changed at the last minute?These presumably simple tasks of assigning partners to orders or gates to flights in the most efficient way is actually done with the help of a mathematical problem- The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) involves assigning a set of objects to a set of locations in a way that minimizes the total cost of the assignment. The cost of assigning an object to a location depends on the distance between the objects and the locations. The goal is to find the assignment that minimizes the total cost of all the assignments.For example, for a food delivery app, if we have a set of orders and a set of delivery partners, and we want to assign each partner to an order such that the transportation costs are minimized, then we can use the QAP to find the best assignment.Our team atAlgoAnalyticsis exploring the potential of quantum computing algorithms for solving the QAP. Another area of research is exploring the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve the QAP.Overall, the QAP is a fascinating optimization problem that will continue to be an important benchmark for evaluating the performance of optimization algorithms and for developing new methods for solving complex optimization problems in the future.#research#algorithms#team#computing",3 hours ago
