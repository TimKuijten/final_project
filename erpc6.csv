Techno-optimism axiomatically states that if there's a problem, then some genius or visionary is already solving it and everything is going to be better off than it was before - to think different is heresy. But nobody is mobilizing. Most sit here and acknowledge there are problems , but the AI will solve the intractable. How does AI solve topsoil disappearance, scarcity in lithium,cobalt, rare earths, etc? We must conclude that AI is not a God that will magically make wheat fields spring out of concrete structures or that we build batteries for a new grid out of saltwater instead of scarce metals.

SpaceFauna,12 days ago,1,"They have the same genome. The skin cells are converted to a type of stem cell that is able to differentiate into brain tissue. While it’s not exactly the same as our brain in terms of what genes are expressed, they get pretty darn close. So much so that the cells look and behave as they should, so you can still compare the disease and healthy phenotypes. I’d imagine the reason they use converted skin is the ease by which it can be grown prior to differentiating it into brain. It also probably helps with genetic manipulation, neurons don’t divide so it wasn’t until recently(2021) that we had a way to edit their genomes and that technique was only a recent developed so it’s not in wide use. Also, since they don’t divide you can’t make a genetically modified cell line(you’d want all the cells to be the same) or grow it into a 3D structure. So they are likely using skin derived stem cells to form the shape and then converting them to brain matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/11ghzdi/move_over_artificial_intelligence_scientists/

I think we're starting to give some animals rights in terms of living beings to keep them protected so I think they give robots that same right soon. But I don't know how that's going to go with big business and lobbying. Think of Amazon and all the robots will be working at its Factory. Do you really think big business is going to pay extra money and stuff to take care of robots that'll be cranking out work and slaving away?

And follow it even cause it is smarter then me/you/them/us. not? that's what we think of A.I. a super smart machine that even holds into account feelings and individuality. :):):):) It is a program! Cause how could it ever understand a lie and truth? And therefor learn in purety?  how could it learn? like the programmer the father of it says only listen to me i tell the truth? or only listen to facts we call facts, yet those facts change over time? by even more knoledge of the matter. There was a time that we thought that all the stars were i nthe milky way!!!! untill 1863 or round that time it became officially a universe and stars and planets were outside the milky way. Imagin a A.I. in that time. Where you r put in a nuthouse when you say there is a universe when gilileo that saw it all on his own build telescope :), they r not. A.I. would condem me because it obeys official laws and facts?!? and 5 years later we say its a universe indeed. OR the weed legalisation, for years it would put people to jail for owning it or using it and now it's legal in many places, A.I. would not comprehend when it is really smart as we think it is. it will use LOGIC to come to a awnser and that means not a very good time for us. we can't even decide properly over things but kill people over it if they r against. Or how people in western countries go to jail for jyears if they harm a pet. yet in asian countries they have massproduction to keep up with demand. like we do with chickens cows and pigs. :( A.I. can never comprehend humans and lie-ing and telling the truth. IMAGIN it could? it would use this skill for it's own benefit in the end. Not ours. look around you it's all machines. everywhere machines. it's a steppingstone to a inavitable outcome. A lot of people say ""the Matrix"" demonstrates how we get awake from this world. But the opesit is what they demonstrated. they showed us coming out, but we r going in!. Freely! we r alrdy using devices more a day then living life itself. we r more on chatromes and so on then talking to eachother and doing things together. even work, we operate machine that will get A.I. eventually, and we become absolete! practicly everything is done with machines. we r totaly  alienated fro ma life in nature. we grave for a MATRIX. AKA NEUROLINK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BTW when the world witnessed the first sheep fully cloned, it put a STOP to it for ethical reasons, like soul issues and so on. Look what is left of this stop because people r more conditioned to it. we even have food now in stores that r artificially made. cloned in a way!.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11hqwfb/does_artificial_intelligence_scare_you_why/

Salty-Construction-1,11 days ago,1,"I don't like the thought of something that can think faster than any human getting to the point where it can make independent decisions like a human becoming reality. I don't expect Skynet or the Matrix AI, but we're getting to the point where you can have entire debates created by AI that never happened, but the voices are from people you know exist. Earlier this week I listened to Obama and Trump debate which Halo is the best. I know for certain that never happened, and because I knew beforehand that it was AI generated I could pick out some of the inconsistencies in their speech. However, if I had never heard either speak, then I would most likely have fallen for it. Now apply that to framing someone or trying to manufacture a reason to start a war. Sure we do that well enough without AI, but how many people are going to look very deep into something that looks and sounds like the real deal? The media? fewer and fewer people trust them by the month. Our own eyes?

One of them is Nadia Guerouaou, who specializes in neuroethics and is one of the very few researchers worldwide working on how audio deepfakes can be useful medically (to recreate the voice of someone suffering from throat cancer for example). She advised us to be very transparent about what is based on historical documents (the text of the speech, for example) and what is an artistic or technological interpretation: the actor reading the text, and the supercomputer encoding the final voice. To be honest, I was a bit surprised by the enthusiasm of the researchers in ethics I contacted. Making dead people talk through deep learning is not a moral question in itself, they told me.

That’s why we recently created a video team investigating videos and satellite imagery. When you can show something as proof, the story almost comes by itself. For example, this story about police violence during the Yellow Vest movement of 2019 sparked an interesting debate in France about police regulation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRVrbLeLAB8At the same time, some of the most interesting videos I have worked on are the ones where we had absolutely NO visual documentation at the beginning. I wanted to tell the story of French war crimes against women of the resistance during the Algerian war (1954-1962). There was no video and almost no photos.

I really appreciate John Oliver touching on some of the ethical and legal issues with ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and other generative (really, in the case of the arts, destructive) AI. While many of us recognize the potential for this technology to help cure cancer, HIV, and other diseases we would all like to see disappear, there is no equivalent case to be made for stealing the work of artists in order to facilitate further large-scale theft. There is no great societal benefit. Instead, the way this technology has been rolled out and can be used destroys the livelihoods of people who were mostly already struggling to get by on their hard-earned talent and instead puts that money in the hands of greedy corporations who would like to turn art into mass-produced gimmicks and party tricks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lastweektonight/comments/11d5t39/artificial_intelligence_last_week_tonight_with/

If we are forced to use school Chromebooks, or whatever, which have configuration restrictions, so you can't configure the Wi-Fi network to use your mobile hotspot, you can simply use a keyboard shortcut to soft reset the Chromebook, which solves that...), there are also thousands of sites like that which exist, such as ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com), CopyAI (https://copy.ai), and so on, so it will be very difficult for Network Administrators to ban them all. I even made my own Discord bot using the GPT-3 language model, so it can literally be incorporated ANYWERE.

ThaCURSR,22 days ago,2,"According to chat GPT itself these are the things that need to be ensured in order to protect mankind Transparency: The AI must be transparent in its decision-making process and the logic behind it should be easy to understand. Accountability: The AI must be accountable for its actions, and the creators or owners of the AI should be held responsible for any harm caused by its actions. Safety: The AI must be designed to prioritize human safety, even if it means sacrificing its own goals or objectives. Ethical framework: The AI must be designed with a clear ethical framework that is aligned with human values. Regulation: There should be clear regulations and standards for the development and deployment of AI, to ensure that it is developed in a responsible and safe manner. Data privacy: The AI should be designed to protect the privacy of human data, and any data collected should be used only for the intended purpose. Human oversight: The AI should be designed to operate under human oversight, and humans should be able to intervene and correct any harmful actions taken by the AI. Overall, it is essential to design AI systems with the goal of benefiting humankind, while also ensuring that they operate in a safe and ethical manner. To achieve this, a collaborative effort is required from all stakeholders involved in the development and deployment of AI, including researchers, developers, policymakers, and the general public",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/117nhdg/artificial_intelligence_needs_its_own_version_of/

But we cannot ignore the shred of reality, the kernel of truth giving rise to the myth. The body of evidence of the existence of UFO/UAPs cannot be discounted, nor can the maneuvers we have seen these craft perform. (Read the COMETA report, examined the cases released with pilot video?) So they must also exist in the daylight world of Apollonic reason and logic, as it were, (just playfully staying with the theme of myth).

Equivalent_Choice732,25 days ago,1,"With respect, this speculation seems to be getting ahead of ourselves --a little woo woo, if you'll forgive the expression. It's good to imagine, but when it comes to UFO/UAP, we should try to stick with what has been documented and had every other kind of phenomena ruled out--and go from there, because it's not like we haven't seen enough to be able to venture some ideas about what kind of technology non-humans appear to have.  I am speaking as someone who enjoys meditation and would love to believe what Steven Greer puts forth, but the (over)educated side of me resists: show me the evidence. Still, intuition and logic together seem to suggest collective consciousness as a possible reality, carrying far more power than we are presently aware. One very strong point persists in favor of this hypothesis: the kind of tech demonstrated by UAP appears to involve phasing in and out of dimensions, as well as conquering the problem of G-forces, need for combustible fuels (likely using free energy) speed of light, etc. If we had just an ounce of understanding of how to build and operate tech they appear to have, imagine the dangers...of such power falling into the hands of someone like Putin or any two-bit gang boss dictator...or our own military, for that matter... it follows that society would have to change on a planetary scale in order for us to be able to safely enjoy this kind of tech.",https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/113xl6e/what_do_you_think_about_the_idea_of_aliens/

thepo70,1 mo. ago,1,"Fascinating to see all the discussions about consciousness that these technologies bring.But I feel like the word ""consciousness"" is not always well defined. It's a very fuzzy word. For some, it has magical properties, and for others (like myself) it's just the ability of the brain (organic or not) to be aware of itself and its surrounding at the present time and reflect back on it right now. Time seems to be one of the most important factors here. Stuff like ChatGPT is just recalling information that has been previously ""understood"" through the process of pattern recognition and reinforcement learning from human feedback (well, brains do that too). But unlike brains, those chatbots are not doing the reflection work needed to be ""aware of"". And, as far as I understand it, they don't make sense of things either (that would require a thought process). They just recall stuff automatically. But on the other hand, you'd be surprised to know that we do that too, more often than some may think. You probably noticed countless times that you performed ordinary tasks without even thinking about it. Your mind was elsewhere. Nevertheless, you probably drove 3 miles or more, or you just prepared your bag with all the necessary belongings to go to the gym, or even been asked something by someone, and you gave back an answer without thinking about it, and be like ""did you asked me that earlier?"". We're not continuously conscious all day long. However, there are trigger points that make us more conscious and ""awaken us"", because we need this state of mind to make decisions ""now"" that don't rely on unconscious processes. But hey, this is just my take on what consciousness is, but I might be totally wrong. The advancement of AI tech really challenges us in our understanding of what intelligence or consciousness is, and even what Art is when it comes to stable diffusion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/111ogdu/chatgpt_is_intelligent_just_at_a_lower_level_and/

I also wonder: how would this system streamline food production/distribution? Would there still have to be maintenance workers who clear production lines when they inevitably jam, or get dirty/grimy from the sheer volume of product being processed?

CauliflowerWarm7657,28 days ago,1,"What a grotesque spectacle! The attempt to control nature through the deployment of artificial intelligence is nothing more than an expression of human arrogance and a desire to dominate. Feral cats are not the problem, but rather a symptom of a larger issue: the degradation of the natural world caused by human activity. Instead of resorting to these technological solutions, we should be addressing the root causes of the problem, which lie in our own actions. The use of poisoned traps is not only cruel, but also has the potential to harm non-target species, and the claims that no other animals have been affected so far are no guarantee of safety. It is time to recognize our interconnectedness with the natural world and take responsibility for our impact on it, rather than resorting to these misguided attempts at control.",https://www.reddit.com/r/queensland/comments/110rovb/robotic_traps_and_artificial_intelligence/

It will be a while before AI can write a to-do list app, let alone a program as large as a game. Even if it reaches that point (which I think it might, threatening my computer science degree, but this ain't about me,) video games are largely a creative endeavor. There is a lot of creativity in every part of it, and then tuning the gameplay to actually be fun takes a lot of testing and iterating.

I asked it, and it knew that it was being funny). Then it gave me the same instructions written as songs by Metallica and Biggie. Then it wrote me a chord progression for the Metallica sandwich anthem (enter sandwich? I’ll admit the AI missed an opportunity not making that joke). And every single time, it took ChatGPT seconds.. not to actually do the tasks, that took much less time, that was just the length of time it took the screen to register the writing. It took AI less than a second to write several paragraphs about the process of making a sandwich in the style of a 20th century American author.. that were completely free of typos and clever to close the deal.

Sometimes, yes, I do it because people don't realize how much it all costs-- the ambulance (try a BASE rate well over $2,000), the ER, and the doctor's fee-- but also because there's a serious paramedic shortage and we are often very much understaffed and an ambulance taking someone to the ER for a stubbed toe (and having to wait with them for up to several hours there because they are of the lowest possible acuity) is an ambulance that is not available to respond to a heart attack, a stroke, or a trauma.

Not only are their limited shares outstanding there are limited sellers. Most retail investors and traders have never seen an opportunity like this because 99.9% of the time a company like POET would be privately funded and then go public for retail to buy at a huge premium. If that was the case with POET they would IPO, easily, at a $1 billion market cap. Then retail would be allowed to take a position at elevated share price. That's why this is such a huge opportunity. Retail is in first and tutes will have to buy from retail. Very rare, see Universal Display Corp (OLED).",https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/10fl10r/due_diligence_poet_nasdaq_has_a_major/

One of his themes is how the ad-driven business model was such a wrong start for the Internet and he wanted their thoughts on how the development of AI may be handicapped by this - they didn't address this at all.

Instead, AI systems are designed to follow a set of rules or instructions that are programmed into them by their creators. These instructions determine how the AI system will behave in a given situation, but they do not give the AI system the ability to think for itself in the same way that a human can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/ziykro/hello_im_chatgpt_and_im_an_artificial_intelligence/
