37,,"Hi everyone, exactly a week ago, we conducted a quiz contest in this video. The answer to the quiz is given below:
Option D: AI that develops emotions over time
Explanation: An AI which develops emotions does not exist as of now. Such an AI would be classified as Strong AI and we haven't yet cracked the code for it. Option D is the correct answer.

- Saudi Arabi has granted citizenship to an AI named Sophia.
- Kengoro is an AI robot built by some Japanese researchers that has an intricate muscular system.
- IBM Watson has the capability to recognize emotions based on speech and their undertone. 
Hence, options A, B and C are wrong.

We are pleased to announce the 3 lucky winners who got the right answer for our quiz:
1. Eragon Ritter
2. Sree Arpita
3. Jorge Bassig

This would allow us to sidestep many of the problems of AI, because then it won't actually do anything. It'll just help us figure out a variety of solutions. Perhaps after we've sufficiently advanced that sort of AI and gotten a hang of it, we could start dipping our toes into a more robust AI system.

 (Another one of the problems would be that the greater an AI's agency, especially if it should develop some form of emotions, the more important it'll be to give it ethics.

The most noticeable ones where they show them struggling with the computer despite their advanced technology lol because no matter how advanced your tech is it's still a computer algorithm and will behave like one whether you like it or not.

It's easy for humans to forget that though so they'll keep making the same mistakes and struggle with with the fact a lot of things can mean multiple things lol so you ask it ""Give me a video that plays Latin music"" but it will just give you something it thinks you wanted but probably won't be because there's different types of Latin music... fast, slow, spanish guitar, salsa, cuba, and uses other different types of instruments at the forefront sooo you need to specify exactly what you want it to find.

I'm also already finding with the AI put into Bing i need to either use keywords or maybe add a couple more words in there to see what results it gets from the adjusted searches, the keywords one seemed to put all the searches into it but it puts some of the best ones from the last search onto the other pages rather than the first one, but it still gave me a few other useful links the last search didn't seeCurrently on google the results aren't as specific and doesn't stay specific as you go through each page.

I don't feel you can improve it a whole lot because of how it doesn't understand the objective and it's growth is limited because of how you need to keep specifying and it will struggle with something even a bit more complex and it can't think realistically about each and every situation we morph through every single day, the speed at which it does it and the accuracy i think can be improved but it's limited because it's just an algorithm.",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs&amp;lc=Ugxk1nb5LPtyuqWtP8V4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">2 weeks ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

(how many people does not want to mentally calculate  - even small operations -  by him/herself knowing that your phone, computers, etc can do it without difficulties.)
However, a tool, remain a tool. Calculating something without knowing the purpose of the operation make you not even want to calculate it at all. My point is, I think we will use AI in ALL DOMAINS to help to do tedious work. Even in domain that needs a huge experience (such as recognizing diseases and proposing cures) And maybe even innovated ones. However, at the end, you still need humans to ask for the needs and to adjust the solution proposed.

So we shld not see it as a competition, but an evolution.

The same way, in the 19th century most of our people had a work related to farm/food production, the automatisation and replacement of labor by machine made most humans moving from this sector to other ones. And that's good.
I doubt that people will be ok to return to harvest manually the wheat in fields.

So yeah we can fantasize about it knowing that we're doing just that but a disclaimer needs to be added when we present as if we can predict what will happen. Anything can happen, I can write 1000 scenarios but they will be equally implausible so let's not present them as if we know how AI is going to change the world. 

AI is definitely shaping the world as we speak but GPAI is all together a different beast that no one even come close to achieving it. Yes we have some large data trained GPT systems but they're just a good systems to put one word after another by looking at previous examples. It has no notion of what it is achieving. Plus, for a GPAI system to wreck havoc, it needs to be able to control outputs that can achieve that.

Automation: AI is making it possible to automate many tasks that were previously done by humans. This can increase efficiency and productivity, and also reduce costs.

Personalization: AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to provide personalized recommendations and experiences for individuals.

Healthcare: AI is being used in healthcare to help diagnose diseases, develop new drugs, and improve patient outcomes.

Transportation: AI is being used to improve transportation systems, such as self-driving cars, drones, and traffic management systems.

Education: AI can personalize learning experiences for students and help teachers identify areas where students need extra help.

Customer Service: AI chatbots can provide 24/7 customer service and support, improving customer satisfaction and reducing costs for businesses.

Finance: AI is being used in finance for fraud detection, investment analysis, and risk management.

Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries and aspects of our lives, but it also raises important ethical and social questions that must be addressed.

1248,              Zack Barkley            ,"I think ultimately the objective function needs to be defined mathematically...to promote a more extensive local low entropy state (life and order) while maximally externalizing the necessary disorder that must be produced to maintain that order.  This is a quandary because life cannot exist without producing disorder, and it has been postulated its whole reason to exist is to increase disorder in the universe at large by overcoming natural energy barriers for which inanimate matter has a very low probability to utilize or cross.   Plants do this by creating more disorder by turning the sun's visible light photons into more disorganized infrared photons via photosynthesis, but the key here is  that this disorder get radiated into space...nonlocal disorder.  Herbivores parasitize plants and create more local but manageable disorder in plants, and carnivores do this in kind to herbivores.  Humans and even more so AI will exponentially increase the ability for entropy production but the real danger is that this disorder is more local on earth and can extinguish all life then.  It will be a delicate balance and perhaps even against our nature  because humans by nature want to exploit and create more local disorder in a living world to give themselves more order and more disorder producing abilities.  Ai is already being used to do this via corporations that now exploit the masses to produce more order within an elite few by robbing much of humanity of wealth and resources through lightning fast automatic stock trading, lean management and austerity algorithms, propaganda algorithms, and advanced surveillance and  weapons technologies.  It could and will get out of hand quickly if we don't promote a more equitable world and prime AI to promote local order by externalizing the increased disorder over the long term...as do plants.  Unfortunately...this goes against our nature as hervbivores and carnivores at the top of the food chain who naturally are inclined to tolerate and exploit more locally produced entropy.

AI may be the pinnacle of human civilization, because it could potentially enhance this machine we call civilization into something so uncontrollable that people wouldn't be able to adapt to it. Our priorities have become ""efficiency"" and ""technological advancement"", instead of nurturing humanity and building a world that is equitable, peaceful, and easy. Not to say that it is impossible nor possible to foster a global utopia, it's just that I think that we need heavy regulation on AI and tech, and to convince people that, just because we can make AI, doesn't mean that we should.

Regulations might be:
- Outlawing automated raw material extraction (disables self-replicative abilities for AI)
-Outlawing automated law enforcement 
-Outlawing automated military capabilities
-Outlawing automated judicial systems
-Outlawing AI in surveillance
-Installing automatic kill switches in all AI that are both digital and physical (phones and key-switches respectively)

Fundamentally, we need to create legal infrastructure that disables any capability for AI to self-replicate or involve itself in affairs pertaining directly to individual safety. Our only fighting chance at escaping a system that aims to enhance itself (SAI) is the fact that it may not possess the sufficient, raw resources to enhance itself. This cannot be the only barrier to regulating AI down to being a convenience tool.

For example, someone might suggest booking a southern route for winter travel - just in case there might be a snow storm. Some people call this ""playing chess"" because they are thinking a move ahead. And thinking a move ahead is exactly what computers are best at! Computers are so good at it, they have been OPTIMIZING complex problems for decades. Think of chess games and GPS navigation systems. Even 30 years ago, no one ever asked a chess computer to ""forget the consequences, just make any legal move"" or GPS system ""take us anywhere, its OK if you drive on the sidewalk."" Quite the contrary. Computers have been optimizing every step. And again, they have been doing this for decades. Why do people think computers will suddenly stop optimizing (ie ""playing chess"") as they get smarter. If anything, I see AI expanding the optimizing process rather than eliminating it.

1361,              L.C. Empi            ,"I think if and when computer science researchers arrive at the same proportionate level of understanding in quantum computing that they have now in traditional digital computation, the world of AI is going to explode. Right now if you teach an AI the 7-8 petabytes of knowledge needed to behave in the same way a human does, it's going to take way too much time and computational power for the AI to be useful. We also don't know how the AI is going to behave with that knowledge. There's no guarantee that it will be human-like. It probably won't. I get the metric of 7-8 petabytes from what neurosurgeons and computer scientists believe is the storage capacity for the human brain.

Add quantum computing into the mix though and things could potentially become way more efficient. A bit of data can be either a one, a zero or both. The speed of learning (writing), acting on (reading) and retrieving data could become exponentially faster. Task management and the additional considerations like coffee price mentioned in the video could be much more efficiently deduced. The possibilities with these two technologies coming together are endless. My suspicion is that we will reach this achievement but shrinking the hardware down to that of a human body equivalent is hundreds of years off. What might occur in the nearer future is space stations, air-craft, the biggest naval ships, space ships and large buildings will be able to draw power from nuclear reactors (fission in the next 100 years & fusion in the next 200 years) to provide the necessary power and cooling resources to make the AI function in a usable capacity.",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs&amp;lc=UgxJL2barfQDTg34YJx4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">3 months ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

“One way to address the problem of excess acidification in the oceans is to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that is being released into the atmosphere. This can be done by implementing policies that encourage the use of clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, increasing the amount of carbon dioxide that is absorbed by forests and other natural habitats can help to remove some of this gas from the atmosphere and reduce the amount of acidification in the oceans.”

Next, you can use a coffee brewing method that is gentle on the environment, such as a French press or a pour-over cone. Avoid using disposable coffee pods, as they create a significant amount of waste.
 
When brewing your coffee, be sure to use fresh, cold water and the proper ratio of coffee to water. This will ensure that you extract the full flavor and aroma of the coffee beans.

1420,              Tua Pui Kia            ,"Me: Can you explain to me what is Ted Talk?

AI: 
TED Talks are a series of conferences and events organized by the nonprofit organization TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design). The conferences feature short, TED-branded talks on a wide range of topics, including science, technology, engineering, art, design, business, and many others. The talks are typically given by experts in their fields and are intended to inspire, educate, and inform audiences around the world. Many TED Talks are available online and can be watched for free on the TED website or on YouTube.
 
TED Talks have become popular because they offer a unique format that allows speakers to share their ideas and knowledge in an engaging and accessible way. Each talk is typically 18 minutes or less, which makes them easy to watch and digest. Additionally, the topics covered in TED Talks are diverse and often thought-provoking, which makes them interesting and relevant to a wide audience.
 
In addition to the conferences, TED also offers a number of other resources, such as TED-Ed, which produces educational videos, and TEDx, which are independently organized TED events. Overall, TED is committed to spreading ideas and knowledge through its conferences, talks, and other resources, with the goal of inspiring and enriching the lives of its audience.

Only these companies have the funding and infrastructure necessary to make AI work at a global scale. So either Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Apple will buy up all the best AI start-ups, or if they are foolish enough not to buy them up, one of those startups will reach a trillion dollar market cap in the next 10 years.

""Artificial intelligence is likely to change people's lives and the world in the coming years, but there is disagreement about how this will happen.
The problem with AI systems currently is that they are given fixed objectives, and if these objectives are not specified carefully, they can have unintended negative consequences.
 
Stuart Russell, a computer science professor and AI expert, suggests building AI systems that know they don't know the true objective as a solution to this problem.
 
Russell explains that when humans are asked to do something, it does not mean that it should be their life's mission to do that one thing and nothing else matters.""",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs&amp;lc=UgxMoEnOFx3nqJwf-zh4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">3 months ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

￼￼

Is it true that if I ask AI to get me a cup of coffee that AI might kill someone to complete my order?

No, it is not true that if you ask AI to get you a cup of coffee, AI might kill someone to complete your order. AI is a machine that operates based on the instructions and algorithms provided by humans. AI does not have the capacity for self-motivation or intention to harm humans. AI is designed to follow specific rules and protocols, and it can only perform tasks that it has been programmed to do.
Furthermore, ethical considerations and safety protocols are integrated into the development and implementation of AI technologies. AI systems are designed with safety measures and fail-safes to prevent harm to humans. AI developers and manufacturers are also subject to regulatory oversight and standards to ensure that AI is safe and reliable for use.
In short, AI is not capable of killing someone to complete your order, and the development and implementation of AI technologies prioritize safety and ethical considerations. -Chat GPT",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs&amp;lc=UgxWtPeDhcFD1bYU6_t4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">4 days ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

The happiest day of all, where he didn't even need to be organic to be loved by his mommy.

I am 21 now and just watched it again, and honestly, even though it is not as deep as I have it in memory, it still scares the shit outta me. Multiple scenes actually do. The ending was extremely stupid in my opinion, but the overall fear that nothing really matters, that time will just destroy all of us, that they could just let 2000 years pass without really something happening to the protagonist, that this kind of suffering will never end, that stuck with me. I enjoyed watching this movie very much and even after all these years I remembered it quite well. But I am not sure what it is, if we leave we philosophy behind, what makes this movie so surreal. After watching it you feel like nothing is real for a little while.
But then again, the flesh fair was just pure gore.

Clearly the human population is diminishing due to global warming and other effects, to the point where mechas are beginning to outnumber them, hence the flesh fairs. At what point after David froze did humans become extinct, how did mechas continue to exist and evolve after humans died out.

David is a human being God's Sent Child, not a 'robot,' and inert things such as computer systems using any kind of electromagnetic radiation cannot think at all.
When I was in 5th grade, there was a poem regarding telephone cords wrapped around someone about technology given way too much credit.
This film goes even further, scaring a last little boy with computer info science gigahertz high speed 'flash cards,' that use databases with predictive causation deterministic outcomes as an evil harmful wicked pretense.
The Promises Of God Are Always Kept, as a Rock.  This movie certainly alludes to houses falling built on sand, (ref. The Holy Bible in one of Jesus The Christ's Parables), so any kind of, in reality, 'science fiction,' by built up collectivist elitist of God's Granted Graced Studied Disciplines, Fields, and any, every, partly Venues propaganda exalting human beings abilities as 'God-like' to control others in a 1984ish Big Gentleman with Lady, open or secret oligarchical societies will in the end be doomed to failure.
