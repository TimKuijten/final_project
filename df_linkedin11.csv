Vincent Callebaut,4,,,"TIMBER TWINGO, Reinventing Twingo forRenault, Engineered Wood Concept Car designed byVincent CallebautArchitecturesLess but better. For the 30th anniversary of the Renault Twingo city car, we propose to lighten its weight and its ecological footprint by using natural plant fibers and timber-based materials for both its structure and its interior design.Since the beginnings of the automobile, wooden cars have been built. The tradition obviously comes from horse-drawn carriages whose construction mainly used this material. And the name bodywork derives from the carriages.Now, in our cities, it is the end of heavy steel SUVs, giving way to electric or biofuels based, lightweight, agile, and go-anywhere car like Twingo.Environmental and social issues are putting increasing pressure on automakers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimize urban smog. As such, beyond the mix of energy used (electricity, biofuels, hydrogen fuel), vehicle weight is one of the main characteristics affecting the amount of CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to turn to the weight of the materials used to improve this characteristic of the vehicles.Many lightweight materials such as aluminum, magnesium and some recycled plastics are increasingly being used alongside steel. But what about plant fibers and engineered wood?CLT (Cross Laminated Timber) consists of superimposing perpendicularly thin wooden slats and connecting them together using structural, now-organic adhesives such as tannins, lignin, cellulose, or even starch. The Cross Laminated Timber manufacturing process requires much less energy than steel and allows a global weight reduction of 60%. In terms of fire resistance, remember that wood burns slowly, does not release toxic fumes, and transmits heat 250 times slower than melting steel.Both electric or hydrogen-powered, automated, and made mostly of cellulose fiber (coming from agricultural wastes) and structural engineered wood, as CLT (made with compressed Spruce, Southern Yellow Pine, and Douglas cultivated in eco-responsible PEFC forest), our prototype and its sustainable life-cycle could become the greenest concept car yet to be adopted by the entire automobile industry.In the constant search for innovation and at the heart of our ecological commitment, the poetry of natural wood marries technology to fully express the true essence of wood by bringing together beauty, industrial production, robustness, and comfort in this Timber Car.#ReinventTwingo#Twingo30#Renault#sustainable#mobility#transport#timber#wood#recycle#plantbased#lightweight#hydrogen#electric#vehicle#car#automotive#conceptcar#cardesign#ai#midjourney#stablediffusion#dalle2#ecology#architecture#design#lessismore#energy#interiordesign#technology#zerowaste#circulareconomy#vincentcallebaut#vincentcallebautarchitectures#beauty",4 minutes ago

Alexander Willbränder,0,,,"#GoodNews> Bio Computing – die Zukunft des Rechnens? > Biologisches Rechnen (oder Biocomputing) könnte schneller, effizienter und leistungsfähiger sein als Silizium-basiertes Rechnen und künstliche Intelligenz und nur einen Bruchteil der Energie benötigen.Die ""organoide Intelligenz"" (OI) beschreibt ein neu entstehendes multidisziplinäres Gebiet, das an der Entwicklung des biologischen Rechnens unter Verwendung von 3D-Kulturen menschlicher Gehirnzellen (Hirnorganoide) und Technologien für Gehirn-Maschine-Schnittstellen arbeitet.Die OI erfordert die Vergrößerung der derzeitigen Hirnorganoide zu komplexen, dauerhaften 3D-Strukturen, die mit Zellen und Genen angereichert sind, die mit dem Lernen in Verbindung stehen und die Verbindung dieser Strukturen mit Eingabe- und Ausgabegeräten der nächsten Generation sowie mit KI- und maschinellen Lernsystemen.Die künstliche Intelligenz erfordert neue Modelle, Algorithmen und Schnittstellentechnologien, um mit Hirnorganoiden zu kommunizieren, zu verstehen, wie sie lernen und rechnen, und die riesigen Datenmengen, die sie erzeugen, zu verarbeiten und zu speichern.Die OI-Forschung könnte auch unser Verständnis der Entwicklung des Gehirns, des Lernens und des Gedächtnisses verbessern und möglicherweise dazu beitragen, Behandlungen für neurologische Störungen wie Demenz zu finden.Illustration:#awillbraender#GenImage#MidJourney#BioComputer#BioRechner#Hirnorganoide#KI#Kybernetik#OrganoideIntelligenzQuelle / Weiterlesen >https://lnkd.in/eHaRRstX",7 minutes ago

Maxim Poulsen,7,4 comments,,"What does it take to become an expert?Hint: it’s not 10,000 hours.This theory was popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in the 2000s, based on the research of Anders Ericsson.Ericsson didn’t like Gladwell’s theory, and called it:→ ""An incorrect interpretation of his research""→ ""A provocative generalization""→ ""An oversimplification""10,000 hours was the average number of hours that promising 20-year-old violinists had practiced.The number was chosen because it’s catchy and easy.---So, if not the hours? What should we strive for?There are 4 more conditions:1. Many repetitions + feedback→ Developers write 100s of lines of code→ Content creators write 100s of posts→ Sales do 100s of discovery callsEach one gets feedback:→ Developers see if their code runs or not→ Content creators see if they get reach→ Sales see if they convertWithout repetition + feedback:You’re at best random.2. Valid environmentRegularities make outcomes predictable.You wouldn’t call a gambler a professional.Even if they have 10 000 hours of roulette.Because a roulette wheel is random.Stocks are another example of low validity.S&P 500 has better returns than 90% of funds.Why?Low validity.3. Timely feedbackImmediate vs Delayed feedback.Recruitment is a great example here:→ Startups with smaller team get faster feedback.→ Big companies might never even get feedback.This makes it hard to recognize patterns.Probably one of the explanations of Price’s Law.(More on that in another post)4. Deliberate practiceRemember when you were learning to drive?At first it was challenging, and required thought.But a few weeks into it, muscle memory kicks in.The same goes if you’re:→ Playing the same song→ Reading the same books→ Doing the same exercicesTo learn, push beyond your comfort zone.Studies show that in certain domains,Domains where these 4 don’t exist,It’s impossible to become an expert.So be wary of experts that aren’t ones.What are you becoming an expert at? ✌️Image: Midjourney#growth#10000hours#expert",9 minutes ago

Shubhie Goswamy,0,,,"The fashion industry is often associated with glitz and glamour, with the final product taking center stage, but the story behind the making of each garment is a stark contrast. This photography series aims to bridge that gap by showcasing the people and the conditions behind garment manufacturing, while also highlighting the waste generated by the industry.I chose to highlight Nike because its long time use of sweatshops, dating back to the 1970s. Their cultural significance, popularity, and the graphic logo visible on all their products, make them instantly recognisable and thus a perfect example. While Nike has changed it’s policies, it’s years of exploitative labour practises left a blueprint for many other companies to follow, built on finding the lowest cost of labor possible, outsourcing their labor overseas in countries with the lowest wages and terrible working conditions, which led to child labor and exploitation. These practices are still used by a lot of fast fashion brands, in an attempt to keep costs down, at the expense of their labour.Let's never forget the stark contrast between consumer and labour.All AI Images have been generated using Midjourney on Discord.

Sandu Baciu,1,1 comment,,"A Tribute to the Great Masters of Fantasy Art and ComicsWith AI revolutionizing almost everything, there is an incredible influx of mixed-bag image outputs in the styles of different artists. Some are so obvious as Moebius, some have a more painterly style like Frazetta or Vallejo, and some are just simply great comic pencilers or inkers like Buscema, but with colors!You can combine your idea with an artistic medium (say, oil paint or watercolor) and an inker reference, and the results are opening new gates of creativity. I noticed that sometimes, even if an artist is not mentioned, if you explain the mood, light, or even the composition, AI will probably find and use references from great masters.We are already at an accelerated pace of hybrid art creation, and I will not be surprised if the loop effect comes into play as well, with artists start doing drafts with AI and refining by hand for final images.Time will tell the ways to go..Enjoy!🙏Check my YouTube videos (and thanks to subscribe 🤗 )Sci-Fi YouTube link :https://lnkd.in/eiBTNc42My books:https://lnkd.in/e3XBDabz#ai#midjourney#architecture#interiordesign#stone#fun#midjourneyarchitecture#midjourneyai#architect#archdaily#artificialinspiration#aidesign#asce#dailymidjourney#neural_architecture#neuralarchitecture#artificialintelligence#people#robots#robotics#aicccreators#aiccdailytheme#midjourneyartwork#aiartdailytheme#artificialintelligenceartActivate to view larger image,",11 minutes ago
Alessia Pizzi,0,,,"In the common imagination, ""the chosen one"" evokes both the big and small screen, between demon-children and blonde and athletic vampire slayers. In Sulpicia's case, the story is a bit sadder because it highlights the loneliness of a poetess in ancient Rome, but above all it highlights the difficulty of critics to recognize this woman's literary talent.

Jennifer Hotai,1,,,"ChatGPT prompt: ""Write a LinkedIn post that describes how a growing city like Myrtle Beach can benefit from being a smart city, with blockchain and metaverse technology.""💡As Myrtle Beach continues to grow and attract more visitors and residents, there's an opportunity to leverage technology to enhance the city's infrastructure and services. Imagine a city that can offer personalized experiences to its visitors, optimize its transportation systems, and ensure that its residents have access to secure and reliable digital services.👉🏽That's where being a smart city comes in, and blockchain and metaverse technology can play a key role in making that vision a reality.💎Blockchain technology can help establish secure and transparent systems for managing transactions, such as property purchases and public services. This can help reduce bureaucracy and streamline processes, ultimately leading to a more efficient and effective city government.💎Additionally, the use of blockchain can enhance cybersecurity, protecting the city's sensitive data from hackers and other malicious actors.💎Metaverse technology can offer unique opportunities for tourism and entertainment in Myrtle Beach. Visitors could explore virtual versions of the city's attractions before even arriving, creating a sense of excitement and anticipation. Once they arrive, they could use augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences to enhance their visit and learn more about the city's history and culture.💎Furthermore, metaverse technology can help promote economic development by offering new opportunities for businesses. Virtual storefronts and marketplaces could be established, allowing businesses to expand their reach beyond the physical limitations of their brick-and-mortar locations.💎In short, the benefits of becoming a smart city with blockchain and metaverse technology are numerous and far-reaching.

The time it’d take to coordinate such a massive experience, curate the design, create copy, and develop a supporting plan of action- is something that takes most festival/talent management teams a year or more to finalize. We had only 100 days.The decision to move forward in trying to produce this event wasn’t solidified until early December.We all agreed that if we committed- we were in it together, no matter how hard things got.The moment the decision was final- my clients took of to Egypt. They knew being there in person would allow them to make quick, meaningful decisions-After a week long visit they returned with a list of personally-approved options, excursions and experiences to share with our community- It was time to plan.Our 8 days and 7 nights adventure from October 22-29 this year, will have attendees journeying across the ancient cities of Luxor and Aswan, with the crescendo of the experience encompassing 5 days and 4 nights on the Nile River.It will feature over 15 iconic house music DJs from across the world including the iconic David Morales, The Grammy Nominated Terry Hunter, and the Soulful Shaman Scott Houston.The final contracts were delivered yesterday to confirm the Lineup- and the last 36 hours straight has been a focused build and test session to ensure everything is user-ready.——⤵️⤵️⤵️Midjourney allowed me to explore and create a final set of assets that is 100% unique.*Egyptian themed photo frames*Iconic Egyptian landscapes,*Event flyers (that just needed small tweaks and overlays in PS)*Text bubbles*Overlay effects*Egyptian Themed Icon SetsChatGPT + the AIPRM Chrome plug-in has powered*The live copy on the site*Live posts across all social media*A 6 month content calendar*SEO optimized framework for blog posts and relevant topical discussions + keywords—————-The capacity to produce pointed, targeted, high-quality content— or at least to produce some amazing visual and verbal references is so insane with AI.The power for it to elevate brands and entrepreneurs through organization and efficiency is incredible.More of the story coming soon—- until then, I’d love to hear about some of your favorite recent AI experiences.

ChatGPT helpt met het schrijven van teksten, analyses, het maken van een uittreksel van een boek, en meer.Zelfs mijn pitch van 45 seconden, morgen bij ons BNI chapter “#BestBusinessOnline” zou ik door een bot kunnen laten schrijven. Ware het niet dat het voor mij veel leuker is om zelf wat “catchy” te bedenken.Voor mij als illustrator is een andere tak van A.I. nuttiger. Mijn jaarabonnement op Midjourney is de beste investering van het jaar. Midjourney helpt me bij het maken van illustraties. Tot op bepaalde hoogte, dat dan weer wel.Slechts wat aan wat knoppen draaien, en voilá? Vergeet het maar. Om dicht bij het beoogde resultaat te komen is goede kennis van “prompting” een must. Het wordt dan ook wel “prompt-engineering” genoemd. (prompting is het invoeren van de juiste instructies)Voor mijn voornaamste tak-van-sport “uitleg-illustraties” is A.I. ook niet echt geschikt. Daarvoor zijn de opdrachten die ik doe, té specifiek. Kijk maar eens opwww.studioomega.nlHet vaakst log ik nog in op Midjourney, om inspiratie op te doen.

Letícia Tainara Souza,5,3 comments,,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, histórico de tendências e evoluções, aqui vão algumas das tendências de marketing para 2023:🤳🏻 Marketing de influência: o marketing de influência chegou pra ficar e continuará a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conteúdo para alcançar públicos específicos (Ó a base da Virginia aí, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).🎁 Personalização: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experiência personalizada e relevante, e as empresas estão investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estratégias para atender a essa demanda.📼 Vídeo marketing: o vídeo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produção de vídeo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Então investe nisso. A era dos estáticos morreu).🔊 Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas estão começando a adotar estratégias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personalização também).📩 Marketing de conteúdo: este continuará a desempenhando um papel importante na construção de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom! Se você é um profissional da área, sugiro começar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estratégias e tomadas de decisão. Pois como diz a famosa música de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por aí, ""hoje é um novo dia, de um novo tempo que começou.

Leah Matthews,0,,,"GPT-4 is here.There's no denying that AI software has cause quite the stir the past few months - especially with the likes of ChatGPT and Midjourney opening the door for the majority to consume (but we'll come to those issues another time).The truth of the matter is that AI is here to stay and it's getting smarter. Whether you take advantage of it and apply it to your business, well, that's another matter entirely.So what can you expect from GPT-4 and why is this news?👉 For starters, GPT-4 has been trained to understand and answer a lot more complex questions than the previous GPT-3 we've all been familiar with.👉 It has a vastly improved output. One of the downfalls of GPT-3 was that it never really understood the text it was generating. GPT-4 goes a step further in that it better understands what you want of it and outputs at a more 'human-like' and nuanced level.👉 It has multimodal learning. Where GPT-3 could only understand text as an input, GPT-4 can be fed images, video and audio and respond with what it sees.👉 It is conversational. It has been designed to engage better in conversations and be much more fluid than it's predecessor.We will see GPT-4 rolled out in a lot of businesses over the next few weeks, some having already done so.What are your thoughts on AI?

Dr. Andree Bates,0,,,"A recent study, scheduled to be presented at an upcoming computer vision conference, demonstrates that#AIcan read#brainscansand re-create largely realistic versions of images a person has seen.As this technology develops, researchers say, it could have numerous applications, from exploring how various animal species perceive the world to perhaps one day recording human dreams and aiding communication in people with paralysis.Many labs have used AI to read brain scans and re-create images a subject has recently seen, such as human faces and photos of landscapes. The new study marks the first time an AI algorithm called Stable Diffusion, developed by a German group and publicly released in 2022, has been used to do this. Stable Diffusion is similar to other text-to-image “generative” AIs such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, which produce new images from text prompts after being trained on billions of images associated with text descriptions.Unlike previous efforts using AI algorithms to decipher brain scans, which had to be trained on large data sets, Stable Diffusion was able to get more out of less training for each participant by incorporating photo captions into the algorithm. It’s a novel approach that incorporates textual and visual information to “decipher the brain,” says Ariel Goldstein, a cognitive neuroscientist at Princeton University who was not involved with the work.",1 hour ago

Dr. Volker Meise,3,5 comments,,"""Disruptive"", ""insane"", ""mindblowing"" - immer, wenn neue Technologie so beschrieben wird, bin ich skeptisch. Nicht so bei#GTP-4 , der neuen Version des KI-Modells u.a. hinter#ChatGPT- denn die Auswirkungen sind kaum zu überschätzen. Hier die wichtigsten Fakten, warum.💪 Mehr Parameter: GPT-4 kann noch mehr Daten verarbeiten und komplexere Texte generieren als GPT-3, denn GPT-4 hat 170 Billionen Parameter im Vergleich zu 175 Milliarden von GPT-3.💪 Größere Trainingsmenge: GPT-4 wurde mit 45 GB Trainingsdaten angelernt, während bei GPT-3 nur 17 GB verwendet wurden. Dadurch hat GPT-4 hat mehr Wissen, versteht Kontext besser und macht weniger Fehler.💪 Bilder als Input: GPT-4 akzeptiert Bilder als Eingabe, versteht deren Inhalt und kann daraus Beschriftungen, Klassifizierungen und Analysen erzeugen (""multimodal"").Insgesamt ist GPT-4 in der Lage, Texte mit größerer Kohärenz und Natürlichkeit zu erzeugen als GPT-3. Es kann Aufgaben erledigen, die Textverständnis und Zusammenhänge erfordern - wie z.B. Zusammenfassungen. Und das war schon beim alten ChatGPT beeindruckend zu erleben.Die Auswirkungen werden weitreichend sein:⭐ Beratung und Forschung reloaded: Schon jetzt ist GPT-4 beeindruckend gut darin, komplexe Zusammenhänge zu verstehen und neu zu sortieren, etwa die Zusammensetzung von Medikamenten zu erkennen und Alternativen vorzuschlagen. Wird es mit Spezialdaten trainiert (bspw. allen wissenschaftlichen Artikeln eines Fachgebietes), können in kürzester Zeit Analysen erstellt werden, die früher aufgrund des Aufwands sehr lange gedauert haben oder gar nicht erst in Angriff genommen wurden.⭐ Call-Center werden den Weg der Zeitungen gehen: Sie werden komplett digital oder zur Nische, denn die Mensch-Maschine Kommunikation springt auf ein neues Level. Bisher musste man bei Chatbots mögliche Antworten der Nutzer:innen voraussehen, um sinnvolle Antworten bereitzuhalten. GPT-4 versteht auch komplexe Fragen und erzeugt realistische Antworten - die dann als Text oder (KI-generiert) in natürlicher Sprache ausgegeben werden.⭐ Wir werden unseren Augen nicht mehr trauen können: KI-basierte Dienste wie DALL-E, Midjourney oder Stable Diffusion sind bereits jetzt extrem gut in der Erzeugung von realistischen Fotos auf der Basis von Textbeschreibungen. Mit realen Fotos trainiert, können neue Bilder einer Person mit beliebigen Gesichtsausdrücken in frei wählbarer Umgebung generiert werden. Kleiner Nebeneffekt: Stockfoto-Portale werden überflüssig.⭐ Alte Fähigkeiten werden wertlos, neue Fertigkeiten sind gefragt: Einfache Texte schreiben oder simplen Programmcode erstellen? Das kann die Maschine ab jetzt besser und schneller. In Zukunft braucht es Fähigkeiten, die KI-Tools so zu steuern, dass das gewünschte Ergebnis herauskommt (""prompt engineering"").Kurz: ""Mindblowing"". Und ich bin mir sicher, dass noch längst nicht alles ist. Da kommt noch mehr.https://lnkd.in/emttWY-J#GPT4#ChatGPT#KI#AI#Disruption#digitaleTransformation",1 hour ago

La campagne met en vedette plusieurs œuvres célèbres telles Le cri de Munch, Le naufrage de JMW Turner et La fille à la boucle d'oreille de Vermeer, ainsi que des œuvres d'artistes émergents du monde entier. 🌐Le principe est connu : il rappelle les tableaux de Poudlard du monde d’Harry Potter qui interagissent les uns avec les autres ou La nuit au musée avec Ben Stiller.Pour réaliser cette publicité Blitzworks, l’agence derrière la campagne, a fait appel à de ""l'IA de pointe"", selon Ajab Samrai, le CCO mondial.

O lo que es lo mismo: aprender a ser#promptdeveloper, un profesional cuyo cometido es hacer las preguntas y dar las indicaciones precisas (#prompts) para guiar a la IA en la generación ágil de contenido coherente y relevante.Cuando esta#tecnologíasea una ""commodity"" y tengamos normalizado su uso, el matiz que nos diferenciará de nuestra competencia será la calidad de esas indicaciones y preguntas. Ellas definirán el valor y la originalidad de nuestro contenido.Los profesionales de la comunicación, el periodismo y el marketing tenemos especial habilidad para sonsacar información y encadenar respuestas y preguntas. Por tanto, disponemos de un terreno bien abonado para ser ""prompt developers""😁. Solo tenemos que adaptarnos a un nuevo interlocutor y compañero.Y después, una vez hayamos aparcado la IA, debemos poner la guinda final como creadores de contenido.

Y tampoco un artículo para una revista científica que una entrada de blog.🖊 No pidas todo el contenido de una tacada: en el caso de un artículo, por ejemplo, puedes empezar solicitando el título y secciones (H2) y después ir encadenando indicaciones para la introducción, desarrollo de cada punto, el SEO, nuevas opciones de títulos, inclusión de fuentes o reducción de la extensión.👀: es posible que ChatGPT interrumpa la generación de contenido de forma repentina.

Like this one:https://lnkd.in/dxcq3hUG⚙️Code filled blog post that's checked by our devs - similar to usual blog post writing but with code.📩Emails to potential React Norway sponsors - outreach emails in a creative and cheerful voice to potential sponsors of RN.💡Quick POC proof-of-concept for an imaginary car brand eCommerce store - This will blow your mind.Midjourneyfor images, ChatGPT for imaginary car🚗/product📦 descriptions, free#ecommerceboilerplate fromCrystallizefor a quick storefront (we'll have a Livestream about this)📝Outlines for future posts/video - Instead of doing keyword research on a topic, then checking results, then proposing TITLE, then share it with the dev on task, etc., just add keyword/s of interest and require an article/post/or even video outline.Fist result is 30% more productive with the use of ChatGPT📈Seriously. It took care of mundane tasks and provided me with enough inspiration so I could pick where to go from there. Also, it helped me see if I missed a concept and choose and alter the output the way I want it.That is its power🤖The other side of the ChatGPT coin🪙is that if you don't know about the subject enough, you can neither acknowledge nor confirm if the writing is OK.And that can bite you on the back i.e., G might (and eventually it will) degrade your authority and expertise in a field, hurting your ranking, for example.And now#gpt4is herehttps://lnkd.in/du4jwDwTThe output is definitely much better (tested it both on the same subject and 4 seems to be much more mature in the way it builds sentences).Even though people are already building amazing stuff, let's wait for a few days to find proper use cases for it.The point is AI🤖is not going to replace what you do. It is a tool that can help you be better at what you do.As for the results of my experiments...will post them asap.Oh, and check the comments for some cool links.

Ismail Bicer,5,,1 repost,"(english part below)Salut ! 👋Aujourd'hui, c'est le GRAND jour. Cela fait quelques semaines (mois en vérité) que je travaille sur un petit projet. Le but ? Faire 3 affiches de film dit ""imaginaire"" avec des vieux assets 3D que j'avais ainsi que des images générées par Midjourney. La particularité de ce projet est que tout est réalisé sur After Effects. La première question serait, pourquoi n'ai-je pas utilisé Photoshop qui est quand même un logiciel dédié à la création de ce genre de chose. 💻La réponse est assez simple, les plugins. Certes, je n'aurai pas un traitement de l'image aussi poussé que sur Photoshop, mais les plugins et la fonctionnalité procédurale de ceux-ci me permette vraiment de me démarquer. 🎞Alors, oui j'ai utilisé Photoshop, mais dans le seul but de détourner mes personnes, c'est tout ! Je ferai très probablement un breakdown de comment j'ai fait tout ça. 🖼J'attends vos retours ! N'hésitez surtout pas à faire vos critiques ! 😋(CECI EST UN PROJET PERSONNEL)-Hi! 👋Today is the DAY. For some weeks now (months actually) I'm working on a little project. The goal? To create 3 posters of ""imaginary"" movies with some old 3D assets and images created using Midjourney. 💻Something's special with this project, everything has been mix up together using After Effects. The first question would be, what the hell I didn't use Photoshop, when it's the best software to do things like that! 🎞The answer is pretty simple, plugins. Certainly I'd not get the image treatment as pushed as Photoshop does but, the plugins and procedural functionalities of After Effects really gives this incredible and special looks.So yes, I still used Photoshop but only to cut out my characters, that's all! I will probably make a breakdown about how I made that. 🖼Looking forward for your reactions!

"Markus Auer, CFA",3,2 comments,,"🤯 I am sick of AI showcases 🤯GPT-4, Google WS Integration, etc... the flood of AI propaganda is endless and it is time we stop and think.Look, I love AI tools. 50% of the code (GitHub Copilot) and most of the illustrations (Midjourney) I use were created by AI. It's an immense productivity booster, mostly because it's almost free (no company has found a way to monetize AI properly, so don't expect this to continue). However, using a picture of notes on a napkin to code a website is nothing more than a neat magic trick to wow people with no dev experience, i.e. ""Look, you too can become a programmer with only a napkin and a pen.""Sticking to the example of the napkin - it is easy to find boiler plate solutions on the web to kickstart you project, the hard part is aligning your code infrastructure with the business case you choose to pursue. Overreliance on AI might lead to projects that are functionally sound, but economically disastrous. Lowcode/nocode are the most unintentionally dangerous trends in software right now.Then there's also the classical AI workflow.User: ""Build X.""AI: ""Ok, here's X and a half page essay on X.""User: ""Make it more like Y.""AI: ""Ok, here's XY and ..."" (repeat 10x)Most people underestimated how much of a time sink this is. Before you know it, you have engaged in a four hour conversation with an AI on some minor detail in a code snippet for which you can find best practice examples on Stackoferflow in 10 min.In summary, working with AI tools is more productive, yes, but not to the extent that it makes people redundant and sometimes using AI can become cumbersome real fast.https://lnkd.in/dt-xg3AQ#ai#productivity#gpt4#nocode#business#infrastructure#software",2 hours ago

Сергей Соболев,1,,,"Запуск GPT-4: новая ступень эволюции ИИ.Ну вот и оно! OpenAI только что выпустили своё последнее творение, GPT-4, и это очередной шаг к настоящему ИИ! Чтобы не затягивать, вот ключевые отличия GPT-4 от его предшественника GPT-3.5:1. GPT-4 демонстрирует производительность на уровне человека в различных профессиональных и академических тестах. Например, результаты GPT-4 входят в 10% лучших на смоделированном экзамене на адвоката, тогда как GPT-3.5 входит в 10% худших.2. Другое ключевое отличие заключается в том, что GPT-4 более надежен и способен обрабатывать более тонкие и подробные инструкции, чем GPT-3.5. Для сравнения, GPT-3.5 был способен обрабатывать до 4 тысяч токенов (что около 16 тысяч знаков), тогда как объём обрабатываемой GPT-4 информации вырос в 8 раз, до 32 тысяч токенов. Это значит, что он способен запоминать историю взаимодействия большего объёма, чем его предшественник, и в том числе сможет писать полноценные большие статьи.3. GPT-4 также имеет возможность “понимать” изображения, тогда как GPT-3.5 был ограничен только текстом. Это означает, что GPT-4 может генерировать текст на основе входных данных, состоящих из текста и изображений. Тем не менее, следует отметить, что входные изображения по-прежнему являются предметом исследования и пока не доступны общественности.4. Наконец, GPT-4 имеет улучшенную достоверность и управляемость по сравнению с более ранними моделями GPT. Хотя он по-прежнему может делать ошибки, GPT-4 оценивается на 40% выше, чем последняя версия GPT-3.5, по внутренней состязательной оценке фактов. Кроме того, GPT-4 обладает большей управляемостью, позволяя разработчикам и пользователям настраивать стиль модели и задачу с помощью системных сообщений в заданных пределах.Нельзя сказать, что GPT-4 – это революция. Это не так. Но мультимодальность модели (способность не только “читать”, но и “видеть”) – это первый шаг к передаче ИИ всех 6 чувств человека (нужно будет добавить ещё слух, осязание, обоняние, равновесие), чтобы в итоге прийти к реальным человекоподобным роботам!#ии#новостиии#нейросети#ai#openai#chatgpt#aiart#midjourney",3 hours ago

Image SynthesisGoogle Drive Viewing/Download Link:https://lnkd.in/ecSQJ77yThis automotive artbook immerses you in a world of automotive design that never was in a reality parallel to our own.  A planet earth that experienced a series of key temporal divergences that sent 20th century history spinning out of alignment with ours.Through a cutting edge creative workflow harnessing A.I. generative image creation with Photoshop collaging, recomposition and lightroom image grading, I tell the stories of a rule breaking race team, the dark history of a spanish supercar marque, the sweat and grit of all-american auto-giants, the might of New-Japan’s automakers, the determination and will of plucky british risk takers and a phoenix alliance rising from ashes of a post-war German automotive collapseFor those interested in the creative process and how I used A.I. not as a lazy ‘button click’ replacement for creativity, but as a powerful workflow tool , I’ve added a breakdown of my workflow I used to create the images in the book!Every image in the book was created using Diffusion Model Image Synthesis.  This tech is already disrupting the way the art and design industries operate and it’s already sending shockwaves of excitement (and controversy) through both from the staggering pace of progress as well as the enormous potential it holds as a creative tool.I have spent six months exploring ways I can harness the power of A.I. in my own work as well as pushing the limits of what can be achieved with the current generation of A.I. image models.  This artbook is a result of that work and is an exploration of how generative A.I can be used as a powerful creative tool to create compelling designs and photorealistic visualisations that serve to augment storytelling creativity and unleash the imagination.I truly hope you enjoy my automotive art book and the stories with.  This has been an absolute labour of love and I could not be happier with the outcome.So. without further ado.I invite you to download/view and enjoyThe Cars of One World Overhttps://lnkd.in/ecSQJ77y#design#work#tech#automotive#creativity#storytelling#project#passionproject#personalproject#learninganddevelopment#team#stablediffusion#midjourney#aidesign#aiart#aiartcommunity#aiarchitecture#industrialdesign#automotivedesign",3 hours ago

Céline Vassy,4,8 comments,,"L'IA peut-elle être notre miroir en tant que créateur?C'est une question que je me pose suite à un commentaire deLaurent Vaissadeen réponse au mien.Midjourney aurait pu me rendre accroc si... Il réunit deux facteurs dopaminergisant:- la nouveauté (encore un peu, je ne maîtrise pas tous les libellés des prompt)- je ne suis pas graphiste et là, sous mes yeux esbaudis, s'étale ce que j'OSE appeler ma création.Je passe de Docteur Frankenstein à créatrice de BD... J'évite toutefois les kalanish* Et si l'IA devait être le reflet de notre âme, j'avoue que je me tirerais illico de ce site de peur de prendre une balle.Assurément certains donnent libre cours à leur fantasme.D'ailleurs l'IA part du principe que l'être humain n'est que fantasmes.Je demande une femme brune sans précision d'âge ou de morphologie et j'obtiens une poupée siliconée.Et finalement, je m'aperçois assez vite que c'est toujours la même chose au fond.En réalité, l'IA manque d'imagination.Elle compile à toute vitesse des données, mais sa programmation repose sur les mêmes concepts.Elle évolue certes, mais sans parvenir à touche la quintessence de l'homme.Je ne vais pas parler d'âme mais d'émotion.Nos émotions créent nos souvenirs, ces souvenirs formeront des associations, des réseaux de neurones. Nous n'avons conscience  que de 0.26% de nos processus mentaux.Chaque seconde notre cerveau traite 400 milliards de bits d'informations.Seulement 2000 bits d'informations/sec seront portées à notre conscience.Nous sommes vraiment de formidables ""machines"" pas facilement copiables.Quand Google a voulu crée Bert en référencement, il a dû travailler sur la compréhension des requêtes pour que les mots soient compris dans leur contexte, résoudre la coréférence,  avec une possibilité de lecture de droite à gauche ou inversement.  Et la compréhension du sentiment qui se dégage d'un texte.Cette compréhension du sentiment lui permet de classer en signal positif, négatif ou neutre.On voit la difficulté de comprendre les signaux pour une IA.Cette incapacité à créer des associations reposant sur une réelle compréhension des sentiments humains pose la base d'une autre définition de la créativité.Nous pouvons adopter celle-ci pour forger l'avenir de nos enfants sur une performance technique, avec une valeur émotionnelle classée sur positif, négatif, ou neutre.Dès lors, les questions d'usage deviendront:-comment tu vas ce matin?-je suis neutre.-moi aussi.-Et ta vignette pour ta voiture? Elle est quelle couleur?- rouge. Je suis resté chez moi.Un monde où nos déplacements seront régis par des codes couleurs et nos sentiments en neutre, positif ou négatif.Mais on peut toujours programmer notre mort émotionnelle en se ruant sur l'IA. Le miroir de l'IA s'imposera à nous et non l'inverse.Imagine.... plus besoin de coach pour travailler sur tes blocages émotionnels puisque t'auras plus d'émotions 😍Et plus d'imagination.#neurosciences#IA##avenir",3 hours ago

Ben Panther,4,2 comments,,"Events schaffen sich ab...... wenn sie weiterhin nur auf Revenue, Abspulen von vorhersehbaren Inhalten und ""das haben wir schon immer so gemacht"" basieren.In den letzten Jahren haben viele Menschen das Gefühl, dass Social Media zu viel Zeit und Energie in ihrem Leben einnimmt. Einige sind besorgt über die Auswirkungen von Social Media auf ihre psychische Gesundheit, während andere einfach nur müde sind von der Fülle an Informationen und der permanenten Erreichbarkeit. Auch haben die Menschen einfach keine Lust mehr auf Fake-News, negative Kommentare und Verschwörungstheorien (Und NEIN, darüber diskutieren wir hier nicht). Das Resultat ist aber, dass viele ihre Nutzung einzuschränken oder komplett  beenden. Gleichzetig bedeutet das nicht, dass das Bedürfnis nach sozialer Interaktion oder Gemeinschaft verschwunden ist. Im Gegenteil, es hat sich nur verändert. Gerade wenn Social-Media weniger relevant ist und die Menschen erkennen, dass es eigentlich Bullshit ist, was da Online den ganzen Tag passiert, werden Events immer wichtiger.Events bieten die Möglichkeit, Menschen in einer realen Umgebung zu treffen und Zeit miteinander zu verbringen. Ob Konferenz,  Konzert, ein Essen oder eine Business-Festival ist dabei aus dieser Perspektive zweitrangig: Es ist eine Gelegenheit für Menschen, sich zu verbinden, zu lernen, sich zu amüsieren und einfach Spaß zu haben.Psychologisch relevant ist hier der Aspekt, dass Events um ein gemeinsames Interesse oder Thema herum veranstaltet werden. Das bedeutet, dass die Teilnehmer automatisch eine Gemeinschaft von Menschen mit ähnlichen Interessen oder Leidenschaften finden.Menschen streben nach Gemeinschaft und menschlicher Verbindung. Diese grundlegenden menschlichen Bedürfnisse, verschwinden auch in der digitalen Welt nicht. Und gerade in einer Welt, in der Inhalte, Bilder, Creatives und Texte von KI´s wie ChatGPT und Midjourney generiert werden. Gerade JETZT  ist es essenziell, den Menschen in den Mittelpunkt zu stellen und Gemeinschaft zu inszenieren, Menschen zusammenzubringen. Denn Online immer austauschbarer.Außerdem bieten Events die Möglichkeit, neue Menschen kennenzulernen und Beziehungen aufzubauen. Diese Beziehungen können in der digitalen Welt fortgesetzt werden, aber das Treffen von Menschen im wirklichen Leben schafft eine Verbindung, die anders ist als diejenige, die durch Online-Interaktionen entsteht. Und diese gemeinsamen Erlebnisse schaffen einzigartige Bindungen und Erinnerungen, die online schwer nachzubilden sind.Das Bedürfnis nach sozialer Interaktion und Gemeinschaft wird  weiterhin bestehen, unabhängig davon, wie sehr sich die Welt digitalisiert, wieviele neue KI-Tools entstehen. Der Mensch erkennt, dass Social Media nicht nur gut ist - wir starten also in die nächste Epoche.Also: Lasst uns Events kreieren, die Menschen zusammenzubringen und Menschen aufladen!",4 hours ago

Vadym Kuzmenko 👨🏻‍💻,10,1 comment,,"One skill that could make you the most desired hire in 2023 🔥“This position is a bit hard to hire for”, writesAnthropicin its job advertisement, offering up to whopping 335.000 dollars per year. 💰 Who are they looking to hire? A prompt engineer - the profession of the future.What do prompt engineers do? 👩‍🔬Prompt engineers design effective prompts (inputs) that instruct Generative AI to produce desired responses of high quality. It involves defining the context, setting goals, selecting relevant datasets, and fine-tuning parameters to optimize the output. Basically, you manipulate what a Large Language Model does, instead of training your own (which is costly, believe me).Is there a demand for prompt engineers? 🤔#AIis currently a very hot topic, so it’s only natural that individuals who can make the most of AI tools are much in demand. To put this into perspective: “prompt engineering” searches on Google rose more than 5000% in the last few months! I also see more and more job offerings for prompt engineers arising, tempting with attractive salaries. So while most people just play around with ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney etc., some make it their career path. What is special is that it’s not limited to any field - be it#marketing,#salesor even#legal.What skills do I need to become a prompt engineer? ⚒Good news: you don’t necessarily have to be a data scientist. Or a software developer. All you need is to think analytically and creatively! And to be patient enough to go through hundreds of iterations to get to a desired solid prompt, of course.How can I learn#promptengineering? 📚Well, it’s a trial-and-error game. I would argue that one develops some kind of intuition about what a good prompt looks like. But there is also a growing number of different resources where you can read about how to write high-quality prompts. I’ll make sure to share my top 10 later.Do you agree that this could be the hottest job of 2023? Would you apply for a position atAnthropic? And would you like to learn more about effective prompting?_________________________AtLegal OS, we have prompt engineering tasks on a daily basis. I will be sharing much more on this topic (including my own free#PromptGuide), so hit that follow button and stay tuned!",4 hours ago

Marilyn van der Meulen - Rahajaän,1,,,"Tips & tools om de mooiste beelden met AI te maken"" Dall-E, Midjourney en Dream zijn een aantal tools die je helpen om met AI de mooiste beelden te maken. Zonder dat er een fysieke camera of beeldbewerkingsprogramma nodig is. Deze tools bieden een ongekende creatieve vrijheid, maar soms kan het toch lastig zijn om hiermee ‘het perfecte plaatje’ te creëren.Als je ermee aan de slag gaat zal je versteld staan van het gemak waarmee een beeld gemaakt kan worden. En als je het een tijdje gebruikt zal je ook achter de beperkingen ervan komen. De afgelopen periode heb ik veel kennis en ervaring opgedaan om ‘het perfecte plaatje’ met AI te kunnen maken. In dit artikel deel ik deze ervaringen en geef ik je een lijst van tools die je kunt gebruiken, zodat jij dit ook kunt doen.""-Frankwatching#ai#tips#tools#onlinemarketing#content#onlinemarketingtips#frankwatching",4 hours ago

You can tell it exactly what you want in simple English, or even give it something more abstract to have a crack at, such as#IntelligentGrowth(see pic 7).Below is a gallery of some unedited outputs from MidJourney. Some of them were given one-word prompts, others were given entire paragraphs. It never failed to deliver!I am amazed with these results. In just one hour with no prior experience, I was able to create an impressive art portfolio which would take even the most highly-skilled human weeks!

L'art du ""prompt"" (le texte que l'utilisateur rentre pour indiquer à l'IA quel genre de texte ou d'image il attend) est en phase de devenir déterminant.

Zadajemy pytanie, a AI na nie odpowiada. Jak w filmach.Jednak, im dłużej się z niego korzystało, tym mocniej widziało się pewne ułomności. Wersja 4.0 ma to zmienić:▶  najnowsza wersja jest wielomodalna czyli będzie odpowiadać NIE TYLKO na nasze pisane pytanie ALE RÓWNIEŻ będzie wchodzić w interakcję z podawanymi mu zdjęciami i filmami (nie wiesz jaki gra aktor w filmie? robisz screena i wrzucasz do ChatGPT)▶  chcesz by z twoich danych została wygenerowana tabelka? Bardzo proszę.▶ w poniższym filmie mamy dowód jak wspaniałe jest to narzędzie, otóż facet w swoim notatniku narysował stronę (joke website) jak mniej więcej ma wyglądać, następnie zrobił zdjęcie tego szkicu i wrzucił do najnowszego ChatGPT, który mu zaprogramował dokładnie taką stronę. Mind-blow.▶ podobnie jak programy#MidJourneyczy#Dall-E, może również tworzyć grafiki czy obrazy po opisaniu. Nie jest to tak perfekcyjne jak we wspomnianych wcześniej programach, ale wg mnie to znowu, kwestia czasu▶  co więcej, w ten sam sposób będzie wstanie tworzyć video▶  najnowsza wersja wie co to sarkazm (wcześniej sprawiało mu to spory problem), rozumie kontekst, może nawet tłumaczyć memy▶#GPT4może spokojnie zdawać na studia.

Sepehr Safari,1,,,"In the previous posts, I talked about the importance of privacy and security in social media platforms, and how the#Nostrprotocol is addressing these issues with its decentralized and censorship-resistant backend.Now, let's explore the potential of Nostr protocol and how it can revolutionize the way we communicate and interact online.One of the key benefits of Nostr protocol is its decentralized nature, which means that there is no central authority controlling the network. This makes it more resilient to attacks and censorship, as there is no single point of failure. Additionally, Nostr protocol enables users to own and control their data, which is a fundamental aspect of privacy and security.Another exciting feature of Nostr protocol is its integration with the#Bitcoin#LightningNetwork over ZAP, which allows for fast and low-cost transactions. This opens up possibilities for#micropaymentsand peer-to-peer commerce on social media platforms, creating new opportunities for content creators and businesses alike.But the potential of Nostr protocol doesn't stop there. As more developers and users join the network, we can expect to see new and innovative use cases, such as decentralized marketplaces, social networks, messaging platforms, and even real-time collaboration tools. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to be a part of this growing community.Stay tuned for my next post, where I'll introduce Nostribe, my#opensourceweb client built on top of the Nostr protocol.PS: image generated with Midjourney.",5 hours ago

VR wykorzystywany jest zarówno w celach czysto rozrywkowych, ale również zawodowych, biznesowych.Bez trudu znajdziemy salony gier, gdzie przy pomocy gogli możemy wcielić się w kosmicznego marines i obronić ziemię przed inwazją kosmicznych robaków.Możemy odbyć szkolenie, gdzie dzięki tej technologii nauczymy się obsługi wózka widłowego, przygotowania smażonych kotletów w bułce, nakładania tynków, czy pierwszej pomocy.Czy też wreszcie, możemy odbyć wirtualne spacery po projektowanej, przyszłej inwestycji lub po historycznych, nieistniejących już obiektach.To tylko kilka z wielu przykładów.◾ Zastanawiam się czy mieliście okazję wypróbować tę technologię? Jeśli nie, czy chcielibyście? Jakie macie wrażenia?◾ W jaki sposób wykorzystywana jest w waszej branży? A jeśli nie, czy macie pomysł w jaki sposób mogłaby zostać użyta?◾ Czy waszym zdaniem jest to tylko chwilowa moda, a niedługo zapomnimy o tym, podobnie jak o telewizorach 3D? Czy może tym razem VR zostanie z nami na dłużej?Chętnie poznam waszą opinię w tym temacie, przeczytam o waszych doświadczeniach 😉//ilustracja Midjourney, AI generated",5 hours ago

There are examples of artists — such as Refik Anadol — who are the actual creators, but use artificial intelligence to augment their artworks.

Sree Vandana Bendalam,5,,,"“…like liquid imagination flowing around the room”— David Holz, founder of MidJourneyI am pleased to share my reflections on the midterm review of our Performance + Computation Studio project, which focuses on the use of artificial intelligence in architectural design. Our project, led by ProfessorYun Kyu Yi, aims to investigate how AI can enhance and expand our creativity in the design process.The review provided us with an excellent opportunity to present our preliminary findings and ideas to a distinguished panel of critics. Their feedback and insights were helpful in refining our approach as we continue to investigate the intersection of AI and architecture.One of the key takeaways from the review was the importance of balancing AI's role in the design process with architects' human creativity and intuition. While AI can help us generate and evaluate design options more quickly and efficiently, it cannot replace the unique perspective and touch that each architect brings to the table.I am grateful to the critics for their insightful comments, as well as to our school's director, ProfessorFrancisco J. Rodríguez-Suárez, FAIA, for his unwavering support. I am excited to continue working with my teamChawin WongsrisoontornandRuimin Duto push the boundaries of what AI and architectural design are capable of, as well as to explore the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.#architecture#architect#design#architects#team#ai#architecturaldesign#project#artificialintelligence#creativity",5 hours ago

Sean Macfaden,22,,,"Had a first foray into Midjourney last night and was surprised at the outcome.My input was 'a front 3/4 sketch of a yellow cb400ss brat tracker with black wire wheels and a wrapped exhaust pipe'.I chose this as a little challenge to the AI, to see if it even recognised the model I was referencing, and to see if it could differentiate the components enough to be truly legible. In the 3 images I've posted, I'll let you decide if that's the case....What I was impressed with was: firstly the pace, can't deny it's speed to produce multiple images. Secondly, the 'artistry' of the fake hand drawn images. There is a beauty and balance in the composition that really shocked me. Something I could spend hours poring over has been made instantaneous. I started with the 4 more individual images, put a round of variations based on one of them, then proceeded to upscale it to the final image.I say final - it's fine as art (or an underlay) - but not as design in its current form. Proportionally it's okay but lines are inconsistent, the wheels are bagels, the forks are bowed etc. I'm excited to see how I can use AIs like midjourney to enhance the images I create or give me inspiration for setting up my own renders - exciting times!(I agree with sentiments i've seen shared on here though that there is still a MASSIVE part for the user in shaping the journey of these images through the right prompts, and recognising potential in them)#ai#art#design?",5 hours ago
