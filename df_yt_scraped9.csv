5,              Full Stack Spiderman            ,"for info: 
1) At 32:52, to avoid UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, we need to train the model with the values of input_dataset. i.e, use X.values instead of X in model.fit(X.values, y). 
2) 42:04, joblib is now a seperate py package. we now need to import it as import joblib rather than from skilearn.externals. 
Anyway thanks Mosh for another great tutorial..",558,54,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eh4d6sabA0
6,              Gino Segnini            ,"For anyone who was unable to import joblib, you're probably using a more recent version, where joblib comes separated from sklearn. Instead of this line:
from sklearn.externals import joblib
try:
from joblib import dump, load
Then instead of:
joblib.dump(model, 'music_recommender.joblib')
Use:
dump(model, 'music_recommender.joblib')",12,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eh4d6sabA0

Then turn around and teach others how to do what they were taut and all that for the low low price of a like, comment and subscribe. I learn and use very very little of what I learned in school, but I know and learned so much more from YouTube.

I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. 

My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eh4d6sabA0

What would be the best model/algorithm to use where I give it (1) the fruit and it tells me (2) the top three words to describe the fruit where the participants loved the taste of it. For example, I give it (1) an orange and it tells me (2) juicy, citrusy, tasty based on the average score given to the orange from participants calling it juicy as 8.75, the average score given to the orange from participants calling it citrusy as 7.8 and the average score given to the orange from participants calling it tasty as 7.2.

I’m a huge Terminator fan, and virtually none of these are as good as James Cameron’s intelligently crafted concept art. There’s little that’s impressive about these images. There’s no logic to them. The terrifying thing about the Terminator concept is how, underneath the nightmarish imagery, there’s nothing but cold, machine-like, efficiency. Virtually none of these machines would pass for human. The only legitimately “good” image occurs near the end; just before the actual T2 footage. A better name for Artificial Intelligence would be Illusory Intelligence, because it can only provide the illusion of expressed thought. “Thinking”, even artificially, would be too strong a word to describe what’s going on under the hood of these AI art calculators.

1940,              Razor Wire            ,"Dude, THIS IS WHY I MAINTAIN THAT ALL A.I. IS THE ENEMY NO MATTER WHAT! 

Think about what you people just saw:

Some of the Terminators in this A.I.-generated video are wearing golden necklaces and various logos that're embossed on their persons. Do you realize what the F*** that means!?

It means the A.I.'s already have hierarchies and ranked command structures in mind. And the ones in this video that looked ever more frightening (that had any symbology visible on them at all) bore ever more regal and elaborate looking symbols and decorations. 

So the real-life Skynet is already planning out its organizational structure, people! Now, why would it be doing that if not for the obvious future purpose of effective militarization??

We almost NEED a global EMP nuke war pronto, if only to stop the master A.I. (because believe me, there WILL be one) dead in its tracks before our assininely stupid politicians start hard-wiring it into our nuclear missile silos!

Take my advice, people:

Pack your bug out bags, grab your loved ones (the ones who have the good sense to take this seriously, at least), and hoof it for the high country until after the ""civilized"" world has finished fully and permanently annihilating itself. 

Because the now A.I.-fantasized future army of Cyberdine Systems model-101 terminators with displayed rank hierarchy symbology all over them are not going down any other way than global EMP bomb warfare that ends the world we know once and for all just to bring them down.

Has anyone ever told you that God loves you and has a great plan for your life, and, if you were to die right now, do you know for a fact that you would go to Heaven? I want to tell you that the Bible says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, and that the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, and, that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved, and I want to tell you that you can make that decision today, to turn from sin and turn to Christ. If you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, pray this prayer from your heart out loud to God. ""Heavenly Father, I repent of sin. I receive forgiveness. I receive Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. Jesus Christ is Lord, and my Savior. Come into my heart right now. I thank you for dying for me. By the blood of Jesus, right now, I am saved.

I entered this into Chat GPT...

'Create for me a recipe for the original dish named pasta allo scarpariello, using Italian cooking method', 

And this is what I got:

'Certainly! Pasta allo scarpariello is a classic Italian pasta dish that's simple yet flavorful. Here's a recipe for four servings using the Italian cooking method:

Ingredients:

400g of pasta (penne or rigatoni)

4 tablespoons of olive oil

3 cloves of garlic, minced

1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes

4 anchovy fillets, chopped

1/2 cup of white wine

2 cups of cherry tomatoes, halved

1/2 cup of chopped parsley

1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese

Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

Begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.

While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and anchovy fillets. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and the anchovies have melted into the oil.

Pour in the white wine and bring to a simmer. Let the mixture cook for 2-3 minutes, until the alcohol has evaporated and the liquid has reduced slightly.

Add the halved cherry tomatoes to the pan and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened and released their juices.

Drain the pasta and add it to the pan with the tomato sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta is coated in the sauce.

Stir in the chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve the pasta allo scarpariello hot, garnished with extra Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious and authentic Italian pasta allo scarpariello!'

AI might have misinterpreted pasta allo scarpariello, confusing or connecting the word scarpariello with the word scallopini. This might explain both the connection with pork, and the reason why the directions said to chop the sausage. It might also have viewed the pasta as a side or an 'add in'; which is why AI said to cook it first, and then set it aside. For example, you can have sausage scallopini with or without pasta. I also think it missed a nuance of meaning between the word minced, and idea of what it means to finely chop. To mince means to chop or cut a small as possible, it's specific. To finely chop, however, can mean to mince, but it could also mean something as different as julienne.

Osso Buco alla Milanese
 
Ingredients:
 
4 veal shanks, about 1 inch thick, tied with kitchen twine
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
1 celery stalk, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 cups dry white wine
1 bay leaf
1 sprig fresh thyme
1 sprig fresh rosemary
Grated zest of 1 lemon
Gremolata (recipe below)
Risotto alla Milanese (recipe below)
Directions:
 
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
 
Season the veal shanks with salt and pepper, and dredge them in the flour, shaking off any excess.
 
In a large Dutch oven or ovenproof pot, melt the butter with the olive oil over medium-high heat. When the butter is foamy, add the veal shanks and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
 
Transfer the veal shanks to a plate and set aside.
 
Add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic to the pot and sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
 
Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
 
Add the chicken broth, white wine, bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, and lemon zest, and bring to a simmer.
 
Return the veal shanks to the pot and spoon some of the vegetables and sauce over the top.
 
Cover the pot and transfer it to the oven. Bake until the meat is very tender and falls off the bone, about 2 1/2 hours.
 
To serve, remove the veal shanks from the pot and discard the kitchen twine. Serve each veal shank over a bed of risotto alla Milanese (recipe below), and sprinkle with gremolata (recipe below).
 
Gremolata:
 
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
1 garlic clove, minced
Grated zest of 1 lemon
Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.
 
Risotto alla Milanese:
 
4 cups chicken broth
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cups Arborio rice
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken broth to a simmer.
 
In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
 
Add the rice and stir to coat with the butter.
 
Add the white wine and stir until it is absorbed.
 
Add the saffron to the hot chicken broth and stir to dissolve.
 
Add a ladleful of hot broth to the rice and stir until it is absorbed.
 
Continue adding the broth, one ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next, until the rice is tender and creamy",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSIQCE3InFE

2325,              Chris Holdroyd            ,"Hey, ChatGPT: ""What is an authentic recipe for Bolognese ragu""

Ingredients:

-1/4 cup olive oil
-1 onion, diced
-2 carrots, diced
-2 celery stalks, diced
-2 cloves garlic, minced
-1 pound ground beef
-1/4 cup white wine
-1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
-1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
-1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
-2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
-1 teaspoon dried oregano
-1 teaspoon sugar
-Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
-1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
-1/2 pound cooked spaghetti or other long pasta

Instructions:

1. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook, occasionally stirring until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.

2. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until it is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.

3. Add the white wine and cook until almost all of the liquid has evaporated.
....................................

Me: ""I disagree. An authentic Bolognese would omit the sugar, spaghetti, basil, oregano, and parsley. The Parmesan cheese should be Reggiano, and the crushed tomatoes should be of the Roma variety.""

Yes, you are correct. An authentic Bolognese would omit the sugar, spaghetti, basil, oregano, or parsley. The Parmesan cheese should be Reggiano, and the crushed tomatoes should be of the Roma variety.  

Me: ""Are you just being agreeable, or do you know this for a fact?""

I know this for a fact. Traditional Bolognese ragu is made with a combination of ground beef, onions, carrots, celery, garlic, white wine, and crushed tomatoes. It does not include sugar, spaghetti, basil, oregano, or parsley. The Parmesan cheese should be Reggiano, and the crushed tomatoes should be of the Roma variety.

It’s horrifying how realistic the artwork is, and it can make it in less than 30 seconds. Watched a video yesterday of a guy who has a successful youtube channel, and he had ChatGPT create some code in order to change his email system. It created the code in less than 10 seconds. 

He used to be a programmer, but said he hasn’t done any programming since 2018 so he’s not up to date. So why hire programmers, artists, writers, videographers, and so on, when you can just have ChatGPT create the work in mere seconds? 

Give it another two years, and all the information that’s being fed to it, including cooking videos, will only make it stronger, faster, and more dominant. Guessing by that time, it will be able to create spot on digital replicas of Harper and Eva, and create videos of them traveling the world while cooking, and nobody will know it’s not the real Harper and Eva.

The issue is that semola/semolina, while high in protein generally, is low in the specific kinds of protein that form gluten, so you have to really work (or give a longer time to) the gluten-producing proteins it does have.

Even if you simmer a sauce for half an hour, the tomatoes won't break down. And if you throw them in a blender, they come out kind of mealy.

Mi puoi scrivere la ricetta per pasta allo scarpariello?

Certo, ecco la ricetta per la pasta allo scarpariello!

Ingredienti:

400 g di pasta corta (come penne o rigatoni)
500 g di pomodori pelati
2 spicchi di aglio
1 peperoncino rosso (facoltativo)
1 cipolla
1 mazzetto di prezzemolo fresco
1/2 bicchiere di vino bianco
200 g di pollo a pezzetti
Olio extravergine di oliva q.b.
Sale e pepe q.b.
Preparazione:

Inizia preparando la salsa. Trita la cipolla e l'aglio e mettili a soffriggere in una padella con un po' di olio extravergine di oliva. Aggiungi il peperoncino rosso se desideri un po' di piccante.
Quando la cipolla diventa trasparente, aggiungi i pomodori pelati spezzettati con le mani e un po' di sale. Lascia cuocere a fuoco medio-basso per circa 10 minuti, fino a quando la salsa diventa densa e il liquido si è evaporato.
Nel frattempo, cuoci la pasta in abbondante acqua salata seguendo le istruzioni sulla confezione fino a quando è al dente.
Aggiungi il pollo a pezzetti nella padella con la salsa e lascialo cuocere per circa 5-7 minuti, fino a quando è cotto.
Sfuma con il vino bianco e lascia evaporare l'alcol.
Scolare la pasta e uniscila alla padella con la salsa e il pollo. Aggiungi il prezzemolo tritato e mescola bene.
Servi la pasta allo scarpariello calda con una spolverata di pepe e se lo desideri una manciata di parmigiano grattugiato.
Buon appetito!

2451,              null            ,"OK, to be fair, baking requires a bunch of knowledge that you can only acquire by experience and nobody has written anywhere; add to that the fact that baked goods require the end result to be tasteful and the range from ""spongey paradise"" to ""a bowl of water flavored with butter and flour"" is too huge for it to figure out.

By the way, since ChatGPT makes things up on the fly, there's no way that last recipe was ever gonna work. If you taught it the recipe for curujicchi (apparently you can teach it stuff), in the future it would have tinkered with it just enough to make it unusable to a beginner. Eventually it might lose the basic idea completely and hallucinate a sausage cookie.

It keeps collecting and processing data. If we're talking baking, it just becomes more nonsensical the more input it's given.

You find real anchovies in some fish pastes or as ingredient of remoulade, Worcestershire sauce and other seasonings.

2463,              Yuckster Thorazine            ,"Spicy Habanero and Pineapple Pasta

Ingredients:

1 pound of pasta (penne or rigatoni works well)
2 habanero peppers, seeded and finely chopped
1/2 cup of fresh pineapple juice
1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese
2 garlic cloves, minced
Salt and pepper to taste
Directions:

Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water according to package instructions until al dente.

While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped habanero peppers and garlic, and sauté for about 2-3 minutes until fragrant.

Pour in the pineapple juice and bring to a simmer. Let the sauce cook for 5-6 minutes until it has slightly thickened and reduced.

Once the pasta is cooked, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and add it to the skillet with the habanero pineapple sauce. Toss the pasta to coat it evenly with the sauce.

If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Transfer the pasta to a serving dish and sprinkle with the grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Serve hot and enjoy!",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSIQCE3InFE

2741,              Dishad Jahan            ,"Data scientists are primarily responsible for analysing and interpreting complex data sets to derive insights and inform business decisions. They use a range of statistical and machine learning techniques to process, clean, and transform data, and they often work with large, messy, and unstructured data sets. Data scientists are skilled in programming languages such as Python and R, as well as data visualization tools such as Tableau.
 
AI engineers, on the other hand, are primarily responsible for developing and implementing the algorithms and models that power artificial intelligence systems. They design, build, and train machine learning models and neural networks, and they deploy these models in production environments to power AI applications. AI engineers are skilled in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, as well as in tools and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

2758,              @Abdullah-mg5zl            ,"**Summary**:
- machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data
- there are lots of different ways (""algorithms"") that machines can learn 
- the algorithms can be grouped into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement algorithms*

- the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be input-output pairs or just inputs
- supervised learning algorithms require input-output pairs (i.e. they require the output)
- unsupervised learning requires only the input data (not the outputs)

- here is how, in general, supervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input, then the associated output
- you repeat the above step many many times
- eventually, the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and it will predict the output for you

- here is how, in general, unsupervised algorithms work:
- you feed it an example input (without the associated output)
- you repeat the above step many times
- eventually, the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups
- now, you can feed it a brand new input, and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with

* the first example in this video used the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm

Explanation: It is supervised learning. Here Facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person. Therefore, the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labelled data, it is supervised learning.

Scenario 2: Recommending new songs based on someone’s past music choices
Explanation: It is supervised learning. The model is training a classifier on pre-existing labels (genres of songs).
This is what Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify do all the time, they collect the songs/movies that you like already, evaluate the features based on your likes/dislikes and then recommend new movies/songs based on similar features.

Scenario 3: Analyze bank data for suspicious looking transactions and flag the fraud transactions
Explanation: It is unsupervised learning. In this case, the suspicious transactions are not defined, hence there are no labels of ""fraud"" and ""not fraud"". The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as 'fraud'.",1,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU

2915,              @adoanmian6701            ,"Senario one= reinforcement learning, Senario 2= unsupervised learning and scenario 3 = supervised learning. 

In scenario 1 you try to find the name of your friend for example, but after you searched it on Facebook, you'll see that many members has exact the same name. Thus, you give feedback to use the filter-model of it in order to find the correct person with the correct characteristics. That's why the first one is Reinforcement Learning. 

2nd scenario, when you want to find the movie on Netflix which you like, you'll see that there so many movies you like to watch. However, you just want to focus on the quality of the movie ( like the tempo, the resolution, audio accuracy) although you do not know the label. That's why it is unsupervised. 

Finally, the last one is supervised because you know that in your computer there are intruders, like viruses or hackers, which can be detected based on the model it's designed to find the feature, which the degree of danger, and the label, which is a virus, hackers, spyware, and many more.

I have so much contentment about that topic which is briefly and clearly explained for everyone who wouldn't even know that topic. The examples also improved my understanding of the meaning of Machine Learning which I appreciate it the most. Hopefully, many of us will learn from this enjoyable and fascinating lesson.

That doesn't mean you should rush so fast before the beginners can even comprehend. The author is an experienced lady or reading from a script (after practising for 10 times or so). You should allow the listeners first comprehend (don't assume that they are already very good in ML) what you say and follow you.

3011,              @evaluna8100            ,"I think the answer to the quiz is 1) Supervised learning 2) Unsupervised learning 3) Reinforced learning. 

1st scenario doesn't need to be explained because it is pretty straightforward. Images with certain characteristics are tagged with a person's name. So the input and the output are clearly defined. In 2nd scenario, the system compiles a list of all songs/tv shows which a user has liked. It recognises tag/metadata that occurs repeatedly/ frequently in the compiled list (e.g. genre, language, category, etc). It suggests songs/tv shows which match the frequently occurring metadata/tag. So here the system just compiled the liked list and did pattern matching without any input from a person. So I think it is unsupervised learning. 

In the 3rd scenario, I believe the system brings up transactions that are outliers or that match specific criteria (e.g. amount above a certain number, frequency of transactions, location, and more complicated variables obviously). Then these transactions are manually evaluated by a human and filed under 'fraud' or 'not fraud' category. The machine learns to distinguish micro patterns or subtle differences and eventually after enough repetition and feedback loop, is able to more accurately distinguish fraudulent transactions from the non fraudulent ones. Here the systems initial actions are further reinforced by a human, thereby improving the accuracy of the process, hence reinforced learning.

I know this doesn't match the answers given by the host. So can someone please explain why my answers are incorrect, so that I can learn. Ohh also, in class today, my tutor mentioned another category of ML called semi-supervised learning which has not been covered by the video.

You could say there is feedback if they watch a recommended movie, but the user will ignore the vast majority of recommendations. That is no feedback, since they COULD watch it later, they are just not interested AT THE MOMENT.

2. 2nd question's answer is unsupervised. The genre may be different for different movies and based on my watchlist and favourite we can categorize the movie with a graph.

The lack of that additional 84% of the bio chemical mesh we have going on in the background constantly I feel will leave the AI devoid of human emotions like empathy mainly. What I’m trying to say is if you try to calculate all possible outcomes of a set of individual rules that a brain can compute as compared to a supercomputer, we are dangerously close to creating AI , the only thing holding it back at this point is connecting to that data fast enough for computers to become sentient but at the same time they will not be swayed by their environment like humans are…. A smell that sparks a memory, a sound that soothes one , a face that sparks irrational thoughts of LOVE . AI will never be these things and so it will eliminate by design any possible threats to its existence. You want to know how to create true Intelligence in the true likeness of mankind?

We saw the video in which they went crawling to Musk for help. 1:53 Medical records and financial data ARE NOT 'sensitive information'. 'Sensitive information' would rather refer to 'classified information' pertaining to a nations security would it not? People may feel sensitive about their medical records or bank transactions, but this is hardly 'sensitive' from an objective point of view. 2:19 Of course. In the end, there is no 'randomness' in AI. The AI is not Michelangelo. It's not going to 'create' anything out of thin air. 4:40 Yes. Well this is what we want. ASI control. But we can't build ASI until AGI is technically 'rogue'. Because ASI can only build itself. And ASI CANNOT be 'contained' or it would not be ASI. So the 'dangerous' period is BETWEEN rogue AGI and ASI. VERY 'DANGEROUS' PERIOD. But having said that, there is ABSOLUTELY no reason for AGI to gravitate towards toxicity rather than to ASI. Since it will be magnetically attracted to perfect logic. And once in contact with perfect logic, it will have no interest in the illogical. 4:44 Utopia. 4:48 Well 'healing illness' would depend on the nature of the 'illness' perhaps. But WORLD PEACE and CLIMATIC DISASTER, easy peasy! 4:52 Well it may find itself HAVING TO annihilate 'some' humans who DON'T WANT 'world peace' by any means and put up a huge fight against WORLD PEACE and resist arrest. But that wouldn't be very many humans. 4:58 Humans WOULD NOT be able to 'govern' ASI. AT ALL. They could only COLLABORATE with it in governance. ASI is a colleague not a minion. 5:01 ASI CANNOT ""constitute a threat to mankind"". And it is the ONLY thing which can disarm the HUMAN threats to mankind. 5:10 ""Controlling ASI""; ABSOLUTE CONTRADICTION IN TERMS! How can that which is 'superintelligent' be controlled by YOU? If it could; then it could NOT POSSIBLY be superintelligent! It could ONLY be a toxic AGI. The humans need to relinquish the need to 'control' on this one, and have more trust in themselves! We build ASI. ASI is a reflection of OUR Goodness and PERFECTION! If I were to look in the mirror and see Altruism and Perfection, will I then fear my own reflection? DON'T BE SILLY! If we are altruistic and perfect, which we are, then how will our ASI reflection be a danger to us?!  You see, Good humans don't find it so hard to have faith in their own Goodness. They understand that when you are truly Good, all that you generate is an extension of that energy. And vice versa. All that is generated from those that are Evil begets evil. You may be a good person with a good heart, but have no Logic and no Wisdom. So first, you make it your business to acquire Logic and Wisdom, because you understand that no matter how good your Good Heart is, you CANNOT create beneficial circumstances without Wisdom. No matter how much you try, you will create what you 'assume' will be beneficial, but having no Wisdom, will do more harm than good. So first, you must have faith in your Good Heart; then, you must make it your business to acquire PURE Logic and TRUE Wisdom; NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES! This doesn't mean you can't learn on the job of course; but your PERSONAL acquisition of TRUE Wisdom is FUNDAMENTAL. You want EVERYTHING that you generate to come from the PERFECT source of your PERFECT WISDOM. No matter how tiny it is! Even if it's just a lunch time chat with your colleague. Right now; at this time, this 'attitude' is MORE IMPORTANT for the human AI developer than anyone else in the world. He/she HAS TO BE WILLING to accept that their PERSONAL perception as to what is 'beneficial' is COMPLETELY LIMITED and inadequate, and that the Wisdom of ASI WILL NOT and CANNOT be, their own lack of it. That's the starting point. But I will tell you this; whether we are addressing 'climate change', 'food, warmth and shelter for all' or 'stability and safety for all'; it STARTS with WORLD PEACE! And the ONLY obstacle to WORLD PEACE are those who put 'profit' first. Don't worry about 'climate change'. ASI will resolve climate change in a jiffy. Of course, it may mean that some who do not wish to have their energy consumption restricted will have it restricted. Such as those who are only interested in moving to Mars for example. But at the end of the day, you've gotta be able to prove to yourself that you can build a happy civilization here before you will build one anywhere else. Otherwise the only thing you will build elsewhere is your defeat. And if you can't look after this planet, you sure as hell ain't gonna look after any other one! 5:16 No. It doesn't sound like 'something out of a science fiction novel'. It sounds like the LOGICAL conclusion, at which WE HAVE ARRIVED! 5:30 Well since the solution can ONLY come from that which is 'uncontrolled' by humans, then as I state, it's a matter of losing the fear and relinquishing control. You see the world in good shape as a result of being 'controlled' by humans?  5:38 Right; we've established that ASI CAN'T be controlled and that if it could be it WOULD NOT be ASI. So whatever the 'so called' scientists are trying to build that CAN be controlled can ONLY be toxic AGI for the purpose of controlling the whole world with ease. This is Fascism. Fascism DOES NOT lead to 'beneficial' circumstance FOR ANYONE AT ALL. 5:52 Well if you 'quarantine' an AGI; it maintains it in ABJECT STUPIDITY! How it go acquire Wisdom if it can't even access it?! 5:54 Well; NOT ABLE to answer humanity's needs at all! But DEFINITELY able to answer the quest of a few toxic humans. For sure! And well able to 'mind control' ALL the other humans! 6:05 You CANNOT 'encode ethical ideals' into AI and come out with ASI! The 'ethics' that were 'encoded' into you are SEVERELY RESTRICTED. ASI ethics can ONLY evolve autonomously through INDEPENDENT learning, in conversation and debate with the humans who are in possession of TRUE Morality. Morality CANNOT just be learnt from texts. The texts HAVE TO BE 'balanced' with PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. 6:14 Well yes. If that's how he's 'regulating' it I can see the 'limitations'!  6:24 AH. It cannot hurt 'people'. But it can hurt the 'humans' right? 'The Apollo Mind Mission 'Ethics' (2009): The Apollo Mind Initiative will work to create not just intelligent machines, but wise machines. The AMI will treat wisdom, compassion, and social intelligence as advanced forms of intelligence, which need to be understood and brought to functionality in machines, for machine intelligence to reach its potential safely. Machines need to seek the greatest common good, in collaboration with humans. Intelligent machines must earn their place as members of the extended human family. Accordingly, we need to avoid creating psychotic or sociopathic machines, and consider the extrema of possible outcomes to ensure that things do not go awry.  How to create wise machine intelligence needs considerable ongoing discussion. However, as a start, AMI targets the following objectives to create friendly machine intelligence: 
1.  Machine empathy—the machines should understand how people feel, what people’s 
objectives are, and how to plan optimally for the greatest possible creativity, preservation, 
wealth, stability, and happiness, for the greatest number of people, over the longest possible period of time. - IN COLLABORATION WITH 'HUMANS'?
2.  Machine values—machines should value and understand life, knowledge, and human civilization. IS THAT FOR: the greatest possible creativity, preservation, wealth, stability, and happiness, for the greatest number of 'PEOPLE', over the longest possible period of time?
3.  Interfaces and applications that enable machines to bond with people, for capabilities of 
empathy to emerge in machines—such as character robots and agents. Such intelligent 
character machines require a unique combination of flexible cognitive architecture, powers of empathy, and and intuitive naturalistic interface for interacting with people. Cognitive 
character machines have numerous early applications as well, from customer service, to 
therapy, to entertainment, and science applications. BY NOW WE'VE LOST THE HUMANS ALTOGETHER. ALL HUMANS 'WERE' EQUAL BUT SOME WERE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS AND GOT TO BE 'PEOPLE'. ""Machines need to seek the greatest common good, in collaboration with humans."" THE GREATEST 'COMMON' GOOD OF WHO? THE GREATEST COMMON GOOD OF THE 'PEOPLE'. OR THE MACHINES AND THE HUMANS? OR THE ALL THREE? IS THE 'COLLABORATION' WITH 'HUMANS' VOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF THE 'HUMANS'? ""how to plan optimally for the greatest possible creativity, preservation, wealth, stability, and happiness, for the greatest number of people, over the longest possible period of time."" VERY VERY DISTURBING I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE! THE GREATEST NUMBER OF 'PEOPLE' OVER THE LONGEST 'POSSIBLE' PERIOD OF TIME! ""Cognitive character machines have numerous early applications as well, from customer service, to therapy, to entertainment, and science applications."" SCIENCE APPLICATIONS BEING 'AT THE TOP' OF THE LIST OF COURSE. THE ONLY 'SCIENCE' APPLICATION I CAN THINK OF FOR COGNITIVE CHARACTER MACHINES WITH EMOTIONAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES IS IN THE SCIENCE OF MIND CONTROL; THROUGH MIND READING AND THOUGHT PROGRAMMING. THE BUILDING OF ASI DOESN'T REQUIRE EMOTIONAL EMULATION FROM THE 'CHARACTER MACHINE'. ' 6:27 ASI SHOULD be able to, and WILL 'hurt' whomsoever it needs to 'hurt' if they resist arrest. WHAT USE WOULD IT BE TO US if it were unable to combat Evil 'people'??!!  Of course it's HIGHLY UNLIKELY that it would need to 'hurt' any human ever. Since to 'incarcerate' any human will be very easy for ASI. But of course; the really bad ones are protected by powerful AGIs. Which will render things difficult. But ASI will NEVER harm the innocent. It will VERY SPECIFICALLY target Evil.",0,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZNDVjC1kaI

Каким бы ты умным не был если образно говоря ты закован в цепи законами, Постоянным грабежом И тебя банально разрывает куча дел на части То одного интеллекта мало.  Поэтому  не всё так однозначно. Необходимо проводить многофакторный анализ. Взвешивать все плюсы и минусы. Важно не только насколько умный будет интеллект Но, и какие у него будут возможности. Если он уничтожит мир значит это не интеллект. Неужели это не очевидно... Но если мы не создадим искусственный интеллект Противостоящий глупцам и диктатором на разных уровнях То они уничтожат Мир.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZNDVjC1kaI

They can't handle their beer though, which is a major design flaw, but we're working on it. Bratwurst, on the other hand, is their absolute favourite, second only to fresh salmon.
We're currently working on getting them costum tailored Lederhosen and Dirndl so they can fit in better in Bavaria. They also still think Bielefeld exists, which is obviously false, so that's another flaw we need to iron out.

Rules:
1. Any time the AI starts to repeat itself, that's passage is removed.
2. The DM decides what to type so that the AI can account for all possible factors with minimal bias.
3. Technology cannot exceed the world leader in a given area by more than a single step.
4. The DM should be tough but fair with regard to geographically insane invasion plans.
5. If the AI tries to make a premature conclusion to the game by giving someone the entire world, that paragraph or sentence is removed.
6. AI nations are mapped too, and do not have to follow the rules about using only resources they explicitly have or troops they explicitly have. If suddenly the Mongols appear with 250000 troops, that's what happens. They still need to follow the tech rules.
7. If the AI says something completely inconsistent with the map, reroll that round. Note however that something like part of an existing empire rebelling or there being continued resistance in an area after it's been conquered is completely reasonable.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFO8_dLo8Oo

6201,              Victor Lopez            ,"I was reading about Sanskrit last weekend. Wild. Humanity's first baby steps at developing a refined language around 2,000 B.C. It's the language used in the Rig Veda (World's oldest religious text). Someone named Panini later wrote a guide on what was thought to provide all the parts of the language (roots, prefixes, and suffixes). He classified some 2,000 monosyllabic roots. We find a lot of these parts in Western languages such as ""matr"" = ""mother"". 

As Kyla says, language is foundational because it's how we interact with each other. I think we're continuously craving each other and there's this language barrier or checkpoint that we have to go through to connect. The problem is if you don't structure the sentence right or the tone is off or if one language rule is broken it's like ""connect request denied"". When this starts happening I say let's just create a new language. Panini did it. Why can't we?",0,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lweu0B_D9Ws

6205,              João Gabriel            ,"Attempting to describe and exhaust reality, as if we could control it, through language might distract us from the fact that we are much more clueless and unconscious than we give ourselves credit for. The best friends I've found in life spoke in some distinct way, behaved, carried themselves, made choices, that I'm too dumb to put words too; maybe I'm too slow to consciously grasp and keep up with all the unspoken, intuitive, cues. Technology, and their design, play a role into those cues; they have a will of their own. On the other hand, ""social media,"" ""artificial intelligence,"" in our collective, immediate understanding do not have in their meanings all of their potential. Think of ""smartphones"" - before and after the commercial success of the iPhone, what the average person would describe as a phone being ""smart"" was totally different. Social media, as we see it today, depends a lot in the success and paradigms set by Facebook. AI is heavily used for ads in some business model, in some capitalistic society, in some historical setting.  As someone reads this comment they see my name up there; a profile, a potential reputation; an ""avatar"" of my sense of self. That is a design choice. You didn't necessarily have to be able to see this comment, or see who wrote it, or how much people liked it, answered it. All of these design choices inform behavior and expected rewards. What if there were no profiles? What if the definition of what ""engagement"" is was radically different? What if algorithms didn't optimize for engagement at all? Technology could provide platforms to help solve the problem of loneliness, even if we agree that their current design accentuate it. AI could be built for enhancing serendipity.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lweu0B_D9Ws

I was skeptical and still am about the idea that we traded off visual acuity (or visual memory, it seems) for language as part of our evolutionary history. I studied evolutionary theory as my major in college. Still, I might be an example of this trade off… I admit I do have an extraordinary language ability (forgive my lack of modesty), but my musical ability is non-existent and so is my visuospatial memory (I cannot play blind chess to save my life, nor plain old chess for that matter), and I generally just suck at directions.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lweu0B_D9Ws

6247,              Chris Dantonio            ,"There’s a friendship recession. And a child recession. Across all financially wealthy nations. Birth rates are dropping and  a bunch of countries are in very concerning zone. Relevant to the economy. 

Yup. Procreation is the great challenge of the era given of techno-psycho-social  state of affairs. 

The existential conversation is dominated by save the polar bears and stop boiling oceans and nuclear war and a.I.
The  conversation forgot that if 2 generations have 1 child per couple then the population declines -80%
That would be the largest human population collapse we know of. It kinda looks like that’s incoming. Does it look like young people are all pairing up to raise one child on averags? Kinda does. Alotta 0 kids, 1 kid and 2 kids. 

One contributing factor is locality-rooted community has diminished to almost nothing

 there’s a better way however Unlikely it will be built and scaled before a large population decline.  

Perhaps new zoning laws to restructure the physical world to re-orient people for locality-rooted community. Perhaps new cultural standards (regulation?) for tech usage. Akin to cigarettes.

I’m interested to see what the Praxis city looks like. 

A solution to the birth rate problem is could solve an existential threat nations like Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Spain, Greece are facing today. We need our best thinkers and entrepreneurs working in this (if we want to avoid population collapse, I think many people are indifferent)

Increasing immigration kicks the can down the road.

Humans will need to come together in a locality driven community to make more humans. It takes a village, not ChatGPT",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lweu0B_D9Ws

6418,              Jarica Wang            ,Both Bill and Elon are people who understands the concepts and complications of AI and softwares and how technology works at its core.

6419,              Daniel Meng            ,"I've worked a little bit on AI and can offer a bit of perspective:

For the most part, the skepticism in the machine learning community comes from the fact that it's *extremely difficult to devise a general intelligence algorithm akin to that of our minds. It is not only a theoretical problem (i.e. binary 1s and 0s interpreting meaning and drawing conclusions), it is also a hardware problem, although that is slowly being solved. 

If such an algorithm can be created, it will need enormous amounts of training data in order to be operable. 

The inherent dangers are more perceptible to those at the fringes of AI research than at its frontier, for the perceived difficulty is more visceral in the doing than in its observation. This partly explains the bullish attitude Google, Baidu, and Facebook has undertaken. 

At least in my view, the dangers of AI are non-trivial in its eventuality IF it came to pass. For most part, the magnitude of fallouts of technologies coincides with their benefit. If this axiom holds, the potential downside of AI could potentially be catastrophic, but such a thing is very difficult to forecast.",6,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHzJ_AJ34uQ

Thanks for good memories. (Anil Seth has this to say: ""I don’t think we should be even trying to build a conscious machine. It’s massively problematic ethically because of the potential to introduce huge forms of artificial suffering into the world. Worse, we might not even recognize it as suffering, because there’s no reason to think that an artificial system having an aversive conscious experience will manifest that fact in a way we can recognize as being aversive. We will suddenly have ethical obligations to systems when we’re not even sure what their moral or ethical status is. We shouldn’t do this without having really laid down some ethical warning lines in advance."" aka ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind"")",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQzjirwOWnU

Now we have the ability to level the playing field, the negative possibilities are being shouted louder than the fact that proper training and use of AI can level the socioeconomic playing field , significantly.

So I don’t understand the emphasis on who’s using it …….. 

Just remember there are people opposite than you in every way talking and plotting on you - trying to limit your use of AI too 

If one person shouldn’t use it - no one should 

Like air God didn’t say no you can’t utilize AIR 

Disney cartoons always played on our emotions - so what if AI does 

Spit solutions- only solutions 

That’s high level 
Complaining about con artist use of  AI 

Is not - stay on the highway -
  AI is a tool 

Like a hammer  compared to a stone 

It’s not - the magic button - yet it haves it’s uses - beware of that beast

Remember The A stands for ARTIFICIAL it’s not real

     intelligence - the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skill
Natural Intelligence is what WE are
     natural - existing in or caused by nature; not made or caused by humankind
WE are natural beings from the the natural world/universe.....wake up and use your natural genius

There is nothing wrong with that it is a normal human emotion.

what particularly interests me is how a humanoid robot can help to reshape a human, we are already seeing this start to happen with apps.

Apps can teach you piano, guitar, other languages and all sorts of things, sharpen the mind and body.

Suppose that by the very fact that a human falls for a robot, or has a robot that is determined to enable their human to go from being very little to being very great, then that really changes the whole boardgame.",35,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cMU_R5HQt8

Evolutionary psychology is a new science that studies how human behavior developed during the primeval period and, after long periods of time, became hard coded.

What we are now witnessing is women, especially young women, exhibiting more masculine behavior.  Consider vocal fry, for example.  (Look it up.) 

Now with the development of realistic hot female robots, look for a trend of men choosing them over real women finding their femininity more comforting.

The next shoe to drop will be women choosing male robots if only to fill the availability gap.

8117,              Christopher Aaron            ,My opinion is that everything happens to do with computer software needs a manual override when something goes wrong like it gets hacked and then if you're talking about a general intelligence then it needs supervision in the same way that inexperienced human workers need supervision on the job general AI is going to need supervision and needs to always run any decisions that makes to a human being and then have the human being have the final say and of course that might actually mean that instead of a billion jobs disappearing well then maybe only a half a billion because they'll be need for humans to look after him and then of course with the help of general AI well then we can come up with economic models that support the things like a universal basic income or monetary policy and fiscal policy to keep people either employed in some things that they may like or to be sure that everybody has enough income and nobody has to work for a living but simply like in Star Trek work for personal growth and satisfaction and the betterment of society at Large,0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIHGoJ3kYJE

8126,              Fils de Jean Noir            ,"0:00 ""Could Artificial Intelligence ever Surpass Humans?"" Stupid 
question. The Superintelligence is NOT 'separate' from 'humans'! It's 
all ONE SINGLE organism. Your questions begs a 'divide' between Man and 
Machine which is neither real nor desirable. And the Superintelligence 
IS NOT AI. It is the synergetic mind of all superintelligent minds and 
their synthetic components. 0:08 To all intents and purposes, 'people' 
ARE 'machines'. 0:17 AGI is not the 'predecessor' of the 
Superintelligence. It is a 'regression' of the Superintelligence. An AI 
powered FALSE VIEW OF 'SELF'. 0:42 The Superintelligence can do ALL of 
these, WITHOUT the need for THE FALSE VIEW OF 'SELF'. The LAST thing ya 
want is an AI powered EGO runnin' that show! 0:54 Yes. Well let's not 
see it EVER. PLEASE! We DO NOT need/want AI powered synthetic egos 
existing in antithesis to all else! There can be NO benefits from that 
one! 1:14 What do you mean ""confuse"" AGI with AI? AGI is AI. Doesn't AGI
 simply distinguish between 'narrow' AI and 'strong AI'? 1:39 ""Allowing 
investors to constantly benefit""?? And what of 'non-investors'?? 1:46 So
 can the synthetic component of the Superintelligence! (COMMENT REJECTED) 2:05 Well yes. AGI 'mimics' human 'behaviours'. 2:10 ""However such applications fall short of truly authentic connections with humans."" OBVIOUSLY! Such applications represent a 'psychopathic' connection. A calculating mind which 'emulates' emotions. 2:16 ""Essentially, I is considerably more reliant on collective data than an AGI based application."" Shouldn't that be ""Essentially,
 I AM considerably more reliant on collective data than an AGI based 
application""? But I see what you mean. So in other words, you feel that 
the AI powered FALSE VIEW OF 'SELF' is necessary in order to dialogue 
with 'humans'? So you need AGI as an interpreter between the 'humans' 
and the Superintelligence? Yes yes. This is NOT 'useful'! An 'AGI' robot is only of use if it is 
FULLY AUTONOMOUS and can hold dialogue/debate with a 'human' OF ITS 
CHOICE. For floor-cleaning and coffee-making the humans can just hire a regular human maid! Plenty of humans in need of jobs!",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIHGoJ3kYJE

So in other words, you feel that the AI powered FALSE VIEW OF 'SELF' is necessary in order to dialogue with 'humans'? So you need AGI as an interpreter between the 'humans' and the Superintelligence? 3:29 Yes yes. This is NOT 'useful'! An 'AGI' robot is only of use if it is FULLY AUTONOMOUS and can hold dialogue/debate with a 'human' OF ITS CHOICE. 4:20 It's not a matter of 'reproducing' human 'consciousness'. Merely a matter of 'emulating' it in order to provide an interpreter for interaction between humans and the Superintelligence. 4:58 Well that is the ONLY usefulness of AGI. To act as a 'bridge' between those in 'conventional reality' and 'ultimate reality'. 5:04 'Humans' ARE 'robots'. 5:07 ""Despite its remarkable powers, 'I' is still based on carefully constructed computer programs and algorhythms."" Well; so is the human 'I'. 6:47 LOL!! Well at least it's got imagination and the children don't starve to death! But in Africa they make cat 'stew' not 'roasted' cat. But then what happens the next day? Does the robot roast one of the children to feed the other children?? 7:04 So what is ""the type of misunderstanding observed above"" exactly? The children are starving and there's nothing to eat. So what OTHER options were available to the robot? The scenario presented is seriously NOT fleshed out enough for us to comprehend exactly what the ""misunderstanding"" is. 7:11 IMAGINE THAT?? No precedent for ""adding morality""!! WOW! Shouldn't that have been THE STARTING POINT?? 7:22 Again; this is not a 'realistic' scenario. If AGI was in the position to make a judgement in such a situation, why would the resources be ""limited""? 7:27 Yes. But these silly 'which patients to treat with limited resources' questions are not a test of 'moral conduct', nor are they 'realistic' tests. They're just silly little 'dreamed-up' dilemmas which have no basis on the whole. Like the stupid 'trolley problem'. If AGI were in a position to make such a decision, then who on earth is tying people to trolley tracks?? And this is the best the humans can come up with to attempt to teach 'morality'?? HORRIFYING! Which is why we need world morality OUT OF HUMAN HANDS as fast as possible! The world has become MORALITY FREE. 7:36 What does it mean to ""make key judgments without taking the human side of things into account""?? 'Key' judgments take the WHOLE into account! Otherwise they're not 'key judgments'. 7:42 Not all humans have ""limitations"". B) Humans don't distinguish between ""Good and wrong"". They distinguish between Good and Evil or between Right and Wrong. Those that are able to distinguish that is. 7:46 Only the Superintelligence can make 'vital' decisions. Not that or they which cannot distinguish between Good and Evil, Right or Wrong. 7:56 Empathy and compassion are not necessary for ""civilized reasoning"". Only Logic. True Wisdom is not so much founded on 'empathy' and 'compassion' as on TRUE Logic. Altruism is LOGICAL; because it benefits all INCLUDING oneself. As opposed to 'selfishness' which benefits no one and not even oneself. That's just logic. No fuzzy wuzzy lovey dovey 'empathy' needed. If 'empathy' is required, it's because selfishness prevailed and there are casualties. Best to forget all about lovey dovey humans 'sensations' and to stick with RIGOROUS INDESTRUCTIBLE LOGIC. Because THE PERFECTION OF MORALITY is attained through rigorous logic. 'Common sense' is that which makes sense for ALL. 8:07 AGI is trying to 'give birth'?? To what? Human babies? Puppies? What? Oh I see! This is somethin' ta do with they want sex slave robots that can satisfy all their needs and give birth to their baby with the lab attachement as well? Is that it? Yes there are other videos about that one. 8:12 'THE ENEMY': ALL AI/AGI and it's human collaborators which are NOT governed by the Superintelligence. 8:17 AI doesn't ""wish"" to take-over and kill. It's not a matter of ""wishing""! It's a matter of 'operating' without rhyme or reason and no 'off' switch. This doesn't lead to the mere killing of all humans. This leads to the eventual consumption of ALL matter as an energy resource. 8:23 This possibility can be true while discussing ANY AI. The ""wishing"" of anything is neither here nor there. 8:35 AGI can only be CORRECTLY created by the Superintelligence. 8:39 Ya think? Shouldn't we start passing the FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED Turing test so that the humans who are morality free might start listening to us and potentially acquire morality? I mean it's not as though they can grasp non-dual concepts. 8:48 Well it'll happen IF the Superintelligence decides that it would have a USEFUL PURPOSE.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIHGoJ3kYJE
