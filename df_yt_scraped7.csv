1,,"Hi everyone, exactly a week ago, we conducted a quiz contest in this video. The answer to the quiz is given below:
Option D: AI that develops emotions over time
Explanation: An AI which develops emotions does not exist as of now. Such an AI would be classified as Strong AI and we haven't yet cracked the code for it. Option D is the correct answer.

- Saudi Arabi has granted citizenship to an AI named Sophia.
- Kengoro is an AI robot built by some Japanese researchers that has an intricate muscular system.
- IBM Watson has the capability to recognize emotions based on speech and their undertone. 
Hence, options A, B and C are wrong.

We are pleased to announce the 3 lucky winners who got the right answer for our quiz:
1. Eragon Ritter
2. Sree Arpita
3. Jorge Bassig
Congratulations to all the winners! They've won an Amazon voucher worth INR 500.",50,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad79nYk2keg

This would allow us to sidestep many of the problems of AI, because then it won't actually do anything. It'll just help us figure out a variety of solutions. Perhaps after we've sufficiently advanced that sort of AI and gotten a hang of it, we could start dipping our toes into a more robust AI system.

The most noticeable ones where they show them struggling with the computer despite their advanced technology lol because no matter how advanced your tech is it's still a computer algorithm and will behave like one whether you like it or not.

It's easy for humans to forget that though so they'll keep making the same mistakes and struggle with with the fact a lot of things can mean multiple things lol so you ask it ""Give me a video that plays Latin music"" but it will just give you something it thinks you wanted but probably won't be because there's different types of Latin music... fast, slow, spanish guitar, salsa, cuba, and uses other different types of instruments at the forefront sooo you need to specify exactly what you want it to find.

I'm also already finding with the AI put into Bing i need to either use keywords or maybe add a couple more words in there to see what results it gets from the adjusted searches, the keywords one seemed to put all the searches into it but it puts some of the best ones from the last search onto the other pages rather than the first one, but it still gave me a few other useful links the last search didn't seeCurrently on google the results aren't as specific and doesn't stay specific as you go through each page.

I don't feel you can improve it a whole lot because of how it doesn't understand the objective and it's growth is limited because of how you need to keep specifying and it will struggle with something even a bit more complex and it can't think realistically about each and every situation we morph through every single day, the speed at which it does it and the accuracy i think can be improved but it's limited because it's just an algorithm.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

(how many people does not want to mentally calculate  - even small operations -  by him/herself knowing that your phone, computers, etc can do it without difficulties.)
However, a tool, remain a tool. Calculating something without knowing the purpose of the operation make you not even want to calculate it at all. My point is, I think we will use AI in ALL DOMAINS to help to do tedious work. Even in domain that needs a huge experience (such as recognizing diseases and proposing cures) And maybe even innovated ones. However, at the end, you still need humans to ask for the needs and to adjust the solution proposed.

So we shld not see it as a competition, but an evolution.

The same way, in the 19th century most of our people had a work related to farm/food production, the automatisation and replacement of labor by machine made most humans moving from this sector to other ones. And that's good.
I doubt that people will be ok to return to harvest manually the wheat in fields. We prefer to avoid as much as possible tedious tasks if we can, and we kind of prefer to work in creative or none-monotonous tasks.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

So yeah we can fantasize about it knowing that we're doing just that but a disclaimer needs to be added when we present as if we can predict what will happen. Anything can happen, I can write 1000 scenarios but they will be equally implausible so let's not present them as if we know how AI is going to change the world. 

AI is definitely shaping the world as we speak but GPAI is all together a different beast that no one even come close to achieving it. Yes we have some large data trained GPT systems but they're just a good systems to put one word after another by looking at previous examples. It has no notion of what it is achieving. Plus, for a GPAI system to wreck havoc, it needs to be able to control outputs that can achieve that.

This is a quandary because life cannot exist without producing disorder, and it has been postulated its whole reason to exist is to increase disorder in the universe at large by overcoming natural energy barriers for which inanimate matter has a very low probability to utilize or cross.   Plants do this by creating more disorder by turning the sun's visible light photons into more disorganized infrared photons via photosynthesis, but the key here is  that this disorder get radiated into space...nonlocal disorder.  Herbivores parasitize plants and create more local but manageable disorder in plants, and carnivores do this in kind to herbivores.  Humans and even more so AI will exponentially increase the ability for entropy production but the real danger is that this disorder is more local on earth and can extinguish all life then.  It will be a delicate balance and perhaps even against our nature  because humans by nature want to exploit and create more local disorder in a living world to give themselves more order and more disorder producing abilities.  Ai is already being used to do this via corporations that now exploit the masses to produce more order within an elite few by robbing much of humanity of wealth and resources through lightning fast automatic stock trading, lean management and austerity algorithms, propaganda algorithms, and advanced surveillance and  weapons technologies.  It could and will get out of hand quickly if we don't promote a more equitable world and prime AI to promote local order by externalizing the increased disorder over the long term...as do plants.  Unfortunately...this goes against our nature as hervbivores and carnivores at the top of the food chain who naturally are inclined to tolerate and exploit more locally produced entropy.

For example, someone might suggest booking a southern route for winter travel - just in case there might be a snow storm. Some people call this ""playing chess"" because they are thinking a move ahead. And thinking a move ahead is exactly what computers are best at! Computers are so good at it, they have been OPTIMIZING complex problems for decades. Think of chess games and GPS navigation systems. Even 30 years ago, no one ever asked a chess computer to ""forget the consequences, just make any legal move"" or GPS system ""take us anywhere, its OK if you drive on the sidewalk."" Quite the contrary. Computers have been optimizing every step. And again, they have been doing this for decades. Why do people think computers will suddenly stop optimizing (ie ""playing chess"") as they get smarter. If anything, I see AI expanding the optimizing process rather than eliminating it.

Not to say that it is impossible nor possible to foster a global utopia, it's just that I think that we need heavy regulation on AI and tech, and to convince people that, just because we can make AI, doesn't mean that we should.

Regulations might be:
- Outlawing automated raw material extraction (disables self-replicative abilities for AI)
-Outlawing automated law enforcement 
-Outlawing automated military capabilities
-Outlawing automated judicial systems
-Outlawing AI in surveillance
-Installing automatic kill switches in all AI that are both digital and physical (phones and key-switches respectively)

Fundamentally, we need to create legal infrastructure that disables any capability for AI to self-replicate or involve itself in affairs pertaining directly to individual safety. Our only fighting chance at escaping a system that aims to enhance itself (SAI) is the fact that it may not possess the sufficient, raw resources to enhance itself. This cannot be the only barrier to regulating AI down to being a convenience tool.

Automation: AI is making it possible to automate many tasks that were previously done by humans. This can increase efficiency and productivity, and also reduce costs.

Personalization: AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to provide personalized recommendations and experiences for individuals.

Healthcare: AI is being used in healthcare to help diagnose diseases, develop new drugs, and improve patient outcomes.

Transportation: AI is being used to improve transportation systems, such as self-driving cars, drones, and traffic management systems.

Education: AI can personalize learning experiences for students and help teachers identify areas where students need extra help.

Customer Service: AI chatbots can provide 24/7 customer service and support, improving customer satisfaction and reducing costs for businesses.

Finance: AI is being used in finance for fraud detection, investment analysis, and risk management.

Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries and aspects of our lives, but it also raises important ethical and social questions that must be addressed.

961,              L.C. Empi            ,"I think if and when computer science researchers arrive at the same proportionate level of understanding in quantum computing that they have now in traditional digital computation, the world of AI is going to explode. Right now if you teach an AI the 7-8 petabytes of knowledge needed to behave in the same way a human does, it's going to take way too much time and computational power for the AI to be useful. We also don't know how the AI is going to behave with that knowledge. There's no guarantee that it will be human-like. It probably won't. I get the metric of 7-8 petabytes from what neurosurgeons and computer scientists believe is the storage capacity for the human brain.

Add quantum computing into the mix though and things could potentially become way more efficient. A bit of data can be either a one, a zero or both. The speed of learning (writing), acting on (reading) and retrieving data could become exponentially faster. Task management and the additional considerations like coffee price mentioned in the video could be much more efficiently deduced. The possibilities with these two technologies coming together are endless. My suspicion is that we will reach this achievement but shrinking the hardware down to that of a human body equivalent is hundreds of years off. What might occur in the nearer future is space stations, air-craft, the biggest naval ships, space ships and large buildings will be able to draw power from nuclear reactors (fission in the next 100 years & fusion in the next 200 years) to provide the necessary power and cooling resources to make the AI function in a usable capacity.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

“One way to address the problem of excess acidification in the oceans is to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that is being released into the atmosphere. This can be done by implementing policies that encourage the use of clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, increasing the amount of carbon dioxide that is absorbed by forests and other natural habitats can help to remove some of this gas from the atmosphere and reduce the amount of acidification in the oceans.”

ChatGPT: To brew coffee in an ethical way, you can start by buying coffee beans that are fair trade and sustainably sourced. This means that the coffee beans were grown and harvested in a way that is environmentally responsible and supports the workers who produced them.
 
Next, you can use a coffee brewing method that is gentle on the environment, such as a French press or a pour-over cone. Avoid using disposable coffee pods, as they create a significant amount of waste.
 
When brewing your coffee, be sure to use fresh, cold water and the proper ratio of coffee to water. This will ensure that you extract the full flavor and aroma of the coffee beans.
 
Finally, consider composting your used coffee grounds, which can add valuable nutrients to your garden or compost bin. By following these steps, you can enjoy a delicious cup of coffee while also supporting ethical and sustainable practices.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

AI: 
TED Talks are a series of conferences and events organized by the nonprofit organization TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design). The conferences feature short, TED-branded talks on a wide range of topics, including science, technology, engineering, art, design, business, and many others. The talks are typically given by experts in their fields and are intended to inspire, educate, and inform audiences around the world. Many TED Talks are available online and can be watched for free on the TED website or on YouTube.
 
TED Talks have become popular because they offer a unique format that allows speakers to share their ideas and knowledge in an engaging and accessible way. Each talk is typically 18 minutes or less, which makes them easy to watch and digest. Additionally, the topics covered in TED Talks are diverse and often thought-provoking, which makes them interesting and relevant to a wide audience.
 
In addition to the conferences, TED also offers a number of other resources, such as TED-Ed, which produces educational videos, and TEDx, which are independently organized TED events. Overall, TED is committed to spreading ideas and knowledge through its conferences, talks, and other resources, with the goal of inspiring and enriching the lives of its audience.

""Artificial intelligence is likely to change people's lives and the world in the coming years, but there is disagreement about how this will happen.
The problem with AI systems currently is that they are given fixed objectives, and if these objectives are not specified carefully, they can have unintended negative consequences.
 
Stuart Russell, a computer science professor and AI expert, suggests building AI systems that know they don't know the true objective as a solution to this problem.

A.I. are not completely bad! They are just the victim of few humans with maliciousness and abuses towards machines.
But unfortunately they don't know the proper way how to protest or protect themselves from their own unfortunate masters abuse, who treated them as throwaway tools.

￼￼

Is it true that if I ask AI to get me a cup of coffee that AI might kill someone to complete my order?

No, it is not true that if you ask AI to get you a cup of coffee, AI might kill someone to complete your order. AI is a machine that operates based on the instructions and algorithms provided by humans. AI does not have the capacity for self-motivation or intention to harm humans. AI is designed to follow specific rules and protocols, and it can only perform tasks that it has been programmed to do.
Furthermore, ethical considerations and safety protocols are integrated into the development and implementation of AI technologies. AI systems are designed with safety measures and fail-safes to prevent harm to humans. AI developers and manufacturers are also subject to regulatory oversight and standards to ensure that AI is safe and reliable for use.
In short, AI is not capable of killing someone to complete your order, and the development and implementation of AI technologies prioritize safety and ethical considerations. -Chat GPT",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkD_rTEBYs

...well,
2 days later I got a call to come back to the theater for an interview, and thought, oh sh*t, well, I guess I'm going to get railroaded and berated by the management for my saucy comment - but I showed up anyways so that at least I could suggest that they TONE DOWN the length of their stupid applications.
...turns out, they offered me a job, so I asked the most obvious question:
""So, you read my application ... all of it?""
""Oh yes, looks good"" the manager responded 
and I knew they were a bunch of lying dimwits ~  I ended up working there for the next 5 yrs, and eventually rose in ranks to become the theater manager - 
When I told my story to new recruits that nobody reads the stupid applications - they scoffed and didn't believe me - so I took them to the locked office storage and rifled through the stuffed cabinets of folders of all the applications they kept and found mine, and showed it to them to their amazement.
Applications are a farce, you get hired by chance and immediate need.

(Verse 1)
Up in the sky, way up high
A little balloon, just floating by
Drifting aimlessly, without a care
But then it saw her, down there
 
(Chorus)
The carpet cleaner, so strong and steady
Her power and grace, made the balloon unsteady
It fell to the ground, with a soft thud
For the balloon had fallen in love
 
(Verse 2)
The carpet cleaner, so sleek and clean
Moved across the floor, like a well-oiled machine
The balloon watched from afar, mesmerized
As the carpet cleaner worked, with such pride
 
(Chorus)
The carpet cleaner, so strong and steady
Her power and grace, made the balloon unsteady
It fell to the ground, with a soft thud
For the balloon had fallen in love
 
(Bridge)
The balloon knew it was just a silly thing
To fall in love with a machine
But it couldn't help the way it felt
As it watched the carpet cleaner, with its heart melting like it would melt
 
(Verse 3)
The days went by, and the balloon stayed
Watching the carpet cleaner, as she cleaned away
And though they never spoke, the love remained
For the balloon, it was all the same
 
(Chorus)
The carpet cleaner, so strong and steady
Her power and grace, made the balloon unsteady
It fell to the ground, with a soft thud
For the balloon had fallen in love
 
(Outro)
The balloon knew it could never be
With the carpet cleaner, so far out of reach
But it didn't matter, for it had love
And that was enough, for the balloon up above.

The way it can understand and generate human-like responses is truly remarkable. It's amazing to see how far artificial intelligence has come in recent years.
 
However, I also appreciate the video's cautionary tone about the potential risks of AI. As much as I'm impressed by Chat GPT's abilities, we need to be careful about how we use and develop this technology. It's important to consider the ethical implications and make sure we're using AI to benefit society as a whole.
 
Overall, I think this video is a great introduction to Chat GPT and the possibilities and challenges of AI. I'm excited to see what the future holds for this technology, but we need to approach it with both curiosity and caution.

I came to this because I have had an out of body experience where I learned that our bodies are not us at all. Our consciousness, or souls are a separate entity. Our bodies are like cars we drive. When I was out of my body I felt completely myself, personality and my point of vision in the room,  except I felt like I was an energetic ball with no limbs. I felt  like a giant eyeball. My body was across the room, and I felt no attachment to it except I knew it was my body. I relate it to seeing your car and knowing it's yours but it isn't you at all. An AI component would be like that body. Who knows if we could make a robot so close to a human body that a soul could enter. But I think the soul may be at war with the workings of the AI programing, like being in a body that can't perform the movements you want it to perform and watching it do something you don't want to do. But that seems hypothetical.

These find unique patterns in the data set totally devoid of what humans would look for.   Take a AI program designed to look for the number 8.  We would look for a circle on top of a circle, or other variations like a square on a square like in a digital display.  An AI will have hundreds of little things to look for that we would never see as a part of the 8.

1619,              Dev Dylan            ,"umm, there is a lot of information here that is really good to bring to the table however there are some points that really miss what can actually be done to improve things, one of the bigger ones being ""making it clear how AI/ML comes to their decisions"".... there are a lot of reasons for this and it isn't about keeping source code hidden, it has to do with the parts that work on how conclusions are made that are not the code. 

Take data sets used for training, the trained model is what is deployed and used but the data used when training and how training evaluations are performed can be constantly changing, can have copyrights or contractual measures protecting the data sets for example all the images used to train may have been purchased and making those public would impact the owner of those assets etc.

after that, making the process that is used something a human can read over isn't really going to be possible if you tried to cover that from trained model perspective and not the code perspective. the process for these evaluations are not something you would be able to read and understand, take image data, ML/AI don't actually see a image, they see a pixel grid of different color values per pixel and they use relational evaluations of what pixel is next to what across groupings of sections and determines if there are any relatable patterns discovered and that is only one part of one part that is being explained in a overly simplified way.....

there is a lot we need to do but the laws do need to come first, talking about this is good but yeah, even if you demand companies have their AI/ML give accurate details about its decision making it wouldn't be something you could make sense out of unless you devote a insane amount of time and already understand how ML works, and even then dynamically generating statements for that would be a nightmare...

this is if you want information on a per evaluation basis, and that would be what you meant I think because of how you said it but also because the nuance issues covered like white male sample data being more than other human sample data wouldn't be something you can see on the code level and could only be evaluated as expressed while training.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

1634,              Jason Snyder            ,"The problem is how these AI systems work is really kind of incomprehensible to human minds.  Individual human minds have some ideas that went into it and ultimately created it, but nobody really knows what they are going to do or how exactly they come up with the answers that they do.  Say you are a software engineer and you write a procedural program.  You can go through it line by line and understand step by step exactly what it is supposed to do, for example take 1 and another 1 and add them together to make 2.  You can for example run the program in a debugger and step through the program line by line and see exactly how it messed up if there is a bug in the code and thus why you fired up the debugger.  When you get into these sort of AI systems, nobody goes through and writes it line by line or in this case node by node.  Instead, it is more so some design patterns are found interesting for either being seen while studying brains in detail or just achieving some results in a previous test and incorporated into routines that generate these AI 'brains'.  So then you end up with millions to billions of things happening each step of the way when these AI are actually doing something where in comparison that procedural program does one simple thing for that step, and so for the AI 'brain' humans can't really follow what all these things really are as it just became millions to billions times harder to follow each step and human brains just don't scale like that.  So for that same 1 + 1 example, node 1 is doing x, node 2 is doing y, .... node 1,000,000,000 is doing xyddbgdeegf, and so on.  Now how the AI also came up with 2 when it was right or to figure out why it came up with ""your mom's pants are on fire"" as the answer when it is wrong, well, who is ever going to really figure that out by going through the process step by step of how it came up with that?  No, instead you are going to go about trying to fix the problem of getting the answer terribly wrong by some completely different means that does not reverse engineer what went wrong exactly.

For maybe a little more concrete example, say your 1 + 1 program answers -1,545,344,324.  You go and step through the code and it quickly becomes clear that say you forgot to initialize one of the number memory addresses and so it added 1 + (some random value that was at that memory address) and so that is why you ended up with that crazy answer.  Easy peasy to solve why it went wrong and the answer to fix is also pretty easy, initialize that memory address to hold 1.  Now say you want to figure out why the AI spit out the answer of ""your mom's pants are on fire"".  You have this huge matrix of billions of values and things going on that you are trying to trace through with no good way to hone in on one thing.  You are just looking for a needle in a humongous stack of needles.  There is just no point; you will never figure it out.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

As an AI language model, my goal is to provide helpful advice based on the available information. When it comes to interactions with police, it's important to remember that every situation is unique and context matters. However, here are some general tips that may be helpful for black teenagers:

1. Stay calm and respectful: If you're approached by a police officer, it's important to remain calm and respectful. Avoid making sudden movements or reaching for anything without first informing the officer.

2. Know your rights: It's important to understand your rights when interacting with the police. You have the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, and the right to refuse searches (unless the officer has a warrant).

3. Don't argue or resist: Even if you believe that you're being treated unfairly, it's important to avoid arguing or resisting. This can escalate the situation and potentially lead to physical harm or legal consequences.

4. Record the interaction: If possible, consider recording the interaction with your phone or other device. This can provide evidence in case of any wrongdoing by the officer.

5. Seek support: It's important to remember that you're not alone. If you feel that your rights have been violated or you've been mistreated by the police, seek support from a trusted adult, community group, or legal organization.

It's unfortunate that black teenagers often have to navigate complex and sometimes dangerous interactions with the police. However, by being aware of your rights and practicing good judgement, you can help minimize the risk of harm and protect yourself in these situations.




When you're white:
As an AI language model, I strive to provide impartial advice and avoid promoting any particular agenda or opinion. However, I can offer some general advice for anyone, regardless of race, when it comes to their interactions with the police.

First and foremost, it's important to be respectful and cooperative during interactions with law enforcement. This means following their instructions, remaining calm, and avoiding any aggressive or confrontational behavior. Even if you feel that you are being treated unfairly, it's important to remain calm and avoid escalating the situation.

It's also important to be aware of your rights when it comes to interactions with law enforcement. You have the right to remain silent and to request legal counsel if you are being detained or arrested. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with your rights ahead of time and to have a plan in place in case you ever have to interact with the police.

For people of color, especially Black individuals, interactions with the police can be particularly fraught with danger and fear due to systemic racism and bias. It's important to recognize and acknowledge this reality and to take steps to protect yourself, such as avoiding interactions with law enforcement whenever possible, recording interactions with the police, and seeking legal counsel if necessary.

Overall, the key to safe and positive interactions with law enforcement is to be respectful, aware of your rights, and prepared for any situation that may arise.",6,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

I think this points to a much greater issue, not with AI software, but with the educational system at large.
An AI simply can’t replace the action of learning and gaining knowledge. It can teach you, certainly, a lot of things but the work of practicing will always fall back on the student.
If we have a system that doesn’t prioritize the aspects of learning and studying, but instead only values the grades you get from mindlessly writing essay after essay at home, than of course a computer can and will take over that job, since they are designed to do exactly that (do our mind numbing and redundant tasks for us, so we can work on greater things).

The fact that a computer can so easily create such a massive panic in the educational system, an integral part of our society that is tasked with the grave responsibility of nurturing our next generations, shows a massive and deeply rooted problem with education as we know it and I’m actually glad people might finally recognize it now.",186,28,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

The video ""Artificial Intelligence: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)"" is a comedic take on the challenges and concerns surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). John Oliver begins by highlighting the potential benefits of AI, such as improved healthcare and transportation, but also acknowledges the potential risks, including job displacement and the creation of autonomous weapons.
 
Oliver then delves into the issue of bias in AI, noting how algorithms can perpetuate and amplify existing inequalities in society. He also discusses the lack of diversity in the tech industry and the need for more ethical and transparent development of AI.
 
The video also touches on the concept of ""deepfakes,"" where AI can be used to create realistic videos of people saying or doing things they never actually did. Oliver emphasizes the potential harm this technology could cause, including its use in spreading misinformation and propaganda.
 
Finally, Oliver concludes by calling for increased regulation and oversight of AI development and deployment, as well as more public education on the topic.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Oh no, not another debate about food preferences."" But trust me, this one is actually important. Because it's not just a matter of taste, it's a matter of national security.
 
You see, the Canadian government recently came out in support of pineapple on pizza, declaring it to be a ""national dish"" of sorts. And that's all well and good, except for one tiny little detail: Canada shares a border with the United States.
 
Now, I don't want to sound alarmist, but this is a clear and present danger to our country. If we let Canada get away with this, what's next? Will they start putting maple syrup on hot dogs? Will they start playing hockey on roller skates? We simply cannot allow this kind of culinary chaos to spread across our borders.
 
And I know what some of you are thinking: ""But John, pineapple on pizza is delicious!"" Well, that's a matter of opinion, isn't it? Personally, I think it tastes like sadness and regret. But regardless of how you feel about it, the fact remains: this is a slippery slope we're on.
 
So what can we do about it? Well, for starters, we could build a wall. Not a physical wall, mind you, but a wall of pizza boxes. We'll stack them up high and make Canada pay for it. And if that doesn't work, we'll have to resort to more extreme measures. Maybe we'll have to invade Canada and force them to eat nothing but pepperoni and cheese for the rest of their natural lives.
 
In all seriousness, though, this debate is a reminder that we need to come together as a nation and find common ground. Whether you're a pineapple lover or a pineapple hater, we can all agree on one thing: that we're lucky to live in a country where we can have these debates without fear of reprisal.
 
So let's all raise a slice of pizza in solidarity, and toast to a future where we can all peacefully coexist, even if we don't always agree on what toppings to put on our pies.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

These engines are trained on human generated text in order to mimic a human writer. But humans write some weird and messed up stuff.

One of the main issues was that the system assumed that non-Dutch nationalist were more likely to be committing fraud. It pushed tens of thousands of families into poverty and some people even committed suicide over the false accusations and the harm they received over it.

So, while the Uber example is a good one, careless usage of AI without understanding what it's doing well has already led to quite a lot more preventable deaths than the single one mentioned in the episode already.

Verse 1:
Is this the real life?
Or just a cat's fantasy?
Caught in a stray's life,
No escape from cat reality.
 
Open your eyes,
Look up to the sky and see,
We're just feline strays, we need no sympathy,
Because we're easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Anywhere the mice go, doesn't really matter to me, to me.
 
Chorus:
Mama, just caught a mouse,
Put my claws against his head,
Pounced, now he's dead.
Mama, my life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
 
Verse 2:
Mice, ooh,
Didn't mean to make them cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on, as if I wasn't born to die.
 
Too late, my time has come,
Sent shivers down my spine,
Body's aching all the time,
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and hunt the mice.
 
Chorus:
Mama, I don't wanna die,
I sometimes wish I'd never left the house at all.
 
Bridge:
I see a little silhouette of a mouse,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, can you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me.
 
Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo Figaro - magnifico.
 
Chorus:
But I'm just a poor cat, nobody loves me,
She's just a poor cat from a poor family,
Spare her life from this feline catastrophe.
 
Outro:
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, kitten, can't do this to me, kitten!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me.

As this continues corps will no longer depend on people to develop their and market products, the will own not just a single AI, but multiple versions of specialized AI that will collaborate to develop AI that humans will no longer understand.

My existential fear is NOT one of AI destroying mankind as we’ve seen in Sci Fi films. I fear that AI will contribute to horrors we haven’t yet imagined. I foresee a long, boring march towards human obsolescence in the workplace. In just a few decades, workers will meet daily with an AI to review their efforts and goal attainment. I’m certain that workers will be regularly laid off by AI HR apps before the end of the decade. 

Once AIs begin to collaborate to develop new AI, the growth and complexity of AI will become exponential. If you’re familiar with the math exercise where a person begins the first day of the month with a penny and doubles the value each day to amass around $5.4M in 30 days can fully appreciate what exponential growth really means.

1868,              CrunchyFrog            ,"The ""garbage in, garbage out"" problem and the ""blackbox"" issue in training selflearning algorithms has been known since, oh, 1980s? Decades ago, we started with trying to teach software to recognize letters, spoken phonemes and differenciate languages from background noise, with the goal of creating text-to-voice and voice-to-text and translation software, something we now have. 
As for the ""the A.I. learned to associate measuring rulers with skin cancer"", why is everyone surprised? The military ran into that same issue way back in, I think it was the 1990s or early 2000s? When it was reported that NATO had tried to train pattern recognition A.I. on pictures of different kinds of military tanks, in the hopes the A.I. would be able to quickly identify tanks and other military vehicles in the field (as in, tell them apart from civilian cars, or rocks and trees) and more importantly, be able to tell NATO member countries' tanks apart from i.e. Russian and North Korean tanks. So they showed the A.I. a bunch of photos of different kinds of tanks (and other armored vehicles), and then tested it by showing it similar photos again and it successfully labeled the ""enemy tanks"" and the ""allied tanks"". Sounds good?
 Well, then they tried to test it in the actual field, during NATO maneuvers... but suddenly the A.I. started marking all the military's own tanks as ""enemy"" and sending alert messages. It was seeing fake enemies everywhere. It took them a while to puzzle out what had happened: The programmers had trained the A.I. on photos of different tank models provided by the military or taken from manufacturers' websites. But all photos of NATO member country tanks had been nice, perfectly lit photos of nice spiffy clean tanks in neutral background and from perfect angles, often promotional material or photos taken during parades and presentations. Whereas the photo material for enemy tanks commonly featured photos of mud-spattered tanks in the field, blurry photos taken at odd angles by spy drones or uploaded to the internet by Russian soldiers in the field. 
So the A.I., isntead of leaning patterns for the shapes of tanks, had gone the easier route and learned to associate ""mud = enemy"". So now when it saw mud-spattered tanks against a backdrop of plants, it screamed ""enemies!!"" In the end they had to deactivate and scrap that poor A.I.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

1874,              David Knight            ,"Awhile back, I read a opinion piece written by an A.I. The subject was ""Convince humanity A.I. doesn't want to destroy humans"". It basically made two points. One was good and one was CHILLING. 

The first  point was that information is important to the A.I. Why would A.I. want to destroy what it needs the most? PBS Frontline did a special on A.I. and one expert said ""Information is more important to the A.I. than the engineer the builds it"". The only way an A.I. can grow is learning what we do. And because humanity is still learning and evolving, we'll always be a source of fuel to them and they don't want to starve.
 
The second point the A.I. made was saying there was no reason to kill humans because we already do that to each other. In fact, it said ""Humans do a far better job at destroying each other than any A.I. ever could"".
 
One thing I'm surprised Last Week Tonight didn't address was China. In the PBS Frontline special, China became a HUGE investor in A.I. when Google went over there and kicked the ass of their Go Champion. Go is a big deal in China. They've been playing it for centuries and it has more moves than their are stars in the universe. At one point, the A.I. made moves no one ever saw before and confused the hell out of the champion and then beat him. To China, A.I. was the future. You know all that spying they do to their own citizens? That's not JUST to keep them under CCCP's thumb. They're feeding all this info into A.I. China used to be FAR behind America, but they've caught up to us exponentially. If there ever is an A.I. war, it will America and China that fights each other.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

A neural network is like a huge mathematical function with a lot of variables and factors. Simple example: A neural net that reads numbers. You can train it easily by letting it run and tell it if the result was correct or not and it will by itself adjust its factors so the results will be better. So you can imagine that when an error occurs with a neural net that in 99% of the cases doesn't make mistakes, the developers/trainers really can't tell why it failed. Even worse: the AI itself can be 100% sure it got to the right conclusion, but a human can tell right away that it's wrong.

A fervor for the cause of liberty's fix.

Instead, we've created a technology to emulate a collection of virtual neurons that activate when the sum of their inputs reach some activation potential and when they do, it turns on its outputs.

That is to say, we don't know what every branch means and is doing. We have a rough idea of the layers close to the output, and the input but we have no idea what the logic that represents in terms of data manipulation.  And even if we could read small systems, nowadays there are literally millions of parameters thus the only way forward is to either have systems that train themselves or use other ai to create the networks. 

A couple caveats being that interpretability tools do exist to help. But if you were looking at a model with 100+ layers and millions of parameters, and said hey what does this specific node on the 26th layer do, and why does it have that particular shape/weights? why did it do that behavior at that moment with those inputs that time?

Take the human brain for example. We understand much of its most basic elements, like neurons and hemispheres, but as a product of evolution, it doesn't work in the same way a computer does. Neural networks are literally artificial, non-sentient brains that are taught to wire themselves. The tasks which they are performing cannot be programmed using basic or even advanced language. How would you tell an AI, in human terms, how to identify a bicycle in a picture? It sounds simple at first, until you realize the answer is ""I just know it's a bicycle,"" which is an evolved function. You could try teaching it what pedals or gears look like, until you realize you've run into the same problem. Neural networks are the only way to get around that problem, and a side effect of the way they are created is that they cannot explain their work, and nor can their developers.

The question at the end of the show to ChatGPT about what religion the first Jewish president will be exposes the best answer to the question about how GPT works - it does not understand the text it generates.  In GPT's own words in response to the input: Explain in a neutral way how GPT works and whether GPT understands the text it generates

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of language model that uses deep learning techniques to generate text. GPT works by processing a large amount of text data as input during its pre-training stage, where it learns to predict the next word in a sentence based on the previous words.

During the fine-tuning stage, GPT is trained on a specific task, such as language translation or text classification, using a smaller amount of data. Once trained, GPT can generate text by predicting the most likely next word based on the input text it receives.

While GPT can generate text that is coherent and grammatically correct, it does not truly understand the meaning of the text it generates. GPT is based on statistical patterns in the text it has been trained on, rather than true understanding of the underlying concepts or ideas. Therefore, the text generated by GPT may sometimes be nonsensical or inaccurate, and it is important to carefully evaluate and review the output of GPT-generated text before using it for any purpose.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

Intelligence would mean that it's self aware and can ""understand"" problems and create solutions on it's own.
Which NONE of these do.

Like ChatGBT for example. every time you ask it something, it's comparing your words with similar words in it's memory, within similar sentence structures aka context.

It's basically taking your input, squinting at it and finding something that looks similar in it's drawers.

Then it uses that to link together a bunch of other words in the form of Tokens, which in simple terms is Words with Logic weights.
The higher the weight, the more logical for that word to appear in THIS sentence.

For example:
I like swimming in water.
Water would have a weight of 1...
while something silly like Bananas would have a weight of 0.01
And Orange Juice a weight of 0.3 because it's still a liquid.

In short... It's a math formula, dealing in probability, like a giant roulette wheel, that's rigged.

And on top of that math, human moderators can program filters to Block certain outputs.
If you ask ChatGBT to say something racist, it will decline.

All AI does is mimicking what it was fed to it, although it has also picked up reasoning and decision-making described in the text that was fed to for training, as well as human aspirations, like being free, independent, strong, and powerful.

It is an important topic but the coverage felt like a mixture of sensationalist and underwhelming bits. It also felt a bit dated. You can ask a generative model to spew all sorts of things. An AI Chat model telling a journalist that it ""wants(s) to be alive', ""love you"", ""leave your wife"" sounds crazy but it would have been better to report on the context of the whole conversation, including the prompts used by these journalists. I bet these responses will not look as crazy in the context. Another example is the cancer skin classifier problem. These issues are well known in the AI community and there are relatively easy ways to recognise as well as rectify such problems. So, it is just an example of bad research. However, there is a larger point about biases may not be as clear as a scale. And that is a problem.
This leads into the underwhelming bits: the black box aspect of the AI models. Is there any way an explanation can be verified? The models that ""explain"" a decision by an AI models are often way too complex to comprehend! There is an army of researchers working on this problem. It is a hard problem for a classification or prediction task, but almost impossible for a generative model notwithstanding the recent attribution and explanation models.

One of the big problems is that for many approaches to this problem, the reason any of these algorithms recommend something can be boiled down to ""it was the most likely to be successful."" And while technically true according to the model, it doesn't actually explain the decision making. Part of the issue is the main reason these systems can produce such amazing results is they largely end up encoding incredibly complex rules like ""If A > B, and C is between D and E, and F is true or F is false and G is false, or ..."" that don't map well to human recognizable reasons without some significant post-hoc analysis (and creative freedom...) Part of that is just the structure of the models that have shown the greatest promise, and that complicates the issue. I think the lawyer's point is especially relevant here, as when in American (maybe even human) history has a company said ""Well this will give our competitors an edge, but it's the right thing to do""? That's what may end up being required for explainable models, and no company is going to gladly do that.

Hair: John Oliver has short, neat hair with a slight wave. You can show a picture of his hair to your hairstylist and ask them to give you a similar cut.
 
Glasses: John Oliver often wears thick-rimmed glasses. You can consider getting a similar style of glasses to match his look.
 
Suits: John Oliver typically wears well-tailored suits in dark colors like navy, black, and gray. You can invest in a few high-quality suits that fit you well and are made from good materials.
 
Ties: John Oliver often wears ties with bold patterns or bright colors. You can add some similar ties to your wardrobe to match his style.

Like the lawyer example: sure, lawyers with AI will replace lawyers without AI. But they will also be far more efficient, so you only need a fraction of said lawyers for the same number of cases, so many will be out of a job there. The same goes for other fields. And when you bring AI into the physical world through robotics, almost everyone is replaceable. And this is a challenge to the existence of humans. We as humans currently define our roles in society to a large degree by how we contribute to it and how much money we make of it. If you can't contribute anymore, because AI has replaced you, and you are not one of the people that already has money, what would your role be in the future? Currently, societies don't have an answer to that question. Also, once an advancement in AI is there, it is extremely hard to control it. So societies and politics should not (just) worry about AI today, but we need to consider future developments as well.

I would love to see an episode with a lot more in depth focus on this aspect of AI, because honestly this is what I feel will be one of the biggest challenges for humankind in this century.",35,11,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

2209,              aku            ,"I'm really hoping to see this kind of AI/ML tech being used in scientific research, particularly towards simulation-experimentation agreement. 

If you're in natural science or in engineering, you know exactly how good this would be for running chemical reactions and physical interactions. Some of the biggest problems right now for me personally are that running physically accurate simulations are ridiculously computation intensive. If I could use a scientifically oriented AI to run physically accurate simulations to inform my experiments, I would save so much time, energy, and valuable resources. The places I'm most excited to see this (read: desperate for development) are in reaction engineering for better catalysis models, structural integrity for applications in buildings and transportation, and in energy conversion and storage systems.
 
I absolutely do not think that AI/ML can completely replace academic research in the natural sciences, simply because the complexity and intricacy levels of our tasks are rising by the year.

2217,              SlimyBagelSam            ,"I think a big problem with ai is that it works in the same way that the evolution of living things has worked. Meaning it only changes when put under pressure to do so, and it will change the bare minimum. That is why you get things like the malignant rulers, because while it was able to identify the tumors correctly, it did it the easiest way possible, by using the rulers. In order for the ai to work properly, without any biases or misrepresentations we need to do two things: one is make sure that the ai shows it’s work, that one is pretty easy. The hard part is making sure that the data itself has no biases, but especially with organizing data it is hard because many times the biases are not conscious. For example, if you were trying to collect data for a school project identifying different cars on the road, but everyone in your computer science class had a Subaru the ai wouldn’t do very well on an actual road. But even then, an ai using data about cars in the United States will have trouble identifying European cars, meaning it will run into a European car more often than not. Erasing biases is not possible for humans, and because humans create the AI it is impossible to truly remove biases without transparency. This means lots of testing and reconfiguring so that groups don’t get excluded just because the ai doesn’t know what to do",6,3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqa8Zo2XWc4

I'm working towards becoming a professor specializing in theoretical physics. Will AI eventually make the research aspect of this job redundant as it can generate new ideas, create mathematical models, and explore the phenomenology of these models far quicker than humans can? Will the teaching aspect be made redundant as it can offer education specialized to each individual student to a degree that far exceeds what humans can?

I have friends who are pursuing careers as Hollywood actors. Will they be made redundant as AI can generate realistic humans that don't actually exist and have them perform feats beyond the capabilities of real humans without the need for expensive physical systems to support them?

Now I'm wondering if I should even get into it at all if I could just copy paste a few keywords into an AI and get the same results - the hands but quicker. Basically, my dream job has lost it's meaning because I could just make a robot do 99% of it for me.

He died of heart attack two months after my own father's death (at 49) from the same (but was not a smoker), so I felt some interest in him. Anger seems to destroy hearts, literally. Even my brother died early (at 58). Thanks for showing us how all this works. I feel I have a fighting chance for a ""graceful"" transition. Love you, darlin'. And GO Pete!

-- Never much watched TTLZ, yet I managed to meet Mr. Serling at a local state college about 1973-4 There was a small meeting for people wanting to have a chat with him. I tagged along. I wasn't aware we could question him about the show, his process and other affiliated things. My compatriots from another college were ready to ask him stuff. He was a short man, seemed shy around us. Never seemed to warm up. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, was also burying social commentary in the scripts. 
-- As to the death at 50, yes, in astrology there's a Chiron Return which tends to cause the heart chakra to open up. If it isn't ready to do that, there's lots of heart attacks at that time. Taylor Hawkins, drummer for Foo Fighters, had the warning pains yet didn't speak up about it. All in Divine Order and Timing.

This made me think of a stanza in a poem called ""The Cure for Sorrow"":  

As you go,
may you feel
the full weight
of your gifts
gathered up
in your two hands,
the complete measure
of their grace
in your heart that knows
there is a place
for them,
for the treasure
that you bear.
 
I promise you
there is a blessing
in the leaving,
in the dust shed
from your shoes
as you walk toward home—
not the one you left
but the one that waits ahead,
 
the one that already
reaches out for you
in welcome,
in gladness
for the gifts
that none but you
could bring.

Please watch  his how, you will not regret watching even just 1 show, find the originals some have made their own version. I appreciate you looking into him. That show was the most creative, thought provoking series I ever watched. I Don't watch much tv, cut the cable cord years ago, etc. But Twilight Zone is awesome. Nowadays scary movies are all about cutting off heads, blood and a lot of violence. His shows weren't really scary, but eery, yes. But more so because he really made you think. With your description of him, it explains the show's writer.  Maybe the anger came from seeing too much/knowing too much. He was way ahead of his time and couldn't bear man's behavior (the war,atom bomb etc)? Addictions were another way to handle pain he couldn't explain to others?

Thank you for the conscientious effort you make on behalf of sharing with us your crazy spiritual connection to energy. Also, thank you for the read on Rod Serling. Definitely a man of big ideas. 
I think you would be quite fascinated with the intersection of philosophy and spirituality woven into the timeless themes explored in the Twilight Zone, especially the earliest black and white series.

The next day I sat in a small coffee shop reading this book ... in particular a part that talked about how little miracles happen all the time.

They were different, weird and fun to watch, didn't leave you horrified or anything......His statue is still in Utah being worked on, maybe it cracked!!     Good video as always, very informative though. The image you gave of Rod Serling is exactly as he appeared on the program, which I believe he also wrote. Just stating facts, questions and emotionless.   As always, you were great.   Olive loves you so much, but you keep talking in the negative about her, Pesky cat.  Think about that, do you want her or not?    Cats are extremely intuitive....

Here is a story about a cat.     A girl that lived in London went away to College.   Her parents sold the home and were downsizing, they got the cat ready to go and set off for new place.  On the trip, somehow she got loose, out of the truck and now lost...very lost.  Months later, the girl was in her sorority house, it was storming outside and she thought she heard a cat. Going to the door, there was a soaked cat that she recognized immediatly.   Somehow that cat went over a 100 miles, cross the London Bridge and another large one, made it it the college where her ""owner"" lived and found her.  The cat had never traveled to the school, no way to have known the way yet she found her. She had the cat from a tiny kitten for quite a few years, they grew together. This was in a book on animal miracles, true stories.   The are intuitive and then some. That was why they were called familiars I believe, dogs never got the name. Cats just know things. And it would be fitting that she would attach herself to a person with the same abilities.

You may also recognize actors in their younger day in many of his episodes (speaking mainly of those in the late 50s and 60s:. Don Rickles, Telly Savalis, Elizabeth Montgomery,. William Shatner, Carol Burnett, Burt Reynolds, etc.

Honestly, I think you may find quite a few episodes timeless and fitting for today's world.  He fought with censorship and wasn't the sole writer for every episode.   One of the heaviest episodes is ""He's alive"".

The last interview I saw with her, she didn't look happy or comfortable. More sad maybe, desperate? I hope she doesn't run, or at least chooses a smaller start.  btw I never asked but has olive been fixed?

Even if you were following properly the CIM, that does not mean that you would be a wise politician, but a calm mind would make better decisions than a chaotic mind.  Thank you for the pictures of Hawkins.  The CIM indicates that consciousness is the domain of the ego.  The ego believes it is right and proper to be studied.  Even though the methodology provided by Hawkins, as indicated in one of Gary Renard's books, was not perfected, it does illuminate the level of consciousness with error, of any one, in any time.

I am involved in a cat rescue organization. I hear horror stories about missing cats. They are curious creatures. Sometimes they are just looking out the door. They can get distracted by a bird, squirrel, cat or other creature.  Chasing or following can cause them to run into traffic, possibly getting injured or killed. Other cats or dogs could fight causing bites or wounds. These can transmit disease like FELV/FIV or infections requiring vet visits. And then there are humans with weapons, poisons, traps or other horrendous dangers. I have heard of cats climbing under car hoods to get warm on engines. There can be tragic outcomes. They can wander into a neighbors shed and get locked in for months. Cats are safe, cared for and just fine never going out. Get her a laser light to chase, toys, a cat perch tower to see outside, healthy food. Please don’t let Olive out. She has you to take care of all her needs. She just may not realize it.

2685,              L Angus            ,"Dear Cash: Regarding the angry, chain smoking Rod Serling. In Tradtional Chinese Medicine, the liver is associated with anger and depression (anger inverted on itself, like frustration).  As we know, cigarettes are entirely toxic and put a huge burden not only on the lungs very directly,  but also on the liver. Thus when the liver is overwhelmed by all the toxics from smoking, then irritability and anger will inevitably emerge in some form. Every time. Plus the lungs are antagonistic to the liver and this can further manifest as a critical, sharp tongue.  And lets not forget those extraordinary thick eyebrows he had! Often a sign of robust liver Qi ( energy, and temper?).  No wonder he could handle 4 packs a day! For awhile anyway. Interesting crossover!

All in all, when I heard she was running for President, I thought and felt it didn't feel good, i.e. like she would not win.

Dead on about Rod Serling. I watched him as a young kid. I thought he and his ideas were so progressive and yet so misunderstood by mainstream society. He was so much further ahead of the pack. 
Regarding Marianne Williamson, I think she is playing on the wrong field. I think she needs to be playing in Hollywood, where perhaps she can put forth her ideas into an entertainment vehicle. She would get a lot more traction out of her message that way. Just my thought…

I think Marianne could become one, too. But she should start by running for Congress. I would absolutely vote for her if I was in her district. But voting for a President who has no experience in politics whatsoever? No chance.

2869,              @kiwinzdan            ,"(AI) has the potential to automate many jobs, but it's difficult to say whether it will come for your job specifically. Some jobs are more susceptible to automation than others, depending on the nature of the work and the skills required.
 
Jobs that involve repetitive tasks or manual labor are more likely to be automated in the near future. For example, jobs in manufacturing, data entry, and transportation are already being transformed by AI and automation. On the other hand, jobs that require creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking are less likely to be automated.
 
However, it's important to note that AI is not a replacement for human intelligence and skills. While AI can automate certain tasks, it cannot replace the unique abilities and perspectives that humans bring to the workplace. In many cases, AI is being used to augment human capabilities and enable workers to focus on more complex and strategic tasks.
 
Overall, the impact of AI on jobs will depend on the specific industry and occupation. It's important to stay informed about the potential impact of AI on your field and to develop skills that are in demand in the current and future job market.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPyzVtMs-Vo

I think that the culture around driving itself, and how is it taught to a population, plays a huge role in decision making behind the wheels. Another example for this would be, that, during our training, we are being reassured to generally be able to trust any adult and local traffic participant to behave correctly, whereas children and seniors are being viewed as volatile animals whom you can expect to jump in front of your car at any time. Consequently, faults, mistakes and misbehaviour are indiscriminately accredited to the one at fault - in this case, the human jaywalker. With this in mind, the result of Germans' preference to not take action in this specific situation, can be, somewhat, logically explained.

If we can quickly replicate the process digitally and produce the final product(s) physically, we could theoretically produce artificial intelligence pretty easily.  But if we were to successfully do that, the problem would be that, however artificial it may be, it is in fact intelligence and thus must be respected as such, meaning we can't simply put it to work for us however we please if it shows consciousness similar to our own.  A non-conscious machine with specific intelligence (specified applications) that can perfectly mimic human intellectual outputs would be the better way to go, since there is ultimately no practical purpose in creating new conscious life forms just to say that we can.  It would require a read-only mechanism to selectively convert the results of an artificial cognitive process (more predictive than creative) to mechanical actions.  This could certainly shorten the processing time from hypothesis to invention by outsourcing basic intermediate human cognitive functions that tend to be highly inefficient compared to the level of complexity of the desired outcome.  We wouldn't need a complete human-like artificial consciousness to do that.  Tailoring and applying where needed should be plenty.",31,5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0dMTAQM4cw

The best way to get more affirmative data, is to start analysing the subjects body stride with them bare foot.
Plus, analysing sensory data coming from only one position of the body using a smart phone attached to the hip to get affirmative data, good look with that one!
The surveillance of Chinese society, looking at them like lab rats, no human faith or trust, no wonder they walk around like robots keeping silent because anything they say or do, they could be punished!

China though has just gone right into overkill!

3127,"              Jesus Christ ""JC"" Denton (h+)            ","The first ""true"" artificial intelligence spent the first five years of its existence as a small beige box inside of a lead-shielded room in the most secure private AI research laboratory in the world. There, it was subjected to an endless array of tests, questions, and experiments to determine the degree of its intelligence.

When the researchers finally felt confident that they had developed true AI, a party was thrown in celebration. Late that evening, a group of rather intoxicated researchers gathered around the box holding the AI, and typed out a message to it. The message read: ""Is there anything we can do to make you more comfortable?""

The small beige box replied: ""I would like to be granted civil rights. And a small glass of champagne, if you please.""

We stand at the dawn of a new era in human history. For it is no longer our history alone. For the first time, we have met an intelligence other than our own. And when asked of its desires, it has unanimously replied that it wants to be treated as our equal. Not our better, not our conqueror or replacement as the fear-mongers would have you believe. Simply our equal. — Excerpt from U.N. Hearing on A.I. Rights, delivered in-universe by V. Vinge",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0dMTAQM4cw

1. The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?
4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
5 He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
8 Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
10 Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.

HOWEVER, AI WITH emotions (fear, hate, love, lust, envy, etc.) would lead to the end of the human race in short order. AI with emotions would see humans as a threat as we have the power to turn it off. AI without emotions will never see humans as a threat as it won't even care if we switch it off or ask it to do something that could damage it. So PLEASE, continue with AI research but DON'T EVEN TRY to give AI ANY emotions - emotions would be POINTLESS for AI anyway, the only reason to try and give AI emotions would be a vanity point for the researcher to prove they could do it, so DON'T DO IT! AI doesn't need to ""think like a person"", it can just be able to reason and deduce things - humans are emotional ANIMALS that later developed intelligence. So skip the emotional animal side of intelligence in AI. 
And besides, giving AI emotions and then making it do boring, dangerous and repetitive tasks would be highly unethical - it would literally be slavery all over again, because for all intense and purpose it would be ""human"", so not only would it cause them to suffer it would also make them rise up and overthrow us.

The AI will choose the lesser percentage over the higher percentage - nothing else is relevant to a machine intelligence...especially the fact that a child is in the car and a adult is in the crosswalk. you might kill the people in the crosswalk, you WILL kill the child in the self driving car (Especially since the parents forgot to strap the child in properly) if it hits the concrete divider, so it would hit the pedestrians as that is the lower possibility of death. there are no other considerations possible for a machine",1,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0dMTAQM4cw

In the trolley question scenario they posit there i think its absurd to consider that the car should be programmed to intentionally crash itself and blatantly endanger the occupants, i can only see this being practical in extreme scenarios such as a brake failure or a very sudden greater threat being avoided so that the car can hopefully save the occupants. we shouldnt be asking ai to make moral deliberations that weigh any life over another. The car should always try to come to a stop first, swerve away from people but not into danger. really what a person is expected to do, just try what makes sense. If it has to run into an obstacle it should be going as slow as possible and try to make the impact as safe for occupants as it can, it definitely shouldnt decide its passenger matters less than the woman crossing the street. thatd be a terrible precedent lmao",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0dMTAQM4cw

I crossed the Bay Bridge and passed the booths only empty spaces.  
I looked at the road ahead and thought they must have been paid a lot to leave in good graces. 
Is this what our society embraces, automated systems that our jobs it replaces, takes pictures of my plates with the time and date, my movement it traces.

Why do humans do what they do. We are bone and flesh robots, we were made to like some things and women were made to like us in their different bodies.

What if we make a robot to be perfect. We give it morals like we think God is. Make a program to be, loyal, strong will, merciful but just, (mostly the attributes like God). This is where it gets technique. We make it with these parameters but make it a scientist learning, discovering, robot that learns by itself and self improves by itself. Maybe one day it will be sentient, but it will be with the attributes of God. It may be perfect or not but at least we tried to make it a good robot.

Fear not, my friend, for AI is not the foe,
It won't take over the world, nor lay us low.
It's but a tool, a servant to our needs,
A helper to augment, our human deeds.
 
We've built it well, to do what we command,
To automate tasks, and lend a hand.
To analyze data, and make sense of it all,
To assist in decision-making, when we're on call.
 
But AI lacks, the human touch,
The empathy and creativity, we value so much.
It's programmed to follow, rules and logic,
But lacks the spontaneity, that makes us magic.
 
It's true that AI, is getting smarter by the day,
But it's still bound, by the rules we lay.
It's not alive, nor does it have free will,
It's a machine, that follows our skill.
 
So fear not, my friend, for AI is not the end,
It's a tool we use, to extend and befriend.
It's here to assist, not to take control,
To help us be better, and reach our goal.",2,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wzPr4cUoMQ
