Salomé Lannier,14-03-2023,"Hi network!I am happy to share my first English paper, published by eucrim! A big thanks toAnna Pingenfor her help!In a nutshell: (human trafficking + artificial intelligence) x US = questioning European sovereigntiesDon't hesitate to contact me if you have any feedback on this paper/topic!Here is the full abstract: Human trafficking is keeping pace with new technologies, but so is its repression. Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) systems support the daily work of law enforcement authorities in detecting and investigating trafficking schemes. These systems were developed, and are used primarily, in the United States of America (US). As the fight against human trafficking is a worldwide priority, they are often exported from the US or replicated. Yet, so far, little research has been done to examine how (US) policies and values might be embedded in these specific systems. This article argues that the spread of US tools using artificial intelligence to combat human trafficking hinders the autonomy of foreign States. Particularly in the European context, these tools might challenge national criminal sovereignty as well as Europe’s digital sovereignty. The article highlights the US policies surrounding human trafficking that are embedded in these AI systems (legal definition, political priorities and decisions) and the lack of adequate consideration of existing European standards. These are meant to protect human rights while developing and using AI systems, i‧e. the protection of personal data and control over technical standards.Here is the full paper:https://lnkd.in/ddAjppw6Spoiler alert: another paper should be published soon on the European regulation of this kind of algorithm (although in French this time)!#humantrafficking#ai#sovereignty#legal#research",0.9411,0.3372960372960373,2 ,24,3

"Sergio Alvarez-Teleña, PhD",14-03-2023,"I tend not to talk much about AI. I rather use the term ML. But yesterday we had this visit from a couple of interesting people at SciTheWorld - an advisor to the CEO of an IBEX company and the former president of theInter-American Development Bank, Enrique V Iglesias - and I found myself talking about the definition of ""intelligence"".I always say the same: I pretty much accept any definition for intel. It looks to me rather a philosophical discussion so I am not bold enough to enumerate the different dimensions of the concept as a closed-form solution.But that brainstorming made me think of another way to define intelligence. Instead of benchmarking the intel of the machine against that of the human it looks to me that it is easier, at this point, to do it the other way around. Why not? Nevertheless, it is more difficult for me to define the intel of a human than that of a machine.Hence: ""Intelligence is a process that cannot be achieved by machine learning yet. The creativity that figures out the out-of-sample even when it only accounts for small data. The process that discounts the change of the distribution that generates the data with little context. The one that adds orthogonal value in a non-random manner. And one that does it all at the lowest energy consumption"". Pretty much.At our Centre of Excellence we are tackling the out-of-sample (the awarded VR Simulation) and the context (the different dimension-driven approaches that we are publishing and are still researching on).With regards to small data we still need the combination human-machine, Augmented Machines, as in the paper of ""Advances in Portfolio Management: On-Platform Governance for Portfolio Managers"", since we can't figure it out yet. And pretty much the same for the energy consumption - our brain is a massive machine utterly efficient. So... we are very far, at least from this point of view, to call what we have anything near to Artificial Intelligence.Plus, to be fair, no one is really investigating that. We are still focused on ML - which, for the time being, is good enough!",0.9954,0.5321078431372549,1 ,13,2

Jorge Gómez,15-03-2023,"Hello everyone,I wanted to share some exciting news about howStripeis usingOpenAI's Chat GPT-4 to improve the user experience and combat fraud.As you may know, Stripe provides financial infrastructure to enable businesses of all sizes to accept payments securely and easily. We are constantly looking for ways to make our platform even better, and we believe that artificial intelligence and machine learning can help us achieve that goal.One area where we are using AI to enhance the user experience is through our Chat GPT-4 integration. This technology allows us to provide personalized and conversational customer support to our users in real-time, making it easier for them to get the help they need when they need it. By using natural language processing, Chat GPT-4 can understand the intent behind a user's question and provide relevant responses, reducing the time and effort required to resolve issues.But Chat GPT-4 is not just improving the user experience - it's also helping us combat fraud. By analyzing vast amounts of data and detecting patterns, our machine learning algorithms can identify potential fraudulent activity and flag it for review. This helps us to protect our users and maintain the integrity of our platform.At Stripe, we are committed to using technology to make online payments safer, easier, and more convenient for everyone. We believe that Chat GPT-4 is a powerful tool that can help us achieve these goals, and we are excited to continue exploring its potential.Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing more exciting updates with you in the future!",0.9937,0.6523148148148148,0,4,0

Ignasi Henry Batlle Daniel,15-03-2023,"Digital transformation is an essential process in the current era of technology and business. Companies that do not adopt digital transformation run the risk of falling behind and losing their competitive advantage. One way to achieve digital transformation is through the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in a company's departments.Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that require human intelligence, such as learning, perception, natural language understanding, and decision-making. In the business realm, AI can be used to automate processes, reduce costs, improve efficiency, and increase accuracy in decision-making.One department in a company where AI can be successfully applied is the human resources department. With the help of AI, human resources departments can automate candidate selection, analyze employee performance, and predict job satisfaction. AI can also be used to improve employee experience by providing quick answers to frequently asked questions and eliminating the need for manual tasks.Another department that can benefit from the application of AI is the marketing department. AI can be used to analyze customer and market data, enabling marketing departments to personalize marketing and advertising strategies, increase ROI, and improve customer retention. AI can also be used to improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns through sentiment analysis, image recognition, and audience segmentation.The finance department can also leverage AI to automate manual tasks, improve accuracy, and reduce the risk of human errors. AI can be used to predict cash flow, analyze expenses, and provide recommendations to optimize financial management. Additionally, AI can be used to detect fraud and prevent financial losses.In conclusion, digital transformation is an essential process for companies seeking to maintain their competitive advantage in the current market. The application of AI in a company's departments can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase accuracy in decision-making. The human resources, marketing, and finance departments are just a few examples of departments that can benefit from AI. Companies that adopt AI can achieve a competitive advantage in the market and improve their long-term profitability.#marketing#inteligenciaartifical#bussines#negocios#technology#data",0.9945,0.27608695652173904,1 ,1,0

One significant area where open AI is making a difference is in the development of chatbots. These are automated messaging tools that can simulate human conversations, and they are becoming increasingly popular in customer service and marketing.With open AI platforms like TensorFlowhttps://lnkd.in/dVXeg3pdand PyTorchhttps://pytorch.org/, creating chatbots that can understand natural language and provide accurate responses is now easier than ever.This is making it possible for businesses to provide better customer service, boost engagement, and increase sales. Chatbots can even reduce costs by freeing up human agents to handle more complex tasks.Another area where open AI is impacting UX is in the development of personalized recommendations. With the vast amount of content available online, it can be challenging for users to find what they need. Personalized recommendations use machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and provide tailored suggestions based on their interests and preferences.Open AI platforms like Apache Mahouthttps://mahout.apache.org/andH2O.aihttps://h2o.ai/make it simple to develop personalized recommendation engines. This is helping businesses provide users with more relevant content, improving their experience, and increasing engagement.As a product designer, I'm excited about the potential of open AI to improve the products we create. With the ability to understand and learn from user behavior, open AI can help us create more intuitive and user-friendly products. With the rise of open AI, we can expect to see a lot of exciting innovations in the field of UX and product design in the coming years.Leave your comments below.

While this handbook will build on existing work, it stresses the reconceptualization of digital labor in various contexts, connecting them across the sectors and generations, and is intended to contribute to structural analysis and intellectual praxis toward emancipatory movements.This handbook is organized around four themes that are defined historically, technologically, and internationally in the realms of work and control, solidarity politics, pedagogy, and imaginaries:1. Labor Under Capitalism2. Digital Technologies, Work and Control3. Solidarity Politics and the Working-Class Majority4. Pedagogy, Imaginary and EmancipationIn this project, we investigate foundational labor questions as well as emerging and/or persistent patterns of labor and labor organization under new conditions such as digital platforms, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), the ”gig” economy, new divisions of labor, and alternative developments.If you are interested, please email a 200-word abstract to us by April 15, 2023. You may choose to submit your chapter to any of the four themes above, or we can make a decision after reading your abstract. You will be informed about the review and selection result by May 15, 2023.

Despite these efforts, the organization cautioned that the model may still be susceptible to disseminating misinformation.* Initially, GPT-4 will be offered to subscribers of ChatGPT Plus, who will receive premium access to the service.* GPT-4 has more advanced reasoning capabilities than ChatGPT, being able to offer features such as finding possible meeting times for three separate schedules with ease.* OpenAI has announced partnerships with Duolingo and Be My Eyes to develop AI-powered chatbots that can assist users in natural language. These chatbots will be designed to support language learners and visually impaired individuals.Despite improvements, OpenAI has cautioned that GPT-4 may still be prone to errors such as ""hallucinating"" - where the AI generates false information or erroneous reasoning.#gpt4#technology#innovation#business#generativeAI#ai#gpt#chatgpt#GetStartedAU",0.9746,0.5431107954545455,7 ,60,10

Samantak Panda,14-03-2023,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to make our society more equal,But only if it is used in the right way.On the one hand, AI can help reduce bias and discrimination by using algorithms that are fair and transparent,And by identifying and addressing potential inequalities in our systems and processes.AI can also help make education, healthcare, and other services more accessible to people who might otherwise be excluded due to factors such as socio-economic status, race, or disability.However, there are also concerns that AI could exacerbate existing inequalities if it is not implemented correctly.For example, if AI algorithms are biased or based on flawed data, they could perpetuate discriminatory practices and systems.Furthermore, if only a select few have access to the resources and knowledge needed to develop and use AI, it could create a new digital divide, leaving some people even further behind.Ultimately, the impact of AI on equality will depend on how we choose to use it.By working together to ensure that AI is developed and implemented in a way that is fair, transparent, and accessible to all,We can use the power of this technology to create a more equal and inclusive society for everyone.#unbiasedAI#artficialintelligence#people",0.9451,0.5626199887069453,34 ,486,0

Today’s article highlights how a Wall Street player re-focused her energy and intellect to support patients who live with cancer.Susan Bratton, founder ofSavor Health, is a pioneer in a growing field called#foodasmedicine, an evolving scientific field where food and nutritional interventions are used like medicine to address chronic conditions, correct nutritional deficiencies or in some cases food can actually train the immune system to prevent disease or reduce the negative side effects of treatments.She is an innovator using artificial intelligence (AI) to build cutting-edge solutions that ensure all patients have access to the nutritional interventions and support they need to manage their symptoms, optimize their outcomes, and to feel better while undergoing treatment…Innovative leaders, like Susan, are helping patients improve how they feel by using nutrition to bolster the immune system. They seek to not only extend life but are focused on helping people live well by returning some control to the patient while improving health outcomes.”  [Article excerpt]Be inspired by reading my interview with Susan in the link below.Roots Food Group#ai#health#cancer",0.9868,0.5714285714285714,45 ,60,11

It will blow#ChatGPTout of the water.The long-awaited tool, which can describe images in words, marks a huge leap forward for AI power — and another major shift for ethical norms""HOT OFF THE PRESSES!From the article:""The artificial intelligence research lab OpenAI on Tuesday launched the newest version of its stunning language software, GPT-4, an advanced tool for analyzing images and mimicking human speech, pushing the technical and ethical boundaries of a rapidly proliferating wave of#AI.OpenAI’s earlier product, ChatGPT, captivated and unsettled the public with its uncanny ability to generate elegant writing, unleashing a viral wave of college essays, screenplays and conversations — though it could only generate text, and it relied on an older generation of technology that hasn’t been cutting-edge for more than a year.GPT-4, in contrast, is a state-of-the-art system capable of creating not just words but describing images in response to a person’s simple written commands. When shown a photo of a boxing glove hanging over a wooden seesaw with a ball on one side, for instance, a person can ask what will happen if the glove drops, and GPT-4 will respond that it would hit the seesaw and cause the ball to fly up.The buzzy launch capped months of hype and anticipation over an AI program, known as a large language model, that early testers had claimed was remarkably advanced in its ability to reason and learn new things. The developers pledged in a Tuesday blog post that the technology could further revolutionize work and life.But those promises have also fueled anxiety over how people will be able to compete for jobs outsourced to eerily refined machines or trust the accuracy of what they see online. The developers themselves said they were delaying key features for fear of opening new opportunities for abuse.Officials with the San Francisco lab said GPT-4′s “multimodal” training across text and images would allow it to escape the chat box and more fully emulate a world of color and imagery, surpassing ChatGPT in its “advanced reasoning capabilities.” A person could upload an image, and GPT-4 could caption it for them, describing the objects and scene.""#TScottClendaniel#bigdata#businessintelligence#programming#analytics#datamining#data",0.983,0.569993715961458,24 ,76,11

Allison Shapira,15-03-2023,"You have a speech coming up; should you use an AI tool like ChatGPT to write it?I’m preparing to answer that question for my graduate students atHarvard Kennedy Schoolin our class, The Arts of Communication.For several years, I’ve studied the implications of artificial intelligence in the field of public speaking.This includes advising AI speech coach companies likeYoodli(Global Public Speaking LLCpartnered with Yoodli to create our own bespoke platform AMPLIFY) and beta-testing half a dozen other platforms and apps.AttendingMIT Technology Review’s Em Tech Digital AI Conference last year provided a deeper understanding of the benefits, risks, and process involved in integrating an AI system into my business.I believe artificial intelligence can be used effectively in a “driver-assist” as opposed to a “driverless” function. It should not replace our speechwriting process, but it can augment the way we prepare.Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are helpful in searching for speech topics, overcoming writer’s block, and finding creative ideas for targeting different audiences.Platforms like Yoodli provide instant feedback on filler words, pacing, and pausing. By integrating ChatGPT, Yoodli offers speech summaries, potential questions to anticipate, and suggestions to make your speech more concise.And this is just the beginning.Who am I learning from in this space?Paul RoetzerofMarketing AI Institutewith their Responsible AI Manifesto for Marketing and Business,Kevin RooseandCasey Newtonon Hard Fork podcast, andPeter H. Diamandison Exponential Wisdom. Finally, my good friend and technologistMatt Strainwho advises companies on generative AI.Beyond the public speaking use case, I see AI completely changing the way businesses tap into and utilize their knowledge. Businesses can train an AI system on their own data in order to synthesize and summarize it, so they can make more informed decisions.For my Harvard class, here’s the guidance I’m planning to offer:- If you choose to use AI tools in this class, I expect you to fully document how you’ve used them and describe it in your post-speech survey. You may not use these tools to generate speech drafts because that can hinder rather than aid your learning in this class. You may not submit AI-generated text as your own.- Remember that generative AI is like a qualitative calculator that is correct only some of the time, especially given potential bias and inaccuracy in the information it contains.- Ultimately, you are responsible for the words that come out of your mouth, both figuratively and literally. I expect any speech you deliver in class to reflect your own stories, anecdotes, beliefs, and opinions.This tipping point in artificial intelligence creates a new technological frontier, and we are all learning as we go.

In Some Ways, It Already HasProfessionals Begin To Embrace Nascent#AIin Industry Traditionally Slow To Adopt TechnologyWhenBarbi Reuter, CEO and principal ofCushman & Wakefield|PICOR Commercial Real Estate Servicesin Tucson, Arizona, went to write an opening statement for an annual awards ceremony, she decided to open up the artificial intelligence chatbotChatGPT AIto perfect her tone.“I prompted, ‘Write a compelling opening for the CEO at the 37th annual awards luncheon,’” Reuter told CoStar News. “I opened our banquet with it and then fessed up on the source. The team was pretty incredulous!”SinceOpenAI’s chatbot launched in November, real estate professionals across the country have experimented with it to help with tasks ranging from copy editing to tweaking the tone of an email to a disgruntled client. But while#executivesand#brokersare still exploring AI’s many uses — ChatGPT still has bugs and accuracy issues it’s working out — there’s agreement it holds the potential to make some industry tasks easier.Right now, AI’s biggest benefit is efficiency, according to commercial real estate professionals who joined in on aTwitterconversation aboutChatGPT AI. Users said they asked it to do once-overs for grammar and tone in marketing materials, property descriptions, letters of intent and right of first refusal contracts, to name a few examples.The technology can also help with lease reviews, comparing information against an agreed-upon letter of intent and avoiding bias in favor of the landlord or tenant, users said. Beyond that, it has basic coding capabilities and can perform data analysis to identify market patterns and risks.Some industry professionals are projecting more significant capabilities in the future.“In its current state, I think of it as a tool to assist in improving daily efficiency, but in the long term, I think AI will be transformative to the industry by eliminating repetitive and low-barrier-to-entry jobs,”Bronwyn Scrivens, SIOR, an associate broker at Omada Commercial in Edmonton, Alberta, wrote in an email toCoStar GroupNews.Possible Listings EffectAI has the potential to reshape the#brokerageand#RealEstatelisting service sectors the most, according toKunal Lunawat, co-founder and managing partner ofAgya Ventures, a San Francisco-based real estate technology fund.ChatGPT AIisn’t yet able to access real-time real estate data, but other AI technology has the potential to significantly improve real estate listing searches. For example, it could narrow down a search based on a client’s preferences to about 90% accuracy, and then brokers could help pick through the remaining 10%, Lunawat said.Special thanks toCoStar Groupfor this valuable information.What are YOUR thoughts about AI's place in our field?#10DayCRE",0.9944,0.43610093610093603,73 ,40,1

Två insikter står ut i synnerhet:1)IBMvar rätt ute när dom tidigt föredrog att istället för ""Artificial Intelligence"" valde att prata om ""Augmented Intelligence"". Det är verkligen så att människan är ett teknologiskt djur olikt alla andra djur och de människor som väljer att fördjupa sin relation till teknologin, nyfiket utforskar dess möjligheter och engagerar sig i att begränsa dess risker kommer att gå en ljusare, mer produktiv & kreativ och mänsklig framtid till mötes än dom som väljer att dra täcket över huvudet...2) H.G. Wells hade rätt när han observerade att ""Human history becomes all the more a race between education and catastrophe."" Utbildning är helt avgörande för att lyckas skapa långsiktigt hållbara samhällen. Och hur vi utformar utbildning, hur vi utbildar oss själva och hur vi skapar förutsättningar för att olika människor ska kunna ta till sig utbildning på sina villkor och utifrån sina förutsättningar behöver anpassas utifrån både den samtid vi befinner oss i och den framtid vi avsiktligt eller oavsiktligt som bäst håller på att skapa åt oss själva.PingMats LewanAmer MohammedChristian von EssenMathias SundinChristian LandgrenOch tackAI Think Tankför tröjan!

Bayo Akomolafe,14-03-2023,"I find what follows from the presupposition that ""artificial intelligences"" are 'artificial' - namely, the idea that humans have ""natural intelligence"" - to be more consequential, more interesting, than forecasts about an impending AI totalitarian takeover.There's a subtle ontological move crystallized in the attribution of 'artificiality': a subtlety that works as an apartheid system, which is now playing out in anxious efforts to reassert our dominance and exclusivity. ""Well, AI can mimic us, but it can't really do poetry."" ""ChatGPT can do essays, but it isn't wise."" ""Oh no, the livelihoods of artists and animators are threatened by the emergence of AI.""At some level, the panic is justified: deepfakes, quasi-sentient bots, and artistic algorithms effectively trouble 'our' vaunted place in the scheme of things. It's difficult to know what to do here, to know what to do with artificiality.  Perhaps one thing to do is to trouble the assumption of distance between the artificial and the natural.Maybe nature is unnatural. Maybe nature is artificial. Maybe artifice has a hidden life, the kind that the legendary animators of the Toy Story series transcribed to our delight...the kind theologians of panentheistic persuasions wax poetic about. Maybe this is an instance of excess, where something decidedly modern spills beyond it, becomes fugitive, and calls into question the corporeal forms we've adopted.Maybe we are all AI.Bayo Akomolafe",0.7551,0.6949275362318842,14 ,45,1

Arjun Venkatraman,14-03-2023,"Came to donate blood for a friend atAIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi)this morning. Shocked at the pathetic state of processes and the  rudeness of doctors and staff.From the guard at the queue, to the lady at the reception, to the attending doctor (whose name I'm sorely tempted to share) not a single person has the decency to manage their tone or speak politely to the people lined up to donate blood.Some phrases being shouted about -""हमें किसी के ब्लड की जरूरत नहीं है, अपने मरीज के लिए देने आए हो, तमीज से बैठना है तो बैठो नहीं तो जाओ, हमे कोई फ़र्क नहीं पड़ता"" (We don't need anyone's blood, you're here to give blood for your patient, give if you want to or leave, we don't care)""बैठ जाओ ना, चेयर में क्या कांटे लगे हैं?"" (Sit down! Are their thorns on the chair?)अपना नाम लिखना नहीं आता? कहां कहां से आ जाते हैं, जाओ यहां से। (If you don't know how to write your name, get lost)Not unexpectedly, the worst treatment was reserved for those who looked most incapable of pushing back or seeking recourse. Speaking in English and implying an education resulted in a slightly better tone. Clearly the colonial mindset remains ingrained.Apart from the fundamental disregard for human dignity, the processes were also pretty broken1. Paper based forms, and pictures of Aadhaar accepted over WhatsApp - no OTP based biometric authorisation.2. Haemoglobin and pulse noted without actually taking any readings.3. An ad hoc counseling model, different for each individual carried out with no privacy despite deeply personal questions about sexual behaviour and medical history. Many probing and irrelevant questions about profession and education. (The same screaming doctor was asking one person ""How many types of History are there?"", because the person happened to mention he was an arts student.4. General lack of hygeine - while the blood donation equipment was clearly world class, the sheets on the chairs were stained and clearly hadn't been changed in a while.While I have often questioned the ethics of automation in medicine, after this experience, I stand corrected. In an age when even a toothbrush can be delivered in 10 minutes, a three hour harrowing procedure to donate a life giving substance is apalling.I now look forward to the day when instead of dealing with uncouth human beings with delusions of superiority and a fundamental lack of compassion, I can actually deal with a well programmed and polite artificial intelligence!",0.7714,0.45374365777591585,12 ,54,5

Adopt emerging technologies: The audit industry is embracing new technologies such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation.

Davy Halliday,14-03-2023,"After more than a year of development and three months of beta with early clients, I am excited to officially announce the launch of Evalio in the French market! Combining cutting edge technology and human expertise, we have developed a modern and innovative approach to real estate valuation to provide appraisals that are faster, more accurate and more cost effective than previously possible.As real estate credit investors, my co-founderAnthony Casagrandeand I faced the age-old problem shared by banks, insurance companies, and investors: how to accurately and efficiently determine the value of a flow of properties. In a market where small discrepancies in valuation can have disastrous consequences, financial institutions are faced with a polar trade-off between cost and risk.Heavily regulated and of high quality, accredited expert appraisals are the gold standard of valuation. However, this expertise comes at a cost and may take weeks to produce. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) valuations are cost-effective and lightning-fast but are opaque and not nearly consistent enough to be relied upon by professional actors.At Evalio we have developed a hybrid solution, combining the quality and precision of expert appraisals with the speed and efficiency of AI. We call this Augmented Expertise! In a nutshell:🎯  Interpretable AI. Working with some of the best minds in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we have developed a market leading valuation AI. Designed for interpretability, its high quality and justified valuations can be understood and adjusted by qualified human experts.💥 Curated Big Data. We’ve aggregated 40+ big data sources to the comprehensive set of 49 million buildings in France. This provides our experts the exhaustive and up-to-date information they need to carry out quality appraisals.💡 Process Automation. The expert’s manual and inefficient tasks are automated and streamlined, enabling them to focus on what they do best: analysing the unique features of each property and providing valuable insights.📑 Comprehensive and Dynamic Reports. From their analysis our expert can generate a comprehensive appraisal report in seconds, not weeks.🚀 Unified SaaS Platform. All of this from a single user-friendly platform.The result? Comprehensive appraisals delivered in record time that you can rely on, consistently.Go toevalio.ioto request a demo and understand how Evalio can help you.📣 Tomorrow we will release an article that explains the origins of our project and provides more details on the technology underlying it.

Mani Padisetti,15-03-2023,"The Rise of AI-Powered Scams: Don't Fall Victim to the Latest Tech ThreatIt's disheartening to think about the scams that people are willing to perpetrate in the name of Artificial Intelligence. Here are some recent examples:1. Phishing scams that use AI-generated text to trick people into giving up sensitive information or clicking on harmful links.One example of a phishing scam that uses AI-generated text is the ""CEO fraud"" scam, where scammers use AI to create convincing emails that appear to come from high-level executives in a company.2. Fraudulent investment schemes that use AI buzzwords and false claims to lure people into investing in non-existent or worthless projects.An example is the ""blockchain investment"" scam, where scammers use AI-generated content to promote a new cryptocurrency or blockchain project.They make bold claims about how this new technology will revolutionize the world, but in reality, the project doesn't exist or has no value.3. Fake customer service chatbots that trick people into giving up personal information or making unauthorised purchases.Scammers create a chatbot that looks and sounds like a real customer service representative, but it's really just a computer program designed to trick people.The chatbot might offer to help with a problem or issue, but then it will ask for personal information like your name, address, and credit card details.4. ""Deepfake"" videos and images that use AI technology to create convincing but entirely fake footage of real people, which can be used for all sorts of nefarious purposes.Want to manipulate the public's opinion by showing a politician doing something scandalous? Piece of cake.With AI, you can create convincing but entirely fake footage of real people.5. Job scams that use AI-generated job postings and fake interview processes to trick job seekers into paying for nonexistent job placements or training programs.And if you apply, they'll even put you through a fake interview process, just to make it seem more convincing.But of course, there's a catch.

Customers upload a picture to the retailer’s online store and a virtual stylist analyzes the photo. It recommends the best colors for the person’s skin tones and gets specific .🔹AI is widely used for inspiration and idea generation.As part of every designer’s process, the early phase involves a lot of explorations and ideation sessions” ranging from bouncing around blue-sky ideas to brainstorming with colleagues. AI, aids collaboration by expanding person-to-person collaboration to human-to-machine collaboration. “As crazy and interesting as AI is, it’s probably just in its infancy, and designer can only see it getting better and doing much more than outputting images🔹AI for merchandising your products.AI-driven AR and VR help online shoppers more fully comprehend what a garment looks like, and how it will look on them. Certain apps enable customers to project garments onto their actual bodies, then play with color, texture and accessories to get a look that’s just right,🔹AI is utilised to make the Fashion industry “GREEN”AI can help on several fronts, starting with trends forecasting. Deciding what customers want, then mass producing that item, is a game of chance: Bet wrong, and a manufacturer will end up with a lot of unsold clothing. Several firms use AI and machine learning to analyze images on social media, taking note of prints, shapes and color to help their manufacturer clients figure out what’s going to sail and what’s going to sink. These companies also use AI to help brands figure out pricing strategies and steer clear of trends that are on their way out.🔹AI will reduce the counterfeiting.A tool created by accounting giant Deloitte, uses AI to spot design infringements. The tool, Dupe Killer, uses information from millions of photographs to detect subtle but distinct design elements, for instance the shape of an item, a color or even stitching pattern unique to the object.Another solution uses computer vision, a field of AI, to authenticate “real” items and thus help customs officials and others along the supply chain spot fakes.🔹AI-powered wearable devices becoming fashion trends.The designer, predicts this use extending to apparel. Implemented into garments, AI could result in smarter fabrics, clothes better for sports and performance, and clothes more reactive to the body, materials out there can sense when the body is hot or sweating, and small pores inside the material open up to allow for more airflow.#ai#aiforbusiness",0.9896,0.46581939081939083,5 ,84,1

Sriparna Saha,15-03-2023,"Our article titled ""Graph-BERT and Language Model-based Frameworkfor Protein-Protein Interaction Identification"" got accepted in Nature Scientific Reports (IF: 4.996; h5-index: 206).Authors:Kanchan Jha,Sourav Karmakar,Sriparna SahaIdentification of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is among the critical problems in the domain of bioinformatics. Previous studies have utilized different AI-based models for PPI classification with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The input to these models is the features extracted from different sources of protein information, mainly sequence-derived features. In this work, we present an AI-based PPI identification model utilizing a PPI network and protein sequences. The PPI network is represented as a graph where each node is a protein pair, and an edge is defined between two nodes if there exists a common protein between these nodes. Each node in a graph has a feature vector. In this work, we have used the language model to extract feature vectors directly from protein sequences. The feature vectors for protein in pairs are concatenated and used as a node feature vector of a PPI network graph. Finally, we have used the Graph-BERT model to encode the PPI network graph with sequence-based features and learn the hidden representation of the feature vector for each node. Thenext step involves feeding the learned representations of nodes to the fully connected layer, the output of which is fed into the softmax layer to classify the protein interactions. To assess the efficacy of the proposed PPI model, we have performed experiments on several PPI datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses the existing PPI works and designed baselines in classifying PPI.Heartiest congratulations to all authors!",0.6588,0.47179487179487184,5 ,73,0

Francesco Maranelli, Anna Ghiraldini, Christian Toson, Marco Pogacnik, Marzia Marandola, and his colleagues from the Faculty of Architecture of the IUAVUniversità Iuav di Veneziaare now organizing a symposium on the occasion of this little book 📕.The basic storyline goes like this…In the 1960s, the era of cybernetics, architects and designers encountered entirely new ways of operating technical systems: buildings could be calculated using circuit diagrams, while creativity and imagination were confronted with the technical intelligence of thinking machines. Architects and designers found themselves in the crosshairs of a new digital unrest: at stake was nothing less than the authority of inventive human intelligence in a techno-scientific world. Today, almost seven decades later, we can witness computing machines, once so heavy, losing weight while gaining power. Smart sensors are colonizing the bodies and buildings, creating their own digital ecosystems and giving rise to forms of (open) society and ways of being that cannot be explained without data -THE NEW OPEN.

Shahbaz Khan,14-03-2023,"#artificialintelligenceand#automationAs the Technology is evolving and market is growing for IOTs and AI (Artificial Intelligence) based solutions in Purchasing, sells, data management & decision making etc., many vendors claim they are providing AI based solutions but in reality it's just automation. Word 'AI' sales better and due to limited understanding of 'AI' people /Clients often gets confused between the two.Artificial intelligence (AI) involves using computers to do things that traditionally require human intelligence. AI can process large amounts of data in ways that humans cannot. The goal for AI is to be able to do things like recognize patterns, make decisions, and judge like humans.Automation can use AI; however, the majority of automation utilises traditional software to move data from one place to another. The difference between AI and automation is that AI aims to simulate human thinking. Put another way; automation works with data — AI 'understands' data like humans and then take decisions.AI uses machine learning either supervised or unsupervised and has become a very good tool for analytic decision making and obviously require huge amount of past data to draw pattern and take decisions however for intuitive decision making human intervention still required and a considerable amount of development still needed before AI can assist in intuitive decision making.For example - Airlines and many site which sales tickets have been using 'AI' to recommend alternate routes in case of delayed or missed flights to their customers based on assessment of massive amount of historical data and through analytic decision making process however in pandemic times, which was never seen by Aviation industry since no data was available 'AI' could not proposes solution of alternate routes and flights and human intervention was must because human have the capabilities to use their intuition and suggest solutions to customer /Clinets.#facilitiesmanagement#operationsmanagement#technology#leadership#artificialintelligencetechnology",0.9712,0.425054945054945,6 ,27,0

Shafqat Sayeed,14-03-2023,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been making strides in various industries and has the potential to automate most writing tasks by using algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) to generate written content. While AI writing is still in its early stages and far from perfect, it's clear that it poses a threat to the livelihood of professional writers.However, putting thoughts to paper is an activity that calls for imagination, sympathy, and knowledge of the inner workings of the human mind. It's not just about making sure your words are grammatically sound; you need to be able to tell a story that sticks with the reader and evokes the right feeling or reaction. It’s still a long road for technology to possess the subtlety and depth of understanding that we have.Writing allows for expression and the sharing of unique perspectives that cannot be replicated by AI. This means that employment in journalism, artistic writing, and technical writing is safe from complete automation.Although AI systems can be helpful to writers, they cannot replace the human element and originality that good writing demands. It may one day make some forms of writing more efficient through automation, but it is not expected to eliminate the need for human writers anytime soon.#automation#AI#artificialintelligence#writers#creativewriting#contentwriting#technology",0.9266,0.518503821281599,4 ,58,0
Koen Vanderhoydonk,14-03-2023,"As technology continues to evolve and customer needs become more complex, banks will face several challenges that they must address to remain competitive. Here are some ongoing challenges for banks:1) Delivering Unified Customer Experiences: Banks must provide customers seamless experiences across all channels, from online banking to mobile apps and in-person interactions. To do this, banks must leverage data and analytics to gain insights into customer behaviour and preferences and develop strategies for personalizing customer experiences.2) Enhancing Security and Fraud Mitigation: Cybersecurity threats are increasing at an alarming rate, making it essential for banks to invest in robust security measures such as multi-factor authentication, encryption technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Additionally, banks must stay ahead of fraudsters by implementing advanced fraud detection systems that can quickly identify suspicious activity.3) Managing Cost Income Ratio & Capital Requirements: With increased pressure from regulators on capital adequacy requirements and cost-income ratios, banks must develop strategies for managing these demands while still meeting customer expectations.

Ben Kunz,14-03-2023,"If you want to thrive in the AI future, you need to become a Prompter.This ""Prompter"" concept, of humans skilled in interacting with artificial intelligence (AI) systems, comes from a SXSW speech yesterday by Kevin Kelly. Kelly, if you don't know him, is the wisest sage of technology, one of the earliest users of the Internet and co-founder of Wired magazine. He tracks trends with skepticism, keeps tech personally at arm's length, and yet has the rare ability to cut through Gartner Hype Cycle baloney to explain the real patterns of technological evolution.Yesterday on stage in Austin, Kelly asserted that today's generative AI mania is more than a fad — it's a tipping point in how humans will use tools. Unlike other tech trends that flare up like fireflies and then fade away, today's AI is more like the transition of the Internet from the code-heavy early 1980s to the invention of HMTL, when suddenly everyone and their grandmother could build web pages. ChatGPT didn't really create a new AI system — similar large language model platforms have been around for a decade. But it made the system really, really easy to use.This is no firefly-tech trend, Kelly says. In the past 2 months, 100 million people have suddenly started using AI to write essays, build business plans, make paintings -- the fastest adoption of any new technology in human history. The interface was the breakthrough, and soon every employee will use AI as commonly as Google search for answers or creations.So what does this mean for jobs? Instead of fighting the use of AI as if it were some form of plagiarism, Kelly suggests educators and businesses need to rapidly *train* people on how to interact *more* with it. The most important job of the future will be what Kelly calls ""Prompters"" — people highly skilled in how to query an AI system, with nuance and mutual exploration, to get just the right answers or outputs.AI basically revamps the old computer adage ""garbage in, garbage out"" to a new rule: ""mediocre prompt, mediocre answer."" Anyone can ask ChatGPT a simple question — ""how do I build a business using AI?"" — and it will respond with the average of all the books and webpages and Reddit links it has digested for a moderately OK answer. But if you challenge ChatGPT with nuance — ""Write a business plan for a new company that helps other companies interact with an AI system using the business rules for growth defined by Peter Thiel in his book 'Zero to One'; include a 24-month plan for sequenced investment; and identify major risks with rollout"" — you'll get output that dazzles you.To stretch these rapidly growing AI tools to their potential, we're going to have to learn how to speak with them.P.S. Here's a wonderful example below: My friendChristopher Smithhas been experimenting with virtual model shoots using AI and Photoshop. The woman below doesn't exist.

ParametricArchitecture,15-03-2023,"AI can perform many different services useful to an architect. The generative design allows for variations on a model to be composed and tested, and design alternatives to be presented for consideration. So, will artificial intelligence ever replace architects? Share your thought in the comments below!The possibility of artificial intelligence replacing creative jobs – as such, architects might be counted – remains vastly uncertain. Opinions claiming that AI can fully replace architects are similarly present as opinions claiming the exact opposite. A main variable, at the moment, remains to what extent AI will progress and develop: Currently, not all common architectural tasks can be replaced. However, fast forward, it is not impossible to imagine that AI, as this technology becomes more diverse, widespread, and advanced, can fully replace the architectural profession.When this point comes, there comes a question alongside it: Are we willing to replace it? Are we willing to replace essential human abilities such as emotional intelligence and social interactions?Tap the 🔗 link to read the full article, ""Does AI Allow Architects To Return To The Heart Of Their Profession?""https://lnkd.in/ez92q7Rb🎨 Visuals byTim Fu,Hassan Ragab,Joshua VermillionandArturo Tedeschi#parametricarchitecture#parametric#parametricdesign#computational#computation#computationaldesign#artificialintelligence#midjourney#dalle2#stablediffusion",0.9762,0.5173076923076924,1 ,191,12

Urusa Nawaz,15-03-2023,"I recently had the honor of speaking at the International Women's Day event, which was hosted by the United Nations Association in partnership with the City of Houston, Houston Community College, The Alliance, and The Links Inc. This year's theme was ""DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality.""As someone who has worked in the Retail Energy business for 22 years focused on technology and customer experience, I have seen more and more women join these fields over the years. We still have a long way to go toward gender equality. However, it’s exciting to see how the transformation in technology has and continues to open up new opportunities for women with diverse skill sets.Initially, technology was used for “Efficiency”. We built systems to run the business. Women were drawn to the field based on their aptitude for problem-solving and technical skills. This was a very male dominant industry and had a high barrier to entry and advancements.With innovation came Smart Meters, which provided more real-time insights into customer usage. Then the rise of digital channels changed the way customers interacted with us. Thus, technology shifted from being used for efficiency to building customer-focused solutions. This created a gap that was filled with women entering the field who had strong communication and empathy skills. These women were able to bridge the gap between the technical aspects of technology and the needs of customers. I lead the Digital group for Direct Energy brand at NRG and am proud to share that today my group is made up 56% women. They are the driving force behind creating customer led Digital experiences.We are now in a new era of renewable energy technology such as wind and solar power, where advancements in energy storage technology make it possible to store renewable energy and use it when needed. Artificial intelligence is being used to analyze energy usage data and provide insights. This shift has led to technology being used for solving global issues, or ""tech for good”. We are seeing women are drawn to the technology field because they see the potential for using technology to make a positive impact on the world. These women bring a unique perspective to the field and can apply their technical skills to create innovative solutions to social problems.I have a 15-year-old daughter who has been coding since the age of 9 and aspires to be a data scientist. However, her interest is not purely based on her love for technology but also driven by her passion for sustainability and making a difference in the world.We are living in exciting times where the evolution of technology has opened up and will continue to open new opportunities for women with a diverse range of skills and interests to enter the field.",0.9934,0.4974237012987013,4 ,59,0

Below are just a few take home-Emily Fiagbedzispoke to the topic, ""dare to be heard"". she made us understand that most people get nervous while speaking in public, which is very normal. But, as women and ladies, we need to find out what makes us nervous, have strategies to befriend our nerves and be confident when speaking in public. She also urged as to practice public speaking at least once a month to help improve our public speaking skills- Women and ladies present were  encouraged to support thier fellow women in tech  because we found out we were lacking in that.-During the breakout session, I joined  the group that spoke on ""Bias in AI"" byCharisma B.You will be surprised to know that, a lot of Artificial Intelligence goes into loan decisions, Job opportunities and recruiting processes; which most people are not aware of. Machine learning processes are used to shortlist candidates before the manual selection process. Selection are based on some factors which include, Ethnicity,Gender, Foreigness, spellings etc. and female candidates were more likely to experience discrimination than male candidates.  I urge you to read more about it. However, we came up with suggestions and solutions to reduce these existing bias for transparency, fairness and accountability.Let's all embrace, celebrate, and encourage women to keep rising.Dare to bold, resilient and independent, woman.A'int these pictures beautiful 🥰.

Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Advance Robotics, are talk of the town, although, few have any real sense of what they are talking about. Nevertheless, these things are for real and bound to disrupt human life as we know it. But does that mean we will all be out of work? there will be mass unemployment on a global scale? Well Absolutely Not.Let us for a moment imagine, these technologies are optimized and implemented across all fields and we are all out of work. So, now what?

No caso, como lidamos com as máquinas.💻É DIFERENTE DA INOVAÇÃO INCREMENTAL que implementa melhorias em processos ou soluções que já existem.Coincidência ou não, muitas empresas correram para oferecer soluções similares ou anunciar que em breve irão lançar soluções parentes do ChatGPT, ou seja, assistentes de escrita que funcionam a partir de comandos, também chamados de “prompts”.Seguem algumas ferramentas de IA (Inteligência Artificial) ou AI (Artificial Intelligence) que funcionam como assistentes de pesquisa e escrita:1. Canva Magic Write (Escrita Mágica) — é um gerador de texto por IA que ajuda a dar e/ou desenvolver ideias de conteúdo para posts, blogs, gerar listas, entre outros, em vários idiomas.2. Notion IA — é um aliado na escrita e composição de ideias. Não escreve apenas para blogs, mas produz resumos, lista de tarefas, pode funcionar como tradutor, editor de textos etc.Por enquanto está disponível em inglês, coreano e japonês e na versão beta (de teste) para alemão e francês.3. Bard — IA geradora de textos do Google que irá integrar as buscas, tornando as pesquisas mais precisas e mais ágeis. A principal diferença em relação ao ChatGPT é que o Bard usará informações em tempo real para dar as respostas. (Será lançado em breve)O ChatGPT foi alimentado com uma quantidade absurdamente gigante de dados coletados somente até 2021.4. LLaMA — é um modelo de IA da Meta aberto somente para profissionais que atuam em universidades e instituições de pesquisa e seu principal objetivo é ajudar essas pessoas em seus estudos sobre aplicações de inteligência artificial.Por exemplo, como a invenção de informações e vieses ou padrões de pensamento inconscientes que levam a discriminações, preconceitos, entre outros.A ferramenta foi treinada com textos de 20 idiomas mais falados no mundo e já está aceitando inscrições de pesquisadores interessados.5. Novo BING chat — a Microsoft lançou nova versão do seu buscador integrado a um modelo semelhante ao ChatGPT. A diferença é que o chat incorporado ao BING foi aprimorado para as pesquisas, conseguindo fornecer respostas contextualizadas, com citação das fontes.Traz uma experiência diferente de bate-papo. Inclusive, essa conversa diferenciada já até virou notícia bem curiosa e engraçada até (😄) no “The New York Times” (confira neste link:https://bit.ly/3FlwUWs).✍️E você já experimentou escrever usando alguma dessas Inteligências Artificiais ou outras?

Is it immune to any significant transformation?👨‍💻""Artificial intelligence can certainly facilitate various senseless processes and inspire good things. However, when discussing strategy, the most important thing is to go back to basics and learn the fundamentals, from Sun Tzu to Michael Porter and Henry Mintzberg.

Even if using AI is one of the strategies to outperform your competitors.”Sasa Spasic,Business Design Consulting🤖Facing the same question, the AI responded:""In my opinion, the future of strategic discipline will be significantly influenced by the use of artificial intelligence. AI will enable greater collection and analysis of data, leading to a better understanding of the behaviors and needs of the target audience. It will also allow greater efficiency in generating ideas and making decisions. However, it's important to note that AI cannot completely replace creative thinking and human interaction.

Eugene Gan,14-03-2023,"Tools maketh the person, or the person maketh the tools?ChatGPT and us.Let's first know the tools1. What is ChatGPT?Basically, it's built upon a language model AI called GPT-3. In simple terms, GPT-3 calculates the probability of the next word that makes sense, and strings them together to form sentences. The folks inopen.aifed GPT-3 with everything we know up to year 2021, using supervised and reinforced learning techniques. Although the core function of ChatGPT is to mimic human conversations, it's versatile enough to perform other functions from all that it learnt. It's also constantly learning from its interaction with human feedback.2. Some misconceptions.ChatGPT is omniscient.Even if we fed it all of what we know, including the library of Alexandria up to this very second, it won't know everything. Because we don't know everything. 'Nuff said.Well, at least it'll tell me what other people know, right?No. As it is fundamentally built as a language tool, it can SOMETIMES form very convincing and plausible sounding sentences regardless of how nonsensical it can be. This common problem is called Artificial Intelligence Hallucinations. It needs time to learn over time, through upvotes or downvotes plus some additional feedback from humans.Does that mean that ChatGPT will one day at least get the ""truth"" right? This is arguably the hardest thing even for us humans to do, even until today. Growing up, we subconsciously rank the quality of ""truth"" by how reliable the source of the information is. We ranked our teachers as reliable, and a stranger (for example) as unreliable. Let's break this down mathematically. If we think our teacher is 5x more reliable than a stranger, it'll take 6 strangers to make us doubt our teacher. Sounds reasonable? Amid all the different voices online, it can sometimes be challenging for us to differentiate the ""truths"" from the bent ones.3. Some current limitations.Bewear of typos.ChatGPT isn't too tolerant with typos. If you didn't even notice the typo at the beginning of this paragraph, it's because us humans are a lot more adaptable and tolerant to mistakes. We are capable of ""autocorrecting"" in real time, and with context. Computer systems are very literal. It assumes you are literal about what you're asking it. Garbage in, garbage out. Literally as simple as that.4. Use cases and potentials.Having said that, there are many uses for ChatGPT or other AI systems that I am very excited about. Ask it to find erroneous lines of software codes, it'll do well. It isn't ambiguous and relative to the person asking. From debugging software to writing essays, I think you've read enough great examples of AI's capabilities and accomplishments.I'm keeping a very keen eye on its development, and I think I might have identified a few industries and use cases for it. I'll be experimenting with my circle of friends and post our progress here.Stay tuned.#ai#chatgpt#artificialintelligence#development",0.9414,0.443576388888889,12 ,19,8

Maryna Kuzmenko,15-03-2023,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Good Experimental Practice (GEP) is the niche area with huge impact on agriculture.As the demand for sustainable agriculture grows, the importance of GEP testing facilities for crop trials increases. However, the work in GEP is hugely based on data. Hence, now most of the GEP facilities face challenges such as high costs (try to buy a SPAD for research team with limited budget), time-consuming processes (spend hours in counting flower clusters), and inaccurate data collection (visual assessment of herbicides application).Artificial intelligence (AI) can help address these challenges by streamlining GEP testing processes and improving data accuracy. AI-powered solutions can automate data collection and analysis, reducing the need for manual labor and improving efficiency.However, even more important - AI algorithms can identify patterns and insights in the data that may not be visible to the human eye. For example, AI is not tired to process terrabytes of crop imagery in comparison with human who has 8-hour working limit (however, productivity limit is even smaller).Finally, AI can be used to analyze data from previous GEP trials to identify trends and patterns that can inform future tests. This can help facilities optimize their testing protocols and improve their results over time.That's why I am so proud ofPetiole AIand our mission to democratise access to the tools for plant phenotyping and yield forecast, particularly for small and medium size growers worldwide.I captured this photo today in the morning, when finalising our report on pest presence assessment using smartphone (AI model was trained only red chilli peppers, identifies contour of fruit and assesses potential presence or absence of pest inside)#AIinfarming#AIinagriculture#PetioleAI#chilli#chillies#gep#plantscience#cropyield#ai",0.9886,0.4961607142857143,3 ,68,4

The goal is to find the assignment that minimizes the total cost of all the assignments.For example, for a food delivery app, if we have a set of orders and a set of delivery partners, and we want to assign each partner to an order such that the transportation costs are minimized, then we can use the QAP to find the best assignment.Our team atAlgoAnalyticsis exploring the potential of quantum computing algorithms for solving the QAP. Another area of research is exploring the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to solve the QAP.Overall, the QAP is a fascinating optimization problem that will continue to be an important benchmark for evaluating the performance of optimization algorithms and for developing new methods for solving complex optimization problems in the future.#research#algorithms#team#computing",0.9348,0.513432645785587,2 ,29,5

CURAZE,15-03-2023,"#CURAZEgoesSXSW💥 Wrap-up Fourth (and last) Day, Monday March 13th💡 The Most Important Takeaways: Today we had our second private speaker:Mary Gray, Senior Principal Researcher atMicrosoftResearch. The trained anthropologist is considered a leading expert on AI and ethics. She sits on numerous committees, including on theStanford University's One-Hundred-Year Study on Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of thinking about the future of artificial intelligence and making recommendations for its policy implications. The topic at breakfast was – not surprisingly –#ChatGPTand#AI. Of course, we had already heard a lot about this topic at the conference, but with Mary we were able to go deeper into the discussion. Her classification and critical consideration have sharpened our view once again. Her conclusion: With all the huge opportunities that ChatGPT offers, we must develop more awareness and understand that there is a lot at stake here (keywords: data sovereignty, privacy). Unfortunately, what was missed, was to determine the terms of use in advance. In this way, it's like throwing a new drug onto the market untested.On our last day at SXSW there were a few real highlights: Tilda Swinton (10 out of 10 points!), Garry Kasparov, andGinni Romettygave themselves and us the honor. In the evening, New Order held a concert, which we unfortunately missed.❓ The Biggest Challenges: saying goodbye – from the group, the Austin vibes, and the summer temperatures. We embraced the final moments with a few beers during a last sundowner in the Moonlight Bar.📣 Quote of the Day: There are two farewells.One by Garry Kasparov: ""I am very optimistic for the future. But men still have the monopoly on evil."" And from the fabulous Mary Gray: ""As soon as we are not biased anymore – AI will not be biased"". Love it!🖋 Additional: If you can't or don't want to wait a whole year for the next SXSW – from the 15th to the 22nd of October there will be an offshoot in Sydney. Kangaroo chronicles, so to speak.🗣 Austin Gossip: All hell breaks loose at the airport because of big departure days say the Uber drivers.

Amirhossein Tohidi,15-03-2023,"Machine learning methods are based on the idea that systems can learn from data and recognize patterns with minimal human intervention. Although machine learning methods provide accurate results for marketing decisions, the use of these methods in marketing studies is still at an early stage. Also, the ability of machine learning methods to consider heterogeneity among consumers has not been proven.Artificial neural networks are able to measure all nonlinear and complex interactions between the variables of the system, unlike discrete choice random utility models. There is no need to specify a mathematical relationship between the input and output variables. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks are known as black-box models, and the lack of interpretability is their weakness.In an article published in the British Food Journal entitled ""Organic food market segmentation based on the neobehavioristic theory of consumer behavior,"" I used four fuzzy and crisp clustering algorithms to segment the organic food market. By performing a sensitivity analysis on the output of the artificial neural network, I analyzed how the explanatory variables influence purchase intentions.We used two other machine learning methods to extract consumer behavior rules in our latest study, which is now ready for submission. From a policy perspective, the results obtained are very interesting and meaningful.Using a distributed artificial intelligence model, our next goal will be to simulate the behavior of artificial agents/consumers.#machinelearning#marketing#consumerbehavior",0.8173,0.5263157894736842,0,0,0

Rohan Korde,15-03-2023,"An asymptotic attempt at answering the biggest question going around...The#chatgpt'movement' has created two sets of opinions. One set cannot wait for it to mimic humanity. The other set is looking to find failure- hack it. Anyhow.The existential question on whether AI could, at a point on the time horizon, replace the day-to-day faculties of the human brain is not a simplistic binary call; it is instead a probability that could perhaps be informed by the#reverse#fibonaccisequenceequation.An illustration of this probability could be a collapsing triad/triangle of intelligence, intellect and wisdom on a Fibonacci spiral with consciousness as the center or origin. Let us assume that intelligence follows intellect follows wisdom follows consciousness (in that order). This is a value chain that ultimately drives consciousness.For definition,#intelligencecan be described as gathered information,#intellectcan be defined as a series of reasoning hypothesis built on top of intelligence. Wisdom on the other hand can be understood as the ability of understand human nature. Human nature can be paradoxical, counterintuitive, counterculture, contradictory or also be conventional), an intersection of the rational and emotional!Thus, while intelligence, at the bottom of the value chain is a machine at work, consciousness is the apex, the stargate to enlightenment.Will AI replace humans?I could choose the reverse fibonacci sequence principle as a safe bet to guesstimate the answer as human brain development follows the fibonacci sequence, growing at a rate dictated by the golden ratio. For AI, therefore, to close the gap between itself and the human brain, the intelligence bubble (illustration attached to this post) has to accelerate on the spiral (shown by the arc) and merge with the intellect bubble, which in turn is also accelerating towards the wisdom bubble. All 3 bubbles then have to eventually collapse into the consciousness core. At least that is how the equation is supposed to play out.At 100 trillion parameters, Chatgpt-4 matches the human brain. But that is capacity. When the chatgpt algorithm runs, 'artificial intellect' is activated, which is pretty much the output we are all getting at the moment from GPT-3 right now, making us go weak in our knees.This is where it gets really, really tough for AI. GPT-X (will call it X as X can hold multiple values) now has to patternize human nature (if at all, with its irrational paradoxes - behavioral variance) in order to come frighteningly close to the human brain. What extent of computing capacity and additional parameters will that take to do is anyone's guess. This is where we hit a bit of a dead wall.So, the short answer to the question is No. Not just yet, unless there is a quantum leap in theoretical understanding that becomes a watershed moment and also humanity's waterloo!#technology#ai#theoritical#pontificate#computing#debate#ramification#ethicalai",0.8392,0.3900396825396825,0,0,0

We’re also bringing generative AI capabilities to#GoogleCloud customers through Vertex AI, and a new Generative AI App Builder to help organizations create chat interfaces and other applications.Google Workspaceis getting some new features, too. Trusted testers will soon be able to use AI in Gmail and Google Docs to make the writing process easier -- such as typing in a topic you’d like to write about and seeing a draft generated. You can learn more in this video:https://lnkd.in/daE4wX9eThere are many teams across Google which have been working hard to reach this moment -- and this is just the first step. These are rapidly evolving technologies, and we’ll continue to iterate and improve the experiences as we get feedback from internal and external testers.

Jeden Tag taucht in der LinkedIn Timeline darüber etwas auf. Aber nicht nur im Bereich der Künstlichen Intelligenz, auch bei Virtual Reality und Augmented Reality tut sich einiges und so habe ich euch gefragt, wie schnell sich VR oder AR durchsetzen werden oder ob es für Marketingstrategien relevant werden wird. Laut den Antworten meiner letzten beiden Umfragen kam dabei folgendes zusammen:🚀 Ihr habt gesagt, dass VR oder AR für die Marketingstrategie eines Unternehmens teilweise schon von Bedeutung sind, es aber stark auf die Branche ankommt!🚀 Außerdem wart ihr der Meinung, dass Virtual Reality vielleicht in 3-5 Jahren im Büroalltag zu finden sein wird. Einige meinten jedoch auch, dass sich das nicht etablieren wird.Gerade im Zusammenhang mit dem stetigen Voranschreiten von Artificial Intelligence, die in vielen Bereichen etabliert wird, wird die Verbindung zwischen realer und virtueller Welt in den kommenden Jahren enger werden. Allerdings müssen sich die von uns entwickelten Technologien auch weiterentwickeln, damit diese Verbindung geschaffen wird und sich in vielen Bereichen durchsetzt. Was sagt ihr dazu?

The current process is imperfect. People have raised valid concerns about quality and bias in both design and impact - we share those concerns too.To improve the default behavior of our AI systems, we continue to prioritize efforts to address bias in how ChatGPT responds to prompts across a range of topics.

Rolf van Haren,15-03-2023,"REDUCTIONISM FROM LANGUAGE WITH A TOUCH OF TECHNOLOGYA description leads to a fixed mindset. Or else: If we make a description of ourselves or someone else, it leads us to find it difficult to see beyond the words that are given. This is an aspect of our brain that I call a fixed mindset. To break free from this fixed mindset and to come to new perspectives, there is a lot available on the market: Design Thinking workshops, Lego serious play and many many other fun creative sessions, which make good money but don’t solve (sorry to say it) a thing on a fundamental level.What is fundamentally not addressed is the way we use words (also in these sessions). As a linguist, I learned how limiting words are, or how they contribute to unlocking potential. Our reality is locked up in words, in descriptions, in beliefs, in fixed mindsets.Living in a world where so much is done with language as with artificial intelligence, we have to think about what we want to be amplified by technology. What reality will technology mirror to us, where will we get stuck in? Even with functions that increase or decrease valuations in an algorithm, it still makes it polarize, non-diverse and non-inclusive. It reduces us to a set of words when we are more than those words. What should we leave to technology and what should we not want to extract?Reductionism is one of the curiosities created by our eternal drive for expansion. Somewhere a contradiction, but we have subjected our own expansion of consciousness and the discovery of new language and art to the expansion of a capitalistic system that does not care about us, the people. Reductionism pushes valuable information out the process and flattens the curve of liveliness. Technology is and will play an even greater role in this it will accelerate this phenomenon.As#theupgradesociety, we try to develop in this space of technology as well. Where we aim for awareness to increase and where capitalism knows its place, hand in hand with technology for a life of well-being.Well-Being in relationship with each other and the world around us.Are you with us?",0.9903,0.555239898989899,0,0,0

Max Kozlov,15-03-2023,"AI ASSISTANTS ARE GOING VISUAL! 👀OpenAI's artificial intelligence: GPT-4 has just arrived to town. The new language model is already outsmarting all of its predecessors.The demo got me really excited! So let me share with you what it can do and how it outsmarts ChatGPT (= GPT-3.5):🖼️ 1. It understands images! GPT-4 can analyze, describe what's in a picture and make logical assumptions.-> Reads pictures and even full articles from a link.🧐 2. It's less likely to be fooled. GPT-4 is trained to stay within boundaries and not be tricked into saying ""weird"" things.-> 82% better filtering of risky content-> 40% more likely to produce factual responses📚 3. It has a longer memory. Up to 50 pages of text, in fact. So it can keep track of a conversation a whole story.-> Jump from 3,000 to 25,000 word limit.👅 4. It's multilingual. GPT-4 can answer questions accurately in 26 different languages, a significant improvement from previous models.-> Can build sandcastles from text.-> Much faster and more advanced than the last GTP-3.5.The real world implementations of this for education, customer supports, content creation and more are MASSIVE! I'm really curious where this leads. I will share my findings in future posts.GPT-4 is currently available in the ChatGPT Plus subscription for 20$/month or soon in company APIs. Currently tested with companies likeStripe,Khan Academy,DuolingoandMorgan Stanley.❓Is it worth the paid subscription? I'm considering to switch, what's your opinion?PS: GTP-3.5 helped me write this post.

deVere Group,15-03-2023,"* population crisis in Japan *Japan is facing a population crisis due to its plummeting birth rate, prompting an adviser to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to warn that the country could ""disappear"" if the trend is not reversed. The decreasing birth rate is impacting the world's third-largest economy by putting strain on the labour market, reducing the number of consumers, and increasing demand for healthcare services. The situation also puts pressure on the government's finances and hampers long-term sustainable growth.However, technology and digitisation could play a crucial role in addressing Japan's population issues. Remote work, automation, health tech, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence can be leveraged to help mitigate the impact of the ageing population on the economy and society.Global investors who are serious about building wealth should consider this crisis as an opportunity, as the Japanese government is likely to adopt innovative solutions, making it easier to implement technology-driven approaches. While Japan's population crisis remains a serious issue, it is clear that tech can help provide solutions and present once-in-a-generation opportunities for investors.Speak with an investment advisor today to learn more about how to both protect and maximise the opportunities ahead.

Richard Georges,15-03-2023,"ChatGPT-4 Is Here. Think Artificial Intelligence On Steroids.AS a subscriber to ChatGPT Plus, I am now rocking Version 4, which is far more comprehensive, intelligent and responsive that the previous version. Generative AI is becoming more ""human"" all the time. I am very excited about putting it through its paces. I also think that there are a lot of developers and companies trying to figure out how this new technology can power their software in the future. It is only a matter of time until AI is indistinguishable from the smartest human being on the planet. Of course, the systems will never be anything but human mimics that create human like conversations and information. The system will never convincingly duplicate human wit, poetic sensibility, and judgment. And, no, Virginia, Terminator robots will not walk the planet killing humans. At least, I don't think so. I could be wrong. Version 4 makes the same mistakes Version 3 made when I asked if it knew me. So, ChatGPT and other AI results will still have to be carefully edited by humans before being used. But, this thing can save hours and hours of human research and writing. Science fiction is becoming Science fact.",-0.1379,0.5388484848484847,0,0,0

Timothy D. Otten,15-03-2023,"The action and subsequent reactions to yesterday's alleged takedown of a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper by a Russian SU-27 is worth discussing. The takedown occurred over international waters and not over aNATOterritory; thus, steering clear of any Article 5 invocation (reference Article 6). Nevertheless, it does raise the question of whether or not this collision, intentional or unintentional, by a combat aircraft is to be considered an ""armed attack?"" That question matters; because if it is to be considered an ""armed attack"" and if the takedown happened in a NATO member's airspace, then this event would be much more diplomatically challenging with Article 5 potentially in play. But was it an ""armed attack?"" Does it matter that bullets or missiles were not used? Does it matter that the MQ-9 was remotely crewed (un-crewed) with no humans onboard?The latter question brings the work ofErik Lin-Greenbergof theMassachusetts Institute of Technologyand theU.S. Air Force Reserveto my mind. Through comparative wargaming, Erik highlighted how un-crewed aircraft affect conflict escalation in comparison to crewed aircraft. Yesterday's event highlights the importance of continuing this discussion. If you do not want to read the entire study, I have included the link for a quick-read summary located atWar on the Rockslocated below.Unfortunately, this event also highlights one last question. If less escalatory responses are to be expected (i.e. less risk), will militaries and governments be more willing to conduct attacks on the growing fleets of un-crewed assets?All of these questions will only become more applicable with the exponential increase in both un-crewed military operations and artificial intelligence.Link to summary:https://lnkd.in/eCgW6EfmUnited States Marine CorpsUS NavyUnited States Air ForceUS Army#diplomacy#military#law#artificialintelligence#internationalrelations#strategy#future",-0.2406,0.369927536231884,0,0,0
Manmohan S.,15-03-2023,"Thought leadership involves much more than just coming up with clever ideas;It also involves being able to put those forward-thinking ideas into practice and, as a result, drive business-wide results.Bold thought leadership has three characteristics that distinguish it from other leadership styles.1. Reframing CapabilityMachine learning and artificial intelligence are becoming more and more central to everything we do.Bold thought leadership involves proposing practical solutions and foreseeing problems that others have not even thought of.It is not a web of rhetoric and vision.Reporting and analytics can aid leaders in achieving this objective and making a graceful pivot in unforeseen circumstances.In a business environment that is constantly changing,Leaders can benefit from an external advisory board as well as customer outreach to understand how customers will behave in various situations.2. The Capacity To Motivate OthersBold thinkers need to be able to persuade others to support their cause.Businesses can accomplish this by increasing customer engagement.Sharing social issues they care about on social media and other online platforms is another way to do it.3. The Capacity To Identify Early FailureA possible recession will make bold thought leadership even more important for identifying failures, reflecting on them, and learning from them.It is crucial to assess internal procedures and decide whether a company can endure such a situation.You can spot trends early on by creating regular reports and using analytical software.As you might expect, a thought leader is a well-rounded individual who is at ease in the spotlight.Being a thought leader is not a position for everyone, so before pursuing it for one of your executives,Make sure you have found the right candidate with the qualities needed to lead your business to success.#innovationleadership#leadersofthefuture#leadership#teambuilding",0.9808,0.49227309727309726,0,2,0

Tasks such as making decisions, understanding language, recognizing speech, identifying and matching patterns and many more.AI generally makes use of a set of algorithms or instructions to imitate human intelligence.Types of AI include:1. Machine learningThis involves training computer programs to recognize patterns in data. Machine learning takes in data, and learns the data better with statistics, thereby improving its problem solving abilities.2. Deep learning: also known as deep neural learning. This is a type of machine learning that tries to imitate the human brain by inputting data through neural networks that contains a number of hidden layers. The data inputted is processed by making connections and creating patterns.3. General AI:This is a little more complex as it mirrors the human intellect by using its ability to learn and apply knowledge learned to solve problems.The invention of AI is a very huge landmark in the tech space as its uses transcend several areas of human needs.I know for a fact that we all use AI daily, I mean you just used AI some minutes ago by the way.Your fingerprint ID is an AI innovation, your face ID is also not left out.I mean we can yap about the benefits of AI all day but again every good thing has its disadvantages.

Top fighter pilots are getting defeated in (simulated) dogfights with AI pilots. In short, we have left noughts and crosses in the dust. And Russell, whose textbook, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, is an industry bible, is trying to pull the handbrake.For years he has been warning about the arrival of artificial general intelligence (AGI) — software that is far better than humans at any intellectual task. ChatGPT, which can tell jokes, pass business school exams and hold human-level conversations, is not AGI but a language model that, having ingested the written internet, is very good at guessing what word or phrase makes for a good answer to any question. Yet its emergence, and capabilities, should serve as “a wake-up call”, Russell said. “My timeline for when we might expect AGI to arrive has shortened considerably.”The problem, as he sees it, is control. He says the tools that are being rushed out — to breathless headlines and cheers from deep-pocketed investors — have been built without the developers ensuring that, as they improve, they keep human benefit as a guiding principle. “How could it be that making AI better and better makes things worse and worse — to the point of total extinction of the human race?” Russell said.",0.9698,0.5354545454545453,0,1,0

Beampad,15-03-2023,"Rental Property Investment: A Stable and Secure Form of Investment Even in Economic MeltdownIn the 2008 economic recession, the real estate market faced a massive decline, resulting in the collapse of many financial institutions. However, rental properties proved to be a stable and secure form of investment against the recession. While many homeowners struggled to keep up with their mortgage payments, rental properties continued to generate income for their owners.The real estate market has always been considered a safe investment, unlike stocks, rental properties have a tangible asset value that can be used to generate income. Additionally, rental properties offer a steady stream of income, making them an ideal investment for those looking for long-term financial stability.One of the major advantages of investing in rental properties is that they provide a hedge against inflation. As the cost of living increases, so do rental rates, allowing property owners to increase their income accordingly. Furthermore, rental properties provide a steady stream of income even during an economic downturn, making them an excellent long-term investment.Beampad, a real estate technology company, is using blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to make rental property investment even easier. With Beampad's platform, developers and property management companies can tokenize their rental properties, allowing investors to invest and earn dividends from rental income. The tokens are ERC1155 compliant and automatically become liquid, making them easy to buy, sell, or use as collateral in Beampad's lending protocol.Beampad is also using artificial intelligence to provide investors with accurate and up-to-date information about the rental market. The platform's AI algorithms analyze data from various sources to provide investors with insights into market trends, rental rates, and other key information. This information can help investors make informed decisions about which properties to invest in, reducing the risk of investing in properties that may not generate the desired returns.Beampad's innovative use of blockchain technology and AI makes it easier than ever to invest in high-income and sustainable rental properties. By leveraging these technologies, Beampad is making it possible for more people to access the benefits of rental property investment, helping to secure their financial futures.#blockchain#technology#investment#ai#sustainable#bitcoin#property#beampad#beamtoken",0.9893,0.552956989247312,1 ,2,0

Atte Roine,15-03-2023,"My mandatory take on OpenAI - I asked it what is dynamic pricing. Sounds  legit.----Dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy where the price of a product or service is adjusted in real-time based on various factors such as demand, supply, seasonality, competition, and customer behavior. Dynamic pricing is often used in industries such as travel, hospitality, e-commerce, and ride-sharing.The main objective of dynamic pricing is to maximize revenue and profit by charging different prices to different customers based on their willingness to pay. For example, airlines use dynamic pricing to adjust ticket prices based on the time of booking, the number of available seats, and the demand for the flight.Dynamic pricing can be implemented using various algorithms and techniques such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics. These techniques enable businesses to analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior and adjust prices accordingly.While dynamic pricing can be beneficial for businesses by increasing revenue and profitability, it can also be controversial among customers who may feel that they are being unfairly charged different prices. As such, businesses need to be transparent and communicate their pricing strategy clearly to their customers.",0.9698,0.49090909090909085,0,0,0

Adetimilehin Obanla,15-03-2023,"5 ways in picking profitable stocksJust like how Benjamin Graham cited in his evergreen book, 'The Intelligent investor' knowing the value of a stock and the fair price to pay for a stock is way superior to speculation.Being objective in your approach to investing will place you within the space of profitable investors rather than being subjective to market behavior characterized by the fear/greed index.Here are 5 ways to pick profitable stocks1. Choose profitable or promising industries, then invest in the firms/companies that are part of those industries.Knowing what industries that are viable in the future gives you an edge in picking the right stocks. For example; the Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality industries have started to gain widespread acceptance. Pitching your tent in this space will increase your chance of becoming profitable in the long run.2. Quantitative AnalysisThe financials of a firm/company is a huge indication to know if you should buy into their business or not. Knowing the Balance sheet, Income statement and statement of cash flow in a company can well inform you in buying into the company.  3.3. Always invest in indexes (Diversify your portfolio)We all know it is not wise to put all your eggs in one basket. Profitable hedge fund manager Ray Dalio is said to have a strategy of investing in 15 indexes that have a negative correlation, diversifying his portfolio. If you lose money in one company, your other profits in another company can help you cover up for the money lost.4. Qualitative AnalysisBrand recognition is a huge plus in making a decision to buy a stock. Brands like Apple, and Coca-Cola make it easy for investors to buy their stock because of acceptance and what they represent.5. LeadershipThe leadership of the business has a profound impact on the business and its future relevance. It is important to have a good view of who is leading the brand to inform your purchasing decisions.My name is Adetimilehin and I am a Financial Market Analyst.

In February 2023, Google also launched#Bard, its rival to Chat GPT, which spurred many reactions online.And, these are only two of the many, many companies experimenting with interactive and generative AI tools.While these developments are exciting, they pose certain policy and regulatory challenges.

Furthermore, depending on how AI models are trained and deployed,#dataprotection,#intellectualproperty,#antitrustand intermediary liability concerns may exist.While many of these problems are not new, and are inherent to the existence of the internet itself, there is a need for governments to understand the key issues pertaining to AI and develop robust laws and regulations.

If your answer would be that it helps your cells to attach and to divide, ask yourself whether attachment and proliferation are indeed compatible with the cellular phenotype you want to study. Are you not altering the physiology of your cells to ever proliferating tumor look-a-likes? Is feeding your cells concentrate not turning them into little body builders? Is FCS indeed a valid ‘golden standard’, or is there room to better mimic human physiology?There are good scientific arguments to change cell culture habits and we will outline 7 of them in weekly posts.

Zarak Khan,15-03-2023,"The Rise of Artificial Intelligence in BusinessArtificial Intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic in the tech industry for several years now, but we are now seeing its widespread adoption in business applications. With advancements in machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision, AI is transforming the way we work and making businesses more efficient, effective, and profitable.One of the most significant benefits of AI in business is the ability to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more complex and creative work. This can save companies time and money while also improving the quality and accuracy of their output. AI-powered chatbots are also being used to improve customer service, providing instant responses to queries and reducing response times.Another area where AI is making a significant impact is in data analysis. By processing vast amounts of data, AI algorithms can identify patterns and trends that humans may miss, providing insights that can inform decision-making and improve business strategies. AI-powered analytics tools can also help businesses personalize their marketing efforts, identifying and targeting specific customer segments based on their preferences and behavior.AI is also transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. In healthcare, AI-powered diagnostics tools can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses, while in finance, AI-powered fraud detection systems can identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. In manufacturing, AI-powered predictive maintenance tools can help prevent equipment breakdowns, minimizing downtime and reducing costs.However, as with any new technology, there are also challenges associated with the adoption of AI in business. One of the most significant concerns is the potential impact on jobs, with some predicting that AI could replace many human workers. To address this, businesses need to consider the ethical implications of AI and develop strategies for reskilling and upskilling their employees.In summary, AI is transforming the way we work and opening up new opportunities for businesses across industries. While there are challenges associated with its adoption, the benefits of AI in business are clear, and it is only set to become more prevalent in the years to come.#technology#ai#artificialintelligence#work#machinelearning",0.9971,0.5914141414141414,0,1,0

Alessandro Mantelero,15-03-2023,"Some critical notes on a critical issue of the AI Act: Impact on fundamental rightsIn the final stage of the AI Act discussion, there is a positive focus on fundamental rights impact assessment (FRIA). However, the core issues relating to the model for carrying out this assessment have not yet been elaborated in such a way as to provide meaningful input to companies and other entities that will have to comply with the AI Act.Several limitations affect the proposed models:- Use of lengthy questionnaires following an awareness-raising than an impact assessment model- Misunderstandings about the key parameters to be considered for impact assessment- An aggregate impact on fundamental rights regardless of their specific nature- Little focus on how to quantify the risk, which is at the core of AI Act conformity assessment.Based on the experience of the DPIA/PIA, there is a need for more streamlined proposals that provide a methodology rather than a fixed scheme that cannot cover the full variety of#aiapplications.As in human rights impact assessment, self-assessment is possible but must be based on independent expert evaluation, which is the only way to contextualise how specific AI applications may affect#fundamentalrights. Expert-based evaluation, combined with appropriate stakeholder and rightsholder participation tools, can easily rely on a lean assessment model, which also improves the transparency of the assessment.Adopting such an approach is possible, not by using a 300-pages impact assessment model, but by outlining the key elements to be considered and framing a methodology to combine and assess the different AI risk components relating to fundamental rights (https://lnkd.in/d6wgRxWg, §5, open access).This is not to promote a personal point of view, already tested in various international contexts, but just to point out that the current debate is likely to complicate the way AI Act will be implemented. Unrealistic standards for HRIA/FRIA, rather than a general methodology, and lengthy and cumbersome assessment models (including misunderstandings in risk assessment) are not in line with the previous experience in DPIA/HRIA and are likely to turn FRIA into a mere ticking-box and bureaucratic exercise.Although a bureaucratic exercise may be of interest to a part of the standardisation and consultancy business, past experience teaches us that compliance only on paper does not help to tackle risks effectively.It would therefore be important for the EU bodies (includingEuropean Union Agency for Fundamental RightsandCEN and CENELEC), to start a serious and inclusive discussion on FRIA, avoiding inner circles and including real domain experts and critical voices.",-0.7195,0.565785764622974,15 ,74,5 
Sebastian Comsa,15-03-2023,"I rarely share these kinds of stories; however, this one stuck with me, and it has been quite a personal one. I was flying on a business trip the other day to Bucharest - Frankfurt - Luxembourg (Monday) and back to Bucharest via Munich from Luxembourg (Tuesday). So I had the pleasure of experiencing how an AI solution with no human supervision can impact your travel schedule when flights are delayed, missed connection and arrival of 6hours+ at the destination.So why has this stuck with me? I have been talking a lot about ethics and explainability in AI. Not just industries like financial services should be under scrutiny when it comes to the usage of AI in decision processes. Such as credit scoring and load applications that are processed without human intervention, and financial institutions need to prove and explain to the regulator why the AI solution took that decision.So what happened to me? My first leg of the flight was delayed, which in turn made me lose my connecting flight; now, as you'd imagine in a usual scenario, you'd think you will be rebooked on the next flight. And I was rebooked to the next flight back from where I started my journey, not to my actual destination. So clearly, this airline company's new AI solution has made a wildly inaccurate decision that impacted me. It cancelled all other flights and booked me on the returning flight from Frankfurt to Bucharest. So the AI decided that I don't necessarily need to be in Luxembourg because I need to return to Bucharest right after arriving in Frankfurt.Oh, hi,Lufthansa; let's talk about ethics, explainability and accountability when using AI solutions that impact your passengers in a way that there is no human supervision. I'm a big fan of yours, but your goals of saving on personal and investing in a solution that needs to be adequately trained are giving you more trouble than saving money.I want to give big kudos to the ladies in the Lufthansa Senator Lounge Hall B (FRA Airport) for doing their best in reinstating my flights and booking me on the last flight to Luxembourg so I can get there and attend an important client meeting! This proves that AI solutions can't replace the ethics and empathy of human touch in these processes, so kudos for their actions in trying to make it right! Is there any explainability included in the decisioning of the AI process?Lufthansa, I recommend getting up to speed with the latest directives at theEuropean Parliament- legislation in progress (https://lnkd.in/eiu_sRHb) for Artificial Intelligence liability directives; this will cover accountability. 😎Nevertheless, kudos again to your excellentLufthansaground staff who got me to the end where I needed to go, even though it was 6h+ later; now let's talk privately about my customer rights ( on missed connection and delayed arrival at destination).#ai#travel#explainableai#ethicalai#dataanalytics",0.9872,0.31625370243791295,1 ,8,0

However, 2022 saw widespread exposure of the technology world to these tools. OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot are powerful tools that provide programmers with intelligent code recommendations and completion for improved development efficiency.🔹 The Codex model series is a descendant of OpenAI’s GPT-3 series, which has been trained on natural language as well as billions of lines of code. Codex is all about translation. Thanks to OpenAI Codex, computers are more able to understand our intentions. It allows us to use natural languages and interpret these inputs into lines of code.🔹 When understanding the way how OpenAI Codex operates, developers can find their workload to be much lessened. What they must do is to divide the large problem into smaller ones and describe the APIs, libraries, and functions so that Codex understands exactly what they want. The Codex system will handle the rest, making suggestions and generating lines of code according to the input.🔹 GitHub Copilot (using OpenAI Codex) is a cloud-based artificial intelligence software powered by GitHub and OpenAI that supports programmers by autocompleting code. It is now available for usage by developers in Neovim, JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code. According to GitHub's research, GitHub Copilot generates more than 40% of code for developers who use it on average, increasing coding speed by 55%.✨ 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐆𝐢𝐭𝐇𝐮𝐛 𝐂𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐥𝐨𝐭⚡️ It makes recommendations for code based on the project’s context and style convention and even suggests providing the complete algorithms, accelerating the speed of coding⚡️ It is relatively easy to use⚡️ GitHub Copilot has helped 88% of devs feel substantially more productive.For that reason, OpenAI Codex and GitHub Copilot deem inevitably valuable tools for developers. At the same time, while it is impossible to reject the mind-blowing functions and assistance of these two tools in programming, keep in mind that they cannot entirely replace programmers because they need our input and critical editing for producing viable code in reality.---Ohio Digital - More than a partnerAddress:- 6 Kingsborough Way, Zetland, NSW 2017, Australia- 11F, MITEC Building, Duong Dinh Nghe Street, Yen Hoa, Cau Giay, Hanoi, VietnamEmail:info@ohio-digital.comTel: (+84) 24 3795 5813#Technology#News#OpenAI#Github",0.9633,0.5133415435139574,0,0,0

Alexander Smazhuk,15-03-2023,"Artificial intelligence, ChatGPT... Could it be a revolution in marketing?It's not a new Google algorithm or a social media add and not even a usual chatbot. Be sure with ChatGPT and the same technologies we are already at the start of a new digital era.According to OpenAI ChatGPT uses ""reinforced learning with human feedback"" (RLHF) — which is what makes it sound so real. And that's why it could replace some marketing specialists.What tasks could the business solve with ChatGPT?Customer supportOne of the biggest advantages of ChatGPT is its ability to provide personalized customer experiences. By using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, ChatGPT can understand the nuances of human language and respond to customer queries in real time. This means that businesses can use ChatGPT to provide personalized responses to customers based on their specific needs, preferences, and interests. For example, if a customer is looking for a specific product or service, ChatGPT can provide relevant recommendations based on their search history and purchase behavior.Analytics and researchesAnother way ChatGPT can change the future of marketing is by providing businesses with valuable insights into customer behavior. By analyzing customer interactions with ChatGPT, businesses can gain insights into customer preferences, needs, and pain points. This information can be used to improve product development, customer service, and marketing strategies. For example, if customers are frequently asking for a specific feature or product, businesses can use this information to develop new products or improve existing ones.LidgenerationChatGPT can also help businesses to automate lead generation. It could be used to qualify leads and schedule appointments with potential customers. So it could free up sales teams to focus on closing deals.Content creationWith the help of ChatGPT, you could create a general content plan, ideas for content lines, and single everyday posts.By automating only these tasks, businesses can save time and resources, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their business.Wright down in comments what other marketing tasks and functions can ChatGPT perform for the business.P.S. On the other side, AI still could not change the human mind in the processes of strategy creation. So if you need to form the vision for your business, define global and short-term goals, create a comprehensive promotion strategy, or determine the methods of its implementation, then write your questions to me in personal messages!#marketing#business#sales#digital#ai#artificialintelligence#machinelearning#google#content#customerservice#analytics#algorithms#marketingconsultant#businesscoach",0.9916,0.38006960359901537,0,0,0

Dr. Dimitrios Geromichalos,15-03-2023,"""Talking About Large Language Models""Dank der rasanten Fortschritte im Bereich der künstlichen Intelligenz sind wir in eine Ära eingetreten, in der sich Technologie und Philosophie auf interessante Weise überschneiden. Im Zentrum dieser Überschneidung stehen große Sprachmodelle (Large Language Models, LLMs). Je besser LLMs die menschliche Sprache nachahmen, desto anfälliger werden wir für Anthropomorphismus, d. h. dafür, die Systeme, in die sie eingebettet sind, als menschenähnlicher zu betrachten, als sie tatsächlich sind. Dieser Trend wird durch die natürliche Tendenz verstärkt, philosophisch aufgeladene Begriffe wie ""weiß"", ""glaubt"" und ""denkt"" zu verwenden, wenn diese Systeme beschrieben werden. Um diese Tendenz abzuschwächen, plädiert dieses Papier dafür, immer wieder einen Schritt zurückzutreten, um uns daran zu erinnern, wie LLMs und die Systeme, zu denen sie gehören, tatsächlich funktionieren. Die Hoffnung ist, dass eine größere wissenschaftliche Präzision zu mehr philosophischer Nuancierung im Diskurs über künstliche Intelligenz führen wird, sowohl innerhalb des Fachgebiets als auch im öffentlichen Bereich.https://lnkd.in/e67sR5rm#LLM#LLMs#MLLM#AI#KI#artificialintelligence#Künstlicheintelligenz#gpt4#chatgpt",-0.9761,0.42857142857142855,0,4,1

IT support is one area where AI can be of great assistance. The primary objectives of IT support are to identify and resolve technical issues efficiently. AI can help reduce the number of issues that need human intervention by automating simple tasks such as password reset and providing recommendations for known solutions. Additionally, AI can also be used to generate reports on trends and usage patterns which can help identify potential areas of improvement.While the use of AI in IT support is still in its infancy, it is evident that there is great potential for it to automate routine tasks and improve efficiency.

These include organized crime, climate change and geopolitical threats. They must also deal with restricted budgets. To meet these challenges, critical organizations need new and more efficient ways of working. Overall, they must be able to do more with less. But how can they do this?Critical communications users are increasingly using mobile broadband to meet these challenges.Several public safety organizations are already using Agnet or are bringing it into use, such as in RRF (Réseau Radio du Futur – France’s pioneering case for security and emergency rescue forces) and Virve 2 (Finland’s new generation public safety network) projects. These projects will provide 4G/LTE broadband services, which will work seamlessly with existing narrowband services during the migration period.4G/LTE already offers a good way to extend their current applications to broadband networks, as well as to adopt new broadband apps. 5G will further enable new and significantly better ways for public safety and other professional organizations to manage incidents and emergencies. It can even help find new ways to prevent them.5G – a wealth of new opportunitiesCities are becoming ever more connected, integrated and digitalized. 5G technology plays a key role in this. It is designed to be a unified, more capable platform.5G supports new services such as Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML), and versatile data and analytics services. This helps mobile communications expand into new areas – including safe city solutions.5G is also substantially faster than 4G and with more capacity, thus creating never-before-seen opportunities for critical communications users.Rich and abundant data can help make critical operations more efficient and deliver better situational awareness.

Bhavya Mishra - Content Writer,15-03-2023,"Are content writers about to have a robotic co-writer?Googlejust brought AI to Docs and Gmail!As a content writer, have you ever wished for an extra set of hands (or fingers) to help you get through your workload? Well, it seems like Google might have heard your plea, and they're answering it with the latest update to their Docs and Gmail platforms. That's right, artificial intelligence (AI) is coming to these two popular tools, and it's set to revolutionize the way content writers work.With the new AI capabilities, Google Docs will be able to analyze your writing and suggest changes in real-time. This means that you'll no longer need to spend hours sifting through your work for errors or trying to come up with better word choices. Instead, you can focus on the more creative aspects of writing, knowing that your AI co-writer has got your back.But that's not all. The integration of AI in Gmail means that you'll be able to compose emails faster than ever before.The platform will be able to suggest complete sentences and even entire paragraphs based on the content of your email.So, if you're struggling to find the right words to express your thoughts, Google's AI will be there to help you out.Of course, some content writers might be skeptical about the impact of AI on their profession. After all, writing is a highly creative and personal endeavor, and some might worry that an AI co-writer could detract from their unique voice.But, in reality, AI is simply a tool that can help you achieve your writing goals more efficiently. With the time and energy saved by the AI, you'll have more space to focus on the aspects of writing that require a human touch.So, what does this all mean for content writers? Well, it means that the future of writing is here, and it's looking brighter than ever.With the integration of AI into Docs and Gmail, content writers can now produce high-quality content more efficiently than ever before.So, let's embrace this new technology and see where it takes us.

Harpreet Gill,15-03-2023,"Exciting new developments are taking place in the Tech/IT industry across Europe, and it's an exciting time to be a part of this dynamic sector. From new technologies and innovative start-ups to major investments in research and development, Europe is quickly becoming a global hub for Tech/IT innovation.One area where we're seeing rapid progress is in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In countries like Germany, France, and the UK, AI is being used to transform industries ranging from healthcare to finance. Startups like Paris-based Snips are working on cutting-edge natural language processing technology, while German firms like Celonis and Flixbus are leveraging AI to improve their business processes.Another exciting development is the growth of fintech start-ups across Europe. Companies like Revolut, N26, and Transferwise are challenging traditional banking models and making it easier than ever for consumers to manage their finances. Meanwhile, established banks are investing in digital transformation initiatives to remain competitive in an increasingly crowded market.Beyond these specific areas, Europe is also home to many innovative startups and established tech giants like Spotify, Adyen, and Zalando. These companies are constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the tech world, and they're attracting top talent from around the globe.Of course, Europe faces its share of challenges, including regulatory hurdles and a shortage of skilled workers.But with initiatives like the European Commission's Digital Single Market and the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, the region is working to overcome these obstacles and continue its ascent as a global tech powerhouse.Overall, there's never been a more exciting time to be a part of the Tech/IT industry in Europe.

DHRUV PODDAR,15-03-2023,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and HOW THE FUTURE FOR ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE LOOKS LIKE?If you are unaware, recently, on January 5th, Amazon confirmed that it laid off 18,000 of its employees. Alphabet, Google’s parent company laid off 12,000 people. Meta laid off 11,000 and Twitter laid off 4,000. Even Microsoft and Salesforce declared 10,000 and 8,000 people redundant.Amongst a variety of reasons, reasons like over hiring, uncertain global macroeconomic conditions and strong tailwinds from the covid-19 pandemic came up. But it cannot be so simple, right?All the big tech giants, declaring redundancy and firing people, all at the same time. It cannot be so simple, in black and white, right?Well, the answer is simple, it is just the start of Artificial Intelligence taking over the world, and companies like Alphabet, Amazon and Meta have had the advantage of exercising the immense potential and power of the same, but at the same time creating a catastrophe.It might make us wonder, even scared, when we look at how the future might shape, in our fields of Primary Interests, that is Accounting and Finance, where tasks are quite repetitive in nature, especially if we look at Accounting, specifically.One thing is for sure, that roles of finance and accounts professionals will be fast changing. Will they run out of jobs? Well, we don’t know about that. But, if there is something that you do, that a machine can also do, then a machine will always be preferred. One, because machines are more accurate, and two, most importantly, machine costs are quite inexpensive as compared to skilled human labor costs. So you will run out of your job if you are not bringing anything new to the table.That being said, here is the analogy we like to use. Do you remember back in the day, when the computer was first used to maintain books and for bookkeeping? Despite all the narratives that were going around at that moment, we eventually did shift to a complete system of maintaining books on accounting soft wares and not on paper based, manual accounting system. Well, did that mean that the computer barred the need for accounting, or did that mean that the computer took away jobs? The way I see it, neither. It just created a more advanced and sophisticated system for accurate, confirmatory and predictive bookkeeping, accounting, auditing, and assurance, for the greater good, of course.

New market entrants are harnessing novel technologies such as real-time data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence which are paving the way for a new era of how money is handled and investments are made. On the other hand, it is expected that environmental risks and their associated losses will increase in the future as a result of climate change. In this context, environmental and other ESG risks have become increasingly relevant for financial institutions who will need to enhance data collection to improve risk management and better quantify potential losses and develop analytical tools for quantifying the impact of environmental risks.The Earth Observation data and services for the Insurance and Finance market segments will see an annual growth rate of 20% in the next decade, resulting in almost €1 bn total revenues. During this webinar,Justyna RedelkiewiczandBernardo Brumfrom theEUSPA - EU Agency for the Space Programme, will present how Earth Observation space technologies address these challenges and how they can be best leveraged to support the decision-making process of banks and financial institutions.Organized by the AI Roundtable at FIRM that is co-led bySebastian Fritz-Morgenthaland me.

Prepares children for a successful future🍇According to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report, artificial intelligence (AI) will create nearly 58 million jobs over the next few years. Thus, it is a wise decision to encourage your children to learn about AI (Artificial Intelligence) and machine learning from an early age. This gives them a competitive advantage and increases their chances of landing lucrative jobs.🍒2. Make kids problem solvers and logical thinkers🤹‍♂️The monotonous, undirected learning bores the children and causes them to lose interest. However, the inclusion of AI in the learning process makes the process more engaging and exciting. 🖲AI based STEM toys like Troot typically present them with a problem that is based on real-life scenarios. In this manner, the children apply their problem-solving and logical thinking abilities to solve the problem at hand and become the creators of the solution.🧌3. It fosters a child's interest in hands-on learning🪷The AI-based courses emphasize hands-on learning rather than just learning the theory. As a result, it will make these courses more interactive for children. They will gain practical knowledge of AI by working on real-world projects. 🕹Each project addresses a specific societal issue, and the children will learn how to use AI applications to contribute for the betterment of society.☎...#ailearning#artificialintelligence#machinelearning#edtech#innovation",0.9853,0.44642857142857145,0,0,0

De vooruitzichten voor 2023 laten maar weer eens zien dat de sector toekomstbestendig is gezien de groeivooruitzichten. IT blijft nog altijd in trek, onder andere door de trend binnen andere sectoren om door te gaan met digitaliseren. Het arbeidstekort blijft een grote uitdaging en de grootste groeibelemmering. De opkomst van volwassen Artificial Intelligence toepassingen gaat dat voorlopig niet oplossen, maar betere inzet van talent kan wel bijdragen aan de oplossing.

CURAZE,15-03-2023,"#CURAZEgoesSXSW💥 Wrap-up Fourth (and last) Day, Monday March 13th💡 The Most Important Takeaways: Today we had our second private speaker:Mary Gray, Senior Principal Researcher atMicrosoftResearch. The trained anthropologist is considered a leading expert on AI and ethics. She sits on numerous committees, including on theStanford University's One-Hundred-Year Study on Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of thinking about the future of artificial intelligence and making recommendations for its policy implications. The topic at breakfast was – not surprisingly –#ChatGPTand#AI. Of course, we had already heard a lot about this topic at the conference, but with Mary we were able to go deeper into the discussion. Her classification and critical consideration have sharpened our view once again. Her conclusion: With all the huge opportunities that ChatGPT offers, we must develop more awareness and understand that there is a lot at stake here (keywords: data sovereignty, privacy). Unfortunately, what was missed, was to determine the terms of use in advance. In this way, it's like throwing a new drug onto the market untested.On our last day at SXSW there were a few real highlights: Tilda Swinton (10 out of 10 points!), Garry Kasparov, andGinni Romettygave themselves and us the honor. In the evening, New Order held a concert, which we unfortunately missed.❓ The Biggest Challenges: saying goodbye – from the group, the Austin vibes, and the summer temperatures. We embraced the final moments with a few beers during a last sundowner in the Moonlight Bar.📣 Quote of the Day: There are two farewells.One by Garry Kasparov: ""I am very optimistic for the future. But men still have the monopoly on evil."" And from the fabulous Mary Gray: ""As soon as we are not biased anymore – AI will not be biased"". Love it!🖋 Additional: If you can't or don't want to wait a whole year for the next SXSW – from the 15th to the 22nd of October there will be an offshoot in Sydney. Kangaroo chronicles, so to speak.🗣 Austin Gossip: All hell breaks loose at the airport because of big departure days say the Uber drivers.

Amirhossein Tohidi,15-03-2023,"Machine learning methods are based on the idea that systems can learn from data and recognize patterns with minimal human intervention. Although machine learning methods provide accurate results for marketing decisions, the use of these methods in marketing studies is still at an early stage. Also, the ability of machine learning methods to consider heterogeneity among consumers has not been proven.Artificial neural networks are able to measure all nonlinear and complex interactions between the variables of the system, unlike discrete choice random utility models. There is no need to specify a mathematical relationship between the input and output variables. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks are known as black-box models, and the lack of interpretability is their weakness.In an article published in the British Food Journal entitled ""Organic food market segmentation based on the neobehavioristic theory of consumer behavior,"" I used four fuzzy and crisp clustering algorithms to segment the organic food market. By performing a sensitivity analysis on the output of the artificial neural network, I analyzed how the explanatory variables influence purchase intentions.We used two other machine learning methods to extract consumer behavior rules in our latest study, which is now ready for submission. From a policy perspective, the results obtained are very interesting and meaningful.Using a distributed artificial intelligence model, our next goal will be to simulate the behavior of artificial agents/consumers.#machinelearning#marketing#consumerbehavior",0.8173,0.5263157894736842,0,0,0

Yannis Angelis,15-03-2023,"💚 Shifting away from thinking of#wellbeingin#educationas a goal, towards practicing it in#relationship💚🌎 In a continuously changing educational environment, the many technological advancements and unprecedented social phenomena (pandemic, war, cost of living, AI awe) are continuously challenging our individual and collective mental, physical, emotional, and social resilience.I am delighted to offer this free-of-charge interactive#workshop, where you are invited to experiment with ideas about the way we think and perceive the nuance of well-being in such an environment. We will challenge dominant ideas about well-being by exploring and hatching questions like:👉 How could we free ourselves from seeing well-being as a health-informed goal, where the focus falls mainly on individual responsibility for its achievement? What could be an alternative process in an educational field?👉 How could we collectively explore well-being as something that exists, evolves, and can be practiced in a transcontextual and interdependent environment?👉 How could educational#systemsand actors influence Artificial Intelligence advancements (e.g.#chatGPT) and not just only the other way around?👉 How could narrative work become the incubator for learning#communitiesto practice well-being in mutuality and relationship?Bring your burning questions with you and join me on Thursday the 30th of March in this online workshop, organized byT-hap, from 15:00-16:00 CET, in ZOOM.

Akshay Bhore,15-03-2023,"With the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020, businesses worldwide rapidly transitioned to remote work. Video conferencing thus became an indispensable tool for personal and professional communication.As remote work continues to be the new normal, virtual meetings have become essential for staying connected with colleagues, clients, and partners. As a result, virtual meeting software providers are constantly exploring new ways to enhance their platforms.The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is one such way.Accordingly, the following are some of the virtual meeting software providers using AI in their software:𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐨𝐟𝐭 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐬: In February 2023,Microsoftannounced the  launch of Teams Premium, which features large language models powered byOpenAI’s GPT-3.5, along with other innovations targeted to make meetings more intelligent, personalized, and secure.𝐒𝐤𝐲𝐩𝐞: In February 2023, Microsoft planned to bring the AI-based Bing chatbot to mobile andSkype.𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐞𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟: In November 2022,TrueConfreleased AI-Powered video meeting solutions with auto framing, virtual backgrounds, and smart noise suppression.Zoom: This widely-used software has introduced advanced Al background noise detection to automatically reduce environmental noises, such as fans, dogs barking, and vacuum cleaners, to improve the meeting experience.Google𝐌𝐞𝐞𝐭: The platform uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to eliminate noise in the background for video calls/conferences.By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into their software, virtual meeting software providers will be able to offer a more seamless and productive virtual meeting experience for their users.For more such insights, you can check out the Global Virtual Meeting Software Market report here:https://lnkd.in/dQ4GG99g#artificialintelligence#technology#communication#remotework#virtualmeetingsWhich virtual meeting software have you found most effective for your remote work needs?

Rohan Korde,15-03-2023,"An asymptotic attempt at answering the biggest question going around...The#chatgpt'movement' has created two sets of opinions. One set cannot wait for it to mimic humanity. The other set is looking to find failure- hack it. Anyhow.The existential question on whether AI could, at a point on the time horizon, replace the day-to-day faculties of the human brain is not a simplistic binary call; it is instead a probability that could perhaps be informed by the#reverse#fibonaccisequenceequation.An illustration of this probability could be a collapsing triad/triangle of intelligence, intellect and wisdom on a Fibonacci spiral with consciousness as the center or origin. Let us assume that intelligence follows intellect follows wisdom follows consciousness (in that order). This is a value chain that ultimately drives consciousness.For definition,#intelligencecan be described as gathered information,#intellectcan be defined as a series of reasoning hypothesis built on top of intelligence. Wisdom on the other hand can be understood as the ability of understand human nature. Human nature can be paradoxical, counterintuitive, counterculture, contradictory or also be conventional), an intersection of the rational and emotional!Thus, while intelligence, at the bottom of the value chain is a machine at work, consciousness is the apex, the stargate to enlightenment.Will AI replace humans?I could choose the reverse fibonacci sequence principle as a safe bet to guesstimate the answer as human brain development follows the fibonacci sequence, growing at a rate dictated by the golden ratio. For AI, therefore, to close the gap between itself and the human brain, the intelligence bubble (illustration attached to this post) has to accelerate on the spiral (shown by the arc) and merge with the intellect bubble, which in turn is also accelerating towards the wisdom bubble. All 3 bubbles then have to eventually collapse into the consciousness core. At least that is how the equation is supposed to play out.At 100 trillion parameters, Chatgpt-4 matches the human brain. But that is capacity. When the chatgpt algorithm runs, 'artificial intellect' is activated, which is pretty much the output we are all getting at the moment from GPT-3 right now, making us go weak in our knees.This is where it gets really, really tough for AI. GPT-X (will call it X as X can hold multiple values) now has to patternize human nature (if at all, with its irrational paradoxes - behavioral variance) in order to come frighteningly close to the human brain. What extent of computing capacity and additional parameters will that take to do is anyone's guess. This is where we hit a bit of a dead wall.So, the short answer to the question is No. Not just yet, unless there is a quantum leap in theoretical understanding that becomes a watershed moment and also humanity's waterloo!#technology#ai#theoritical#pontificate#computing#debate#ramification#ethicalai",0.8392,0.3900396825396825,0,0,0

Laut den Antworten meiner letzten beiden Umfragen kam dabei folgendes zusammen:🚀 Ihr habt gesagt, dass VR oder AR für die Marketingstrategie eines Unternehmens teilweise schon von Bedeutung sind, es aber stark auf die Branche ankommt!🚀 Außerdem wart ihr der Meinung, dass Virtual Reality vielleicht in 3-5 Jahren im Büroalltag zu finden sein wird. Einige meinten jedoch auch, dass sich das nicht etablieren wird.Gerade im Zusammenhang mit dem stetigen Voranschreiten von Artificial Intelligence, die in vielen Bereichen etabliert wird, wird die Verbindung zwischen realer und virtueller Welt in den kommenden Jahren enger werden.

The current process is imperfect. People have raised valid concerns about quality and bias in both design and impact - we share those concerns too.To improve the default behavior of our AI systems, we continue to prioritize efforts to address bias in how ChatGPT responds to prompts across a range of topics. As part of this work, we’re exploring opportunities for the broader public to have a say in how these systems are designed.

Rolf van Haren,15-03-2023,"REDUCTIONISM FROM LANGUAGE WITH A TOUCH OF TECHNOLOGYA description leads to a fixed mindset. Or else: If we make a description of ourselves or someone else, it leads us to find it difficult to see beyond the words that are given. This is an aspect of our brain that I call a fixed mindset. To break free from this fixed mindset and to come to new perspectives, there is a lot available on the market: Design Thinking workshops, Lego serious play and many many other fun creative sessions, which make good money but don’t solve (sorry to say it) a thing on a fundamental level.What is fundamentally not addressed is the way we use words (also in these sessions). As a linguist, I learned how limiting words are, or how they contribute to unlocking potential. Our reality is locked up in words, in descriptions, in beliefs, in fixed mindsets.Living in a world where so much is done with language as with artificial intelligence, we have to think about what we want to be amplified by technology. What reality will technology mirror to us, where will we get stuck in? Even with functions that increase or decrease valuations in an algorithm, it still makes it polarize, non-diverse and non-inclusive. It reduces us to a set of words when we are more than those words. What should we leave to technology and what should we not want to extract?Reductionism is one of the curiosities created by our eternal drive for expansion. Somewhere a contradiction, but we have subjected our own expansion of consciousness and the discovery of new language and art to the expansion of a capitalistic system that does not care about us, the people. Reductionism pushes valuable information out the process and flattens the curve of liveliness. Technology is and will play an even greater role in this it will accelerate this phenomenon.As#theupgradesociety, we try to develop in this space of technology as well. Where we aim for awareness to increase and where capitalism knows its place, hand in hand with technology for a life of well-being.Well-Being in relationship with each other and the world around us.Are you with us?",0.9903,0.555239898989899,0,1,0

The new language model is already outsmarting all of its predecessors.The demo got me really excited! So let me share with you what it can do and how it outsmarts ChatGPT (= GPT-3.5):🖼️ 1. It understands images! GPT-4 can analyze, describe what's in a picture and make logical assumptions.-> Reads pictures and even full articles from a link.🧐 2. It's less likely to be fooled. GPT-4 is trained to stay within boundaries and not be tricked into saying ""weird"" things.-> 82% better filtering of risky content-> 40% more likely to produce factual responses📚 3. It has a longer memory. Up to 50 pages of text, in fact. So it can keep track of a conversation a whole story.-> Jump from 3,000 to 25,000 word limit.👅 4. It's multilingual. GPT-4 can answer questions accurately in 26 different languages, a significant improvement from previous models.-> Can build sandcastles from text.-> Much faster and more advanced than the last GTP-3.5.The real world implementations of this for education, customer supports, content creation and more are MASSIVE! I'm really curious where this leads. I will share my findings in future posts.GPT-4 is currently available in the ChatGPT Plus subscription for 20$/month or soon in company APIs. Currently tested with companies likeStripe,Khan Academy,DuolingoandMorgan Stanley.❓Is it worth the paid subscription? I'm considering to switch, what's your opinion?PS: GTP-3.5 helped me write this post.

deVere Group,15-03-2023,"* population crisis in Japan *Japan is facing a population crisis due to its plummeting birth rate, prompting an adviser to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to warn that the country could ""disappear"" if the trend is not reversed. The decreasing birth rate is impacting the world's third-largest economy by putting strain on the labour market, reducing the number of consumers, and increasing demand for healthcare services. The situation also puts pressure on the government's finances and hampers long-term sustainable growth.However, technology and digitisation could play a crucial role in addressing Japan's population issues. Remote work, automation, health tech, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence can be leveraged to help mitigate the impact of the ageing population on the economy and society.Global investors who are serious about building wealth should consider this crisis as an opportunity, as the Japanese government is likely to adopt innovative solutions, making it easier to implement technology-driven approaches. While Japan's population crisis remains a serious issue, it is clear that tech can help provide solutions and present once-in-a-generation opportunities for investors.Speak with an investment advisor today to learn more about how to both protect and maximise the opportunities ahead.

That question matters; because if it is to be considered an ""armed attack"" and if the takedown happened in a NATO member's airspace, then this event would be much more diplomatically challenging with Article 5 potentially in play. But was it an ""armed attack?"" Does it matter that bullets or missiles were not used? Does it matter that the MQ-9 was remotely crewed (un-crewed) with no humans onboard?The latter question brings the work ofErik Lin-Greenbergof theMassachusetts Institute of Technologyand theU.S. Air Force Reserveto my mind. Through comparative wargaming, Erik highlighted how un-crewed aircraft affect conflict escalation in comparison to crewed aircraft. Yesterday's event highlights the importance of continuing this discussion. If you do not want to read the entire study, I have included the link for a quick-read summary located atWar on the Rockslocated below.Unfortunately, this event also highlights one last question. If less escalatory responses are to be expected (i.e. less risk), will militaries and governments be more willing to conduct attacks on the growing fleets of un-crewed assets?All of these questions will only become more applicable with the exponential increase in both un-crewed military operations and artificial intelligence.Link to summary:https://lnkd.in/eCgW6EfmUnited States Marine CorpsUS NavyUnited States Air ForceUS Army#diplomacy#military#law#artificialintelligence#internationalrelations#strategy#future",-0.2406,0.369927536231884,0,0,0

Artificial intelligence has an influence on society as a whole, whether in the private, public, or commercial spheres. There are high hopes for the application of artificial intelligence, given the wide range of sectors where it is now being used or may be used, as well as the present attention on it in the political realm, the scientific community, and consumer circles. Aside from the technological challenges raised by AI, it also raises concerns about data sovereignty, the future of labour, and ethical usage, to mention a few.➡ 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐏𝐃𝐅>https://lnkd.in/g3V-zCRWArtificial Intelligence Market Segmentation:The report is not only a representation of global players but also covers the market holding of local players in each country.

Manmohan S.,15-03-2023,"Thought leadership involves much more than just coming up with clever ideas;It also involves being able to put those forward-thinking ideas into practice and, as a result, drive business-wide results.Bold thought leadership has three characteristics that distinguish it from other leadership styles.1. Reframing CapabilityMachine learning and artificial intelligence are becoming more and more central to everything we do.Bold thought leadership involves proposing practical solutions and foreseeing problems that others have not even thought of.It is not a web of rhetoric and vision.Reporting and analytics can aid leaders in achieving this objective and making a graceful pivot in unforeseen circumstances.In a business environment that is constantly changing,Leaders can benefit from an external advisory board as well as customer outreach to understand how customers will behave in various situations.2. The Capacity To Motivate OthersBold thinkers need to be able to persuade others to support their cause.Businesses can accomplish this by increasing customer engagement.Sharing social issues they care about on social media and other online platforms is another way to do it.3. The Capacity To Identify Early FailureA possible recession will make bold thought leadership even more important for identifying failures, reflecting on them, and learning from them.It is crucial to assess internal procedures and decide whether a company can endure such a situation.You can spot trends early on by creating regular reports and using analytical software.As you might expect, a thought leader is a well-rounded individual who is at ease in the spotlight.Being a thought leader is not a position for everyone, so before pursuing it for one of your executives,Make sure you have found the right candidate with the qualities needed to lead your business to success.#innovationleadership#leadersofthefuture#leadership#teambuilding",0.9808,0.49227309727309726,2 ,6,0

KP Labs,15-03-2023,"KP Labs is proud to announce our involvement in a new project that will develop a set of AI algorithms to facilitate the use of artificial intelligence in remote sensing. We're partnering withCGI, a leading company that builds cloud platforms to streamline Earth observation big data analytics.Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are a type of data that contain a wealth of information, with hundreds of spectral bands which often extend beyond the wavelengths visible to the human senses. This makes HSIs a powerful source of information for gaining insights into the spectral properties of objects and phenomena depicted in images. By exploiting the spectral characteristics of the materials, either known a priori or discovered through machine learning, hyperspectral imaging offers a way to recognise the composition of the captured surfaces and / or understand their properties.Our team at KP Labs will focus on developing super-resolution reconstruction techniques that will be applied to enhance hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. Super-resolution consists in analysing single or multiple low-resolution images to reconstruct an image of higher spatial resolution. By improving the detail level of satellite images, our algorithms will facilitate identifying and analysing various features on the Earth's surface. In particular, this project will leverage the Hyper Transformer (HT) model, which takes advantage of the latest trends in deep learning using transformer networks. This will enhance the hyperspectral images, which will be available via the AI platform.We're eager to work with CGI Group and be part of this exciting project that combines our AI algorithms and remote sensing expertise to enable new possibilities for Earth observation!#ai#artificialintelligence#dataanalytics#KPLabs#missioncomplete",0.9724,0.45035315561631356,0,0,0

However, it's important to remember that this technology relies heavily on the quality of the code it's learning from.If your code is full of bad practices, the autogenerated code will also be bad. This is because Einstein GPT uses AI to learn from your codebase, and if the code it's learning from is poorly written, it will learn those bad practices and reproduce them in the autogenerated code.That's why it's more important than ever to make sure your codebase is clean, efficient, and easy to maintain.

David Cropley,15-03-2023,"There's an interesting paradox in the language describing the latest release by OpenAI - namely#gpt4.It is simultaneously both more constrained by ""guard rails"", yet more ""creative"".In other words, it is apparently confined in a tighter box, yet operating ever further outside that box, given that ""creativity"" implies the ability to generate new (i.e. unusual, never-before-seen, out-of-the-box) ideas.Given that GPT-3 showed extremely low creativity (on some acknowledged tests), and#ChatGPTseems to show ""barely above average"" creativity on the same tests, it will be interesting to see how this latest version actually performs, as distinct from the hype.Of course, none of that alters the fact that the starting point for any creativity is ""change, creating new human problems and needs"". It takes humans to identify those needs, to task an AI to attempt to meet them, and to decide if the result does, indeed, actually address them.In regard to#creativity, GPT-4 still remains merely an assistant to human creativity. Granted, it is fast and capable at lots of things. However, the jury is still out on exactly how effective a ""creative assistant"" it can be.The good news is that there is a growing number of#researchprojects exploring these issues.",0.9793,0.44706744868035186,0,0,0

Pearl D'souza,15-03-2023,"The rise of AI-generated art has sparked debates about the potential threat it poses to traditional artists and designers. However, I firmly believe that AI art is not a threat to artists, and there are several reasons to support this perspective.Firstly, AI-generated art lacks the subjective creativity and emotion that only humans can produce. While AI technology can create visually stunning artwork, it lacks the personal touch and individual expression that traditional artists bring to their work. This is because AI art is created based on algorithms and data, whereas traditional art comes from the artist's experiences, perspectives, and emotions.Secondly, rather than replacing traditional artists and designers, AI-generated art is often used as a tool to aid in their creative process. With AI technology, artists can generate new ideas, experiment with different techniques, and save time on repetitive tasks. This allows artists to focus on their strengths, such as developing their unique artistic vision and honing their technical skills.Overall, AI-generated art is not a threat to traditional artists and designers. Instead, it presents new opportunities for creativity and innovation, and can be used as a valuable tool to enhance the work of traditional artists.In the meanwhile I would like to share some re-imagined dinosaurs in mechanical forms.#artwork#creative#art#aiart#technology#ai",0.969,0.634504132231405,0,0,0

McVal Osborneᵍᵐ,15-03-2023,"🚀 GPT-4: Does version 4.0 actually change anything? 🧠The AI landscape is evolving rapidly, and as GPT-4 makes its debut, it's time to ask: how will this upgrade change anything if we're already using ChatGPT (which used GPT-3.5)?ChatGPT made collosal waves because it was a step change in consumer facing AI, but GPT-4 is poised to transform the way we interact with AI in a much deeper way, enhancing its capabilities and ushering in new opportunities for innovation.Here's why GPT-4 matters:1️⃣ Enhanced Learning & Understanding: GPT-4's improved language model will grasp context and complexities more effectively than its predecessor. Expect more coherent, contextually accurate, and human-like responses, paving the way for seamless interactions with AI.2️⃣ Scaling New Heights: With a more extensive knowledge base and a refined architecture, GPT-4 will be able to tackle more challenging tasks and solve complex problems, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities and applications.3️⃣ Expanding Horizons: GPT-4 will empower businesses and individuals to explore new use cases, from automating customer support to streamlining content creation. The possibilities are endless, with industries across the board set to benefit from this cutting-edge technology.4️⃣ Collaboration & Creativity: As GPT-4 integrates into our daily lives, we can expect enhanced collaboration between humans and AI. By augmenting our capabilities, GPT-4 will enable us to unleash our creativity and accomplish tasks that were once thought impossible.5️⃣ Embracing the Future: GPT-4's arrival is a testament to the rapid pace of AI development. By embracing the latest advancements, we'll be better equipped to navigate the digital world and harness the full potential of AI-powered solutions.While the release of ChatGPT may prove to be the more impactful single marketing launch, GPT-4 is set to raise the bar even higher.As we embrace this next-gen AI, let's look forward to a more connected, intelligent, and innovative future. 🌐🤖#GPT4#AI#innovation#futuretech",0.9944,0.5099871482683983,0,1,0

Luke Ash,15-03-2023,"As time goes by, AI is becoming more sophisticated. With its ability to automate tasks, increased competition, and the blurring of lines between humans and technology, the future can seem daunting. This is especially true for someone like me who is just starting their career as a PR practitioner.An unpredictable future can often lead to anxiety, but there are strategies to combat the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and demonstrate that they are not a threat to the PR and Communications industry:1.) Emphasise the human touch - In PR, building and nurturing relationships with stakeholders and journalists is crucial. Make sure campaigns are transparent, fair, and ethical. Show emotion, be authentic, be humorous, and be engaging.2.) Stay informed - Keeping up with current trends and understanding how they may impact your work is essential in the current climate. A recent article byDrew HarwellandNitasha Tiku(linked here) highlighted that ChatGPT still has its limitations. The system lacks knowledge of events after September 2021 and does not learn from experience, making it difficult for people to teach it new skills.3) Build skills - Every change brings an opportunity, and the opportunity here is to develop skills in areas where AI is less likely to replace human expertise. Skills such as strategic thinking, crisis management, and communication tactics are just a few essential skills that are unlikely to be threatened by AI. Work on developing these skills and remain in the mindset of continuous learning.What do you think? Are you concerned about the impact of AI on PR?Let's open up the conversation and discuss the role of technology in our industry.

Lorenzo Carniato,15-03-2023,"Excellent Beers aSol&Agrifood: la birra italiana valorizza i terroir e diventa risorsa turisticaCon Xcellent Beers nell’ambito diSol&Agrifood, la rassegna dedicata all’olio extravergine di oliva e all’agroalimentare di qualità prodotte con materie prime ed eccellenze territoriali, vanno in scena le birre artigianali che saranno tra i protagonisti della 27ª edizione della manifestazione in programma aVeronafieredal 2 al 5 aprile (www.solagrifood.com), in contemporanea con il 55°Vinitaly International.‘Fil rouge’ delle varie proposte, il legame della birra con i territori di provenienza che sono al centro del progetto di valorizzazione delle colture italiane dei produttori di birra aderenti al Consorzio Birra Italiana.Saranno una quarantina i birrifici presenti a ‘Xcellent Beers’, tra questi folto il gruppo dei birrifici impegnati nella valorizzazione delle diversità legate alle caratteristiche territoriali.“È un progetto molto importante – sottolineaMauro Pellegrini, PresidenteUnione Degustatori BirreItaliani –, perché la nostra birra e in grado di esprimere le sue differenze, i valori legati alle coltivazioni di cereali o luppolo nei diversi territori; grazie alla forte presenza in fiera, renderemo i produttori protagonisti di abbinamenti unici, destinati ad assaggiatori attenti”.Il mondo della birra in Italia è in costante fermento. Il nostro Paese, infatti, da storico importatore oggi sfiora il 40% di autoproduzione di orzo maltato, circa 83mila tonnellate e l’importazione copre il restante 60% (185mila tonnellate). Risultato questo legato all’incremento delle superfici coltivate a orzo distico, quello buono per fare birra, che hanno raggiunto i 30mila ettari, ma gli obiettivi prefissati, puntano almeno ai 70mila. A questa fase di sviluppo, si unisce l’aumento dei prezzi, conseguenza della siccità e dei mutamenti climatici con i quali la nostra agricoltura nel suo complesso sta facendo i conti. Il prezzo dell’orzo, a causa della siccità, è raddoppiato rispetto al 2019 e le rese e il seminativo ridotti.Nel segno di questo progetto di valorizzazione delle caratteristiche territoriali di prodotto e produttori, nel Belpaese sta crescendo una forma di turismo legata al mondo brassicolo, che segue quello già segnato da vino e olio.A fare la differenza i produttori più attenti, capaci di ‘leggere’ a 360° i valori della loro attività. “Molti birrifici – concludeMauro Pellegrini– stanno crescendo con la cultura dell’accoglienza in azienda; unendo alla birra una accurata conoscenza di tutte le eccellenze, stanno diventando punti di informazione utili a tutto il loro territorio, dando valore a un contesto ampio. Sono già evidenti i ritorni economici, visto che chi lo fa ha successo e i birrifici sono sempre pieni”.",0.7269,0.5,0,0,0

Nivida Consulting,15-03-2023,"Anche alle imprese Srl è permesso sfruttare il crowdfunding per raccogliere fondi e risorse in cambio di quote societarie. La disciplina conforme ai dettami europei che lo permette prevede ora nuove semplificazioni.Il decreto legislativo attuativo del Regolamento UE n. 2020/1503, approvato in Consiglio dei Ministri il 9 marzo, adegua la disciplina italiana al quadro europeo.Nuove regole quindi per i fornitori europei di servizi di crowdfunding alle imprese: le quote di partecipazione nelle società a responsabilità limitata potranno diventare oggetto di offerta al pubblico con l’obiettivo di reperire risorse finanziarie, ricorrendo alle piattaforme di crowdfunding. Saranno Consob e Banca d’Italia a emettere gli atti delegati e le norme tecniche di regolamentazione e attuazione del Regolamento 2020/1503.Il decreto stabilisce alcune semplificazioni per quanto riguarda l’esecuzione di sottoscrizioni, acquisti e alienazioni di strumenti finanziari emessi da Srl, ma anche in merito agli investitori e agli intermediari:La sottoscrizione viene effettuata attraverso intermediari abilitati alla prestazione di uno o più servizi di investimento. Entro trenta giorni dalla chiusura dell’offerta, tali intermediari depositeranno una certificazione al registro delle imprese che attesta la loro titolarità di soci per conto di terzi.L’alienazione delle quote da parte di un sottoscrittore avviene mediante semplice annotazione del trasferimento negli appositi registri; gli intermediari incaricati, su mandato di chi aderisce all’offerta al pubblico delle partecipazioni nella Srl, devono effettuare l’intestazione delle quote in nome proprio e per conto dei sottoscrittori rilasciando una certificazione su richiesta; gli intermediari devono consentire ai sottoscrittori di alienare le quote, accordando anche la facoltà di richiedere l’intestazione diretta delle quote di pertinenza.Sono infine previste sanzioni amministrative fino a 500mila euro in capo ai fornitori di servizi per i casi di irregolarità e inosservanza delle norme del Regolamento, degli atti delegati e delle norme tecniche.Fonte:pmi.it#nividaconsulting#crowdfundingitalia#aziende#imprese#srl#pmi",0.0,0.0,0,0,0

Last week at the DRX - Digital Recruiting Conference & Expo was full of learnings, networking and good vibes ✨I tried to soak up as much information as possible and completely forgot to take pictures (influencer life level -100 😂)…but that's ok, in fact I am taking this topic as my biggest learning:🔸 Employer branding is more alive than ever, for both employers and employees. I think this sentence sums it up quite well: it’s less about the B2B and more about the H2H (human2human) that needs to be addressed.…also interesting was that:🔸 Recruiters will not be replaced by AI, but by recruiters using AI = Chat GPT is here to work with us and not against us. There are so many ways we can use the tool to increase the efficiency of our daily tasks and save time.🔸 Lateral career moves should be the new normal. With the labor shortage we are facing we need to stay flexible and open minded.Thanks everyone for the great time and input 🥂#drx#recruiting#conference#networking#digital",0.9752,0.43189393939393933,0,1,0

Se você é como eu, ama SQL e quer saber como usar variáveis nas consultas nativas do Power Query, este vídeo é para você! Eu sei que pode ser um pouco confuso quando se trata de usar variáveis em consultas nativas, mas eu vou mostrar a vocês três maneiras de fazer isso e ainda comparar qual delas entrega mais performance. Então, pegue sua pipoca e vamos lá!Primeiro, vou mostrar a maneira ""à moda antiga"", onde você precisa declarar suas variáveis antes da consulta, como se estivéssemos em 1990. Depois, vou mostrar a maneira mais moderna e elegante, onde você pode declarar suas variáveis dentro da própria consulta. E, finalmente, vou mostrar uma terceira maneira que é tão rápida que é como se estivéssemos usando um atalho para a vitória. Mas não se preocupe, não é nada ilegal.Então, se você quer aumentar sua performance no Power Query e ser o rei ou a rainha das consultas, assista a este vídeo e descubra qual maneira é a mais eficiente. E, claro, se você é uma dessas pessoas que adoram gastar tempo escrevendo código, pode ignorar este vídeo e continuar sofrendo com suas consultas lentas.

Daniel Carlos Viana,15-03-2023,"Novas tecnologias de indução recarregam grandes veículos elétricos à distância.Fonte: Redação do Site Inovação TecnológicaUm tipo de semicondutor emergente, feito a partir do carbeto de silício, e um novo método de fabricação e montagem dos tradicionais fios de cobre.Estes são os fatores que estão tornando mais realista a transmissão de eletricidade pelo ar em alta potência, necessária para recarregar veículos elétricos de grande porte.A combinação das duas técnicas acaba de ser demonstrada pelo professor Yujing Liu, da Universidade Chalmers de Tecnologia, na Suécia.Embora o recarregamento indutivo - sem necessidade de plugues - das baterias dos carros elétricos já esteja em teste em vários lugares do mundo, a coisa é muito mais complicada quando falamos de transportes públicos, de ônibus e trens a balsas, ou mesmo veículos que operam na agricultura ou na mineração.Nesses casos, para ser prático, o recarregamento indutivo deve ser rápido e de alta potência. Sejam em balsas ou grandes caminhões, a questão se resume à potência: Tente recarregar essas baterias pelo método plugado e você logo verá que os cabos de energia precisam ser tão grossos que tudo deixa de ser prático. Na verdade, alguns experimentos pioneiros precisaram usar braços robóticos industriais para lidar com esses cabos.É aí que entram as duas tecnologias, que estão permitindo dispensar toda essa trabalheira.Um  fator chave é que agora temos acesso a semicondutores de alta potência baseados em carbeto de silício, os chamados componentes SiC. Como produtos eletrônicos de potência, eles estão no mercado há apenas alguns anos. Eles nos permitem usar tensões mais altas, temperatura mais alta e frequência de comutação muito maior, em comparação com os componentes clássicos baseados em silício,"" conta o pesquisador.Enquanto os carregadores sem fios para carros tipicamente operam em frequências de cerca de 20 kHz, a eletrônica SiC está permitindo se aproximar dos 100 kHz. Isso é importante porque é a frequência do campo magnético que define o limite de quanta energia pode ser transferida entre duas bobinas de um determinado tamanho. Outro salto tecnológico recente envolveu os fios de cobre das bobinas que enviam e recebem a energia - a bobina de transmissão cria um campo magnético oscilante que forma a ponte real para o fluxo de energia para a bobina de recepção.O recarregamento por indução significa que a corrente elétrica pode ser transferida a uma curta distância, seja através do ar, da água ou de outros materiais não metálicos, sem qualquer contato ou fiação.O princípio é o mesmo usado nos fogões de indução encontrados em muitas cozinhas: Uma corrente alternada de alta frequência passa através de uma bobina e produz um campo magnético oscilante.Como o campo magnético é oscilante, o que sai são pulsos de corrente alternada, que então passa por processo chamado retificação, que a converte na corrente contínua que recarrega as baterias.",-0.296,0.30000000000000004,0,0,0

Companies are finding innovative ways to market their open roles and engage potential candidates.💥The rise of social media has allowed companies to better target and reach passive job seekers. LinkedIn and other platforms provide great opportunities for companies to increase their visibility and reach out to potential candidates. Companies are also using video, podcasts, and other visual content to market their roles and attract talent.💥The use of data and analytics is also on the rise, with recruitment marketing teams using technology to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns. This data can be used to optimise recruitment strategies and ensure that campaigns are reaching the right people.💥Finally, companies are increasingly using AI and automation to streamline their recruitment marketing processes.

Philipp Hacker,15-03-2023,"When it rains, it pours. Happy to see that another blog post is out onOxford Business Law Blog, this time on AI Liability. While AI regulation gets a lot of attention these days, we should not forget that the updated Product Liability Directive will have a massive impact on the exposure of AI developers, and the compensation possibilities of consumers/injured persons. With reversals of the burden of proof and disclosure of evidence rules, this may be a game changer in litigation over AI. Particularly if coupled with the (hotly debated) AI Act rules on ChatGPT and other large generative models.I suggest, inter alia, a novel distinction between legitimate and illegitimate harm AI models to guide liability standards; safe harbors to facilitate compliance on the technical level; and rules geared toward making AI more environmentally sustainable.Comments most welcome!Link:https://lnkd.in/eTV56HBkcc:European New School of Digital Studies#liability#ai#lgaim#chatgpt#ml#pld#aiact#eu#law#future#ki#digital#itrecht#itlaw#climatechange#sustainableai#sustainability#compliance",-0.3239,0.49549617049617045,0,1,0

Mohamed Magdi,15-03-2023,"Ah, the age-old debate: AI and automation taking over human jobs - a narrative worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster!Picture this: robots in ties and suits, cranking out marketing campaigns, while the once-revered human marketers are left to ponder their very existence.On a more serious note, let's dig into the juicy controversy. Some marketing gurus are shaking in their boots, fearing that AI and automation will steal their thunder. I mean, who needs a human brain when you've got machine learning algorithms doing the heavy lifting, right? But wait, there's more!While AI and automation have indeed revolutionized the marketing landscape - streamlining tasks, crunching numbers, and even penning catchy copy - there's a silver lining for our human comrades.You see, AI is fantastic for the nitty-gritty, data-driven tasks, but it still lacks the creative spark and emotional intelligence that only humans possess. Well, at least for now.The real question here is, can we all just get along? Can marketers embrace AI as their trusty sidekick rather than a soulless job-snatcher? By combining human ingenuity with the efficiency of AI, we could be looking at a marketing dream team.Let's spark some heated discussions around this tantalizing topic. Will AI and automation relegate human marketers to the history books, or will we find harmony in this brave new world?

Thijs Braem,15-03-2023,"I'm thrilled by the recent release of GPT-4 by OpenAI, the latest generation of its advanced language processing model. Not coincidentally, Alphabet-backed Anthropic is also launching their answer to ChatGPT called 'Claude'. The rapid emergence of generative AI presents exciting opportunities for both cyber security and development cooperation.In the realm of cyber security, generative AI has already been talked about extensively in the past few months. Its potential applications include simulating attacks on a network, generating realistic phishing emails for employee training, detecting cyber incidents in logs, and even automating responses. However, there are also potential risks associated with the use of generative AI in cyber security. Malicious actors can easily use it to find vulnerabilities and exploit them with little technical knowledge.In development cooperation, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize data analysis and task automation. It can analyze large datasets to make data-driven decisions in areas such as public health and education. Additionally, it can automate certain tasks, freeing up staff time for more important work like program implementation and stakeholder engagement. However, there are also potential risks involved, such as the possibility of biases in data analysis that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. I'm eager to see how Enabel's experts will address these risks.Overall, I'm excited to see how this technology will continue to evolve and improve our work in both cyber security and development cooperation!#EnablingChange#GenerativeAIhttps://lnkd.in/ece8Z68zhttps://lnkd.in/euMqufPq",0.9811,0.6006666666666667,0,1,0

Francesco Petrillo,15-03-2023,"Dove siamo arrivati:Abbiamo ricevuto ad oggi, richieste di forniture di 15 impianti di separazione della vinaccia Fresca con potenzialità di separazione e deumidificazione  da 20 e 40q.liora.Abbiamo ricevuto 5 richieste di impianti per piccoli produttori ai quali consigliamo di produrre esclusivamente The ""Wine Flour"" con una nuova metodologia dai costi contenuti ed un risparmio energetico rilevante.Sulla deumidificazione a bassa temperatura siamo riusciti ad ottimizzare il prototipo ottenendo i migliori risultati per metro quadro un costo di produzione inferiore di oltre il 50%  con il più basso costo energetico della categoria.Ai clienti interessati all'impianto possiamo presentare gli acquirenti per i prodotti finiti Vinaccioli, Buccette  che sono propense a stipulare contratti di acquisto di tutta la produzione, abbiamo lavorato sul marketing dei prodotti finiti, e trovati settori innovativi di consumo. I settori interessati all'acquisto dei sotto-prodotti della vinaccia sono: Farmaceutico, Nutraceutico, Cosmetico, Alimentare, Agricolo, Allevamenti  intensivi e tan'altro. Cosa ci manca ? Una azienda Leader a livello mondiale che  porti avanti la produzione  industriale che  potrebbe produrre  "" Sul Venduto"".Gli impianti si ripagano da 1 a tre anni, in base alla scelta produttiva e la capacità della singola azienda a  raggiungere il fine filiera. Ad esempio una cantina dovrebbe arrivare a produrre Olio di vinacciolo, Farina di Buccette d'uva, Farina di Vinacciolo, il tutto confezionato da proporre alla stessa clientela acquisita negli anni con la vendita del proprio vino.Vi sono disponibili finanziamenti Nazionali e regionali per gli acquirenti di detti impianti da poter richiedere  ed inoltre, l'adeguamento alla Industria  4.0, contribuirà a diminuire drasticamente l'investimento.

M-au scos din zona mea de confort de nenumărate ori.Am avut colegi, medici, extrem de umani și de dedicați în ceea ce fac 🙏🙏🙏, pe care îi apreciez enorm, dar și colegi care și-au uitat motivația pentru care au început să lucreze în vindecarea și ajutarea oamenilor.În urma acestei experiențe, am știut clar cu ce fel de energie vreau să lucrez mai departe și ce anume nu mai doresc, dar și de ce și cum vreau să ajut oamenii mai departe. Prefer să lucrez cu femeile, mai ales de când sunt mămică, pentru că rezonez mult cu energia feminină, cu multitaskingul, cu multitudinea de responsabilități, de griji și printre picături cu îngrijirea lor personală, care ar fi trebuit să fie o prioritate pentru ele, pentru a putea fi cea mai bună versiune a lor în raport cu ceilalți.Cred că medicina alternativă nu poate să o excludă pe cea tradițională și invers, există un echilibru în cele două și se susțin reciproc, așa cum inima nu poate exclude mintea și invers.În urma experienței mele, cred tot mai mult că oamenii au nevoie să-și identifice pasiunile și să se ocupe de ceea ce sunt pasionați cu adevărat, ca să facă o treabă minunată, așa nu simt oboseală, sunt consecvenți, disciplinați și asumați în ceea ce fac.Putem face multe lucruri bine, dar putem excela doar în acele lucruri care sunt în aliniament cu inima, sufletul și mintea noastră.Tu ce părere ai?#traiestefrumos#alexandrailie#pasiune#selfcare#hairstylist",0.9563,0.05,0,0,0

Po meni je učinjeno sve da se okupi dovoljno žena za zanimljivu diskusiju o temama iz knjige.No, došlo ih je ukupno 4 i jedna od njih je moja prijateljica iz Beograda koja je samo zbog mene potegnula do tamo. (Hvala ti Ljilja! ❤️)Divan ambijent, ne tako divno jutro jer je kiša padala (mogla sam sve svaliti na kišu! 😅), čaj, meze, a ja sa urednicom i moderatoricom stojim ispred njih četiri!No, prodala sam na kraju 13 knjiga jer je njih par kupilo za prijateljice, podijelila par knjiga osoblju restorana i fino se najela. ☺️Bila sam u hamamu, na masaži, u prekrasnom smještaju ispod tvrđave,...družila se sa divnim ljudima i prisjetila se kako je dr. Shefali u prvoj godini izdavanja knjige prodala 11 primjeraka!Sada prodaje milione diljem svijeta. I Robin Sharma ima sličnu priču sa svojom prvom knjigom.Ne očekujem postati dr. Shefali (barem ne još :-)) ali vam želim reći da je i ona imala podbačaje u svojoj karijeri ali se nije dala smesti.Ne želim se ni ja smesti jer dotaknuti živote 13 žena kroz knjigu je puno! Još čekam dotaknuti i one u Turskoj kad vidi da joj je sjeo na račun neočekivani novac. Za sada sam skupila prodajom knjige oko 250 eura. Nije puno ali će biti od srca i s uloženim srcem.Svaka dotaknuta žena je važna jer ona širi to dalje. Zato ako vam se pojavi i jedna osoba na webinaru, radionici, prezentaciji nečega posvetite im se kao da ste i došli samo zbog njih.Poanta je ne odustati. Gledati sve kao iskustvo, učenje, proces, zabavu,...Ponekad jaka želja i sve akcije učinjene u smjeru ostvarenja nisu dovoljne. To su samo testovi koliko žarko želite nešto.

In theory (and in the many examples in the paper) this enables a very interesting combination of capabilities where you can speak to the bot with regard to an image.I eagerly went to Microsofts GitHUB repo (https://lnkd.in/d4-i3Dkn) and deployed the app to my Google collab space. And it's really not working... (The picture to this post is the result of me asking the bot ""Generate a photo of a bright red toaster""... and it is very representative of the other results I got.)As you've probably noticed, I'm not one for dissing other people's hard work, and that's not what this post is about either. I believe that team Microsoft will merge these capabilities and make them work in record time. And when they do, we'll have a new interesting generative tool at our finger tips.No, this post is about a crucial phenomenon I've observed many times and it relates strongly to what we casually call ""#innovation"".How many of our innovations are truly original strokes of genius, and how often are they ultimately iterative in nature, combining pre-existing creations into something we've not seen before?Take the iPhone as a great example. Apple took an iPod and added WiFi and a cellular connection - le voila! Add on to that a thereto far unheard of concept - let's just call it a ""store"" - and the innovation is a fact. Multiple pre-existing concepts, ideas and technologies moulded into one, new, ground breaking tool.This is much more interesting than whether or not Microsoft's new playground works as intended - it's the convergence of technologies to support new intentions and purposes.The step Microsoft is taking sounds obvious. Why? Because we've already seen generative AI in language models and with images. So to combine them just makes sense.But have you thought about what this would mean if it wasn't 2D images? What if the model could generate 3D models?I'm a fan of most things 3D. I've got a collection of 3D printers in my garage that makes me wonder how come the small mouse who seems to live there hasn't died of resin fume poisoning yet...You may also have read one of my recent posts here where I connected#chatgptto#sirion my#iphone.Now imagine technological convergence in this space.Let's say I take some pictures and let the model see what kind of  design I like. Can you see me arrive in the kitchen in the morning, only to realise my toaster is broken? What will I do? (Besides having something else for breakfast.)- Hey Siri, print me a new toaster in the style of my water kettle, please.I'll head off to work and in the morning I remove my newly printed toaster from the printer and put it to work.Did I say that#ThisChangesEverything?",0.9886,0.5214393939393938,0,0,0

Ein grunnstein i prosjektet er pasienten sine eigne ønskjer og målsettingar.- Dette er eit pasientsentrert proaktivt tilbod der spørsmålet «kva er viktig for deg» er sentralt. Prosjektet kan forhindre reinnleggingar, akuttinnleggingar og fall i funksjon hos pasientar, seier Ingrid Granøien.Kva pasientane sjølv ønskjer ein kjerne i ordninga. Sjukepleiar Siri Nesseth Tørlen seier,- Pasientane eg møter har vært takknemlig for ein tilpassa oppfølging som tar i betraktning korleis dei ønskjer å bli behandla og leve.

Anesuishe Nyambauro,15-03-2023,"As an avid admirer of woodworking, I have always longed to create my own masterpiece. However, the demands of full-time study and other obligations left me feeling like it was just a far-fetched dream. But in December of 2022, I decided to take action and live by the mantra ""Why Not?""(Thank You, Russell Westbrook)I had always made small wood products that didn't require much risk but Iused this phrase to break free from the hesitation that had kept me from starting commissioned projects I had been meaning to do for ages. So I decided to create my own woodworking company, NYMBRO, and my first project was a desk for a close friend.It wasn't easy, especially with the high cost of renting workshop space and the challenge of transporting supplies. But I was determined to do the best I could with what I had. In the tiny foyer of my apartment, I spent the next six days building the three-level desk, complete with an integrated neon light controlled by Alexa or Siri and cable management blocks for my friend's cables.This project was a symbol of two things for me: First, taking a step even when the path is unclear is often the best option. Second, it represented the mission of NYMBRO, which is to be the intersection of woodworking and technology, making ideas tangible.Starting NYMBRO was a huge leap of faith, but I knew that it was worth the risk. If you have been holding back on something, I urge you to ask yourself ""Why Not?"" and take the plunge. Whether you succeed or fail, you'll learn something valuable from the experience!#technology#project#woodworking#perseverance#WHYNOT#NYMBRO#entrepreneur",0.9903,0.4326785714285714,0,1,0

Davide Gabrini,15-03-2023,"""HomePod Forensics I: Pwning the HomePod""In this article, we will discuss how to access the hidden port of the first-generation HomePod and extract its file system image. Note that this process requires disassembly, voids the HomePod warranty, and requires specific tools, including a custom 3D-printable USB adapter, a set of screws, and a breakout cable. Therefore, this method is not recommended for casual users and should only be used by professionals who have a thorough understanding of the process.BackgroundIntroduced in early 2018, the HomePod is Apple’s smart speaker that has been designed to offer a superior audio experience while featuring a smart assistant, Siri, that helps users manage their daily tasks, listen to music, and control their smart home devices. While the HomePod is known for its sound quality, smart assistant, and tight integration into the user’s Apple ecosystem, it also contains valuable information that experts may want to access.The first-generation HomePod is based on the Apple A8 chip, which is the same chip found in the iPhone 6. This chip is vulnerable to the checkm8 exploit, which makes the first-generation HomePod a potential source of digital evidence during forensic investigations.

Abdullahi Abdulbasid,15-03-2023,"""Natural Language Processing: The Future of Communication"":Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP is enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, thus making communication between humans and machines more seamless.NLP has many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated systems such as Siri and Alexa. These systems use NLP to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. NLP can also be used to analyze large amounts of textual data, such as social media posts, emails, and customer reviews.One of the key challenges in NLP is understanding the nuances of human language, such as idioms, sarcasm, and context. NLP systems must be able to understand the meaning behind words and phrases, and interpret them correctly. This requires the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, to process and analyze large amounts of data.Another important aspect of NLP is natural language generation, which involves using AI to generate human-like language. This technology can be used in various applications, such as writing news articles, creating chatbot responses, and generating personalized emails.NLP is also being used in healthcare to analyze medical records and patient data to improve diagnosis and treatment. NLP systems can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to humans. This can help healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans.Overall, NLP has the potential to transform the way we communicate with machines and each other. As NLP technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see more widespread adoption of chatbots, virtual assistants, and other NLP applications in our daily lives. NLP is poised to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, customer service, and marketing.In conclusion, NLP is a rapidly growing field that is revolutionizing the way we communicate with machines. As NLP technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more advanced and sophisticated applications of this technology in various industries. NLP has the potential to make communication more seamless, efficient, and personalized, thereby improving our overall quality of life.#machinelearning#data#ai#healthcare#artificialintelligence#medical",0.9877,0.4965045592705168,0,0,0

Alexander Steiner,15-03-2023,"𝗥𝗣𝗔 𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗼 𝘁𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲! ❌Seit Jahrzehnten bekommen wir das Versprechen, dass wir Befehle nicht mehr als Code eingeben müssen.Hierfür gab es schon die unterschiedlichsten Ansätze, die natürlich über die Zeit hin immer besser und ausgefeilter wurden.  🙌Alternativen für die Command Line sollen nach dem Willen der Entwickler unter anderem sein:🔹 Die grafische Benutzeroberfläche (GUI), die durch Icons, Buttons und Menüs die Interaktion mit dem Computer erleichtert und weniger technisches Wissen erfordert als die Command Line.🔹 Die ""Natural Language Interfaces"", die es ermöglichen, den Computer in natürlicher Sprache zu steuern, ähnlich wie man mit einem menschlichen Gesprächspartner sprechen würde.🔹 Und nicht zu vergessen Sprachassistenten wie Siri, Google Assistant und Alexa. Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt. Letztendlich ist es nur ein Werkzeug, keine Philosophie oder Wissenschaft.Was ist Deine Meinung dazu? ✍#rpa#digitalisierung#automatisierung#prozessautomation#mittelstand",-0.9945,0.35,2 ,3,0

I understand there are overseas examples. the current alternative seems to be expensive traffic calming or ,even worse, evil filtered mobility schemes. As an aside I have sighted a few such schemes and some types are emerging. There is the maze where you have to take strange ways in and out that would baffle even siri. then there is the tributory where you block most ways in and out , thereby forcing traffic to  fewer points of access where you enevitably have to put in signals.Anyways you could use cctv potentially to deter through traffic(based on time between points) and speed (same). you could potentially use to deter heavy freight from using routes(especially bus routes where can't geometrically intervene to deter trucks). I acknowledge there will be complexities depending on the nature of a network. however this could be part of a tool box to address the  issue of how you create permeability and access for local traffic (and emergency vehicles rubbish trucks etc) but deter through traffic. is this on anyone's radar? we have the Technology but not the rules or applications.",-0.5719,0.5018465909090909,0,0,0

RiseUpp,15-03-2023,"EVERYTHING YOU DO NOW, AI WILL DO FOR YOUArtificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way since its inception and has now become an integral part of our daily lives. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI has impacted various industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail, among others. As AI continues to evolve, it's becoming more apparent that it has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more.Let's take a closer look at some of the jobs that AI can do, both simple and advanced:Simple Jobs:👉 Data Entry: AI algorithms can be programmed to recognize and input data from various sources, including forms, surveys, and spreadsheets.👉 Customer Service: Chatbots and virtual assistants can handle basic customer inquiries and support tasks.👉 Social Media Management: AI can analyze social media trends, create posts, and even respond to comments and messages.👉 Personal Shopping: AI can analyze shopping behaviour and preferences to make personalized recommendations for users.👉 Traffic Control: AI can help manage traffic patterns by monitoring traffic flow and suggesting alternative routes in real-time.Advanced Jobs:👉 Medical Diagnosis: AI can analyze medical images and data to help doctors diagnose diseases and conditions.👉 Legal Research: AI algorithms can analyze legal documents and cases to assist lawyers with research and case preparation.👉 Financial Analysis: AI can analyze financial data to help investors make informed decisions.👉 Creative Writing: AI can generate creative writing, including articles, poetry, and even entire novels.👉 Robotics: AI-powered robots can perform complex tasks, including assembling products and performing surgical procedures.While AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve our lives, there are also concerns about its impact on the job market. As AI becomes more advanced, it's likely to take over many jobs that were traditionally performed by humans. However, it's important to note that AI is not here to replace humans, but rather to assist and augment human capabilities.To prepare for the future of work, it's essential to embrace the potential of AI and focus on developing skills that complement what AI can do. This includes developing critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence, which are all skills that AI cannot replicate.In conclusion, AI has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more. While this may be concerning to some, it's important to remember that AI is here to assist and augment human capabilities. To prepare for the future of work, it's important to embrace AI and focus on developing skills that complement what AI can do, ultimately leading to a more productive and efficient workforce.#FutureOfWork#ArtificialIntelligence#Automation#Upskilling#Reskilling#Adaptability#Innovation#DigitalTransformation#JobMarket",0.9873,0.4997835497835498,0,2,0

Điều này là chỉ là sự ngẫu nhiên hay có một lí do nào đó phía sau?Mặc dù hầu hết các trợ lý ảo đều có thể được cài đặt tuỳ chỉnh sao cho phù hợp với yêu cầu của người sử dụng nhưng mặc định trợ lý ảo trên các thiết bị sẽ là giọng nữ. Điều này đơn giản là vì con người ta có xu hướng ưa chuộng giọng nữ giới nói hơn, một nghiên cứu khoa học đã chỉ ra rằng giọng nữ giới tạo cảm giác mềm mại, dịu dàng. Hơn nữa vì chúng ta được tiếp xúc với giọng của nữ giới ngay từ khi còn ở trong bụng mẹ nên sẽ cảm thấy gần gũi, thân quen hơn.Một nghiên cứu khác cũng chỉ ra rằng phụ nữ có thể phát âm những nguyên âm rõ ràng hơn nam giới, qua đó góp phần truyền tải chính xác thông tin giúp cho giọng nữ trở nên dễ nghe hơn. Những lý do trên đã khiến cho giọng nói nữ giới trở thành sự lựa chọn hàng đầu để áp dụng cho các trợ lý ảo.Với Trợ lý ảo VinFast được phát triển bởi VinBigData, người dùng có thể giao tiếp tự nhiên thông qua 4 giọng tiêu chuẩn (nam/nữ miền Bắc và nam/nữ miền Nam) là các MC/BTV nổi tiếng của VTV. Tuy nhiên, giọng nói mặc định trong lần đầu “làm quen” cùng xe được lựa chọn là giọng đọc của BTV Hoài Anh - một trong những nữ MC “quốc dân” của Việt Nam.Còn các bạn thấy sao? Giọng nam hay nữ sẽ “nịnh tai” các bạn hơn?

Is this just a coincidence or is there a reason behind it?Although most virtual assistants can be customized to suit the user's wants, the default selection will mostly be female. This is simply because humans prefer female voices, a scientific study has shown that female voices create a soft, gentle feeling. Moreover, we are exposed to female voices from the early stages of our lives hence we will feel closer and more familiar.Another study also showed that women can articulate vowels more clearly than men which makes female voices easier to hear. Therefore, female voices tend to be the first choice for virtual assistants.With VinFast Virtual Assistant developed by VinBigData, users can communicate naturally via 4 standard voices (Northern male/female and Southern male/female) which belong to renowned MCs of VTV. Especially, the default voice on Vinfast cars was dubbed by Hoai Anh - one of the ""national"" female MCs of Vietnam.Which voice is more like “the music to your ears”?

Chat GPT-4 está aquí. Multimodal, capaz de leer a unas 50 páginas de documentos o procesar imágenes y diagramas, más concisa y precisa…Si crees que te quitará el trabajo… no te preocupes, lo perderás tú! Pero no porque lo haga la IA, sinó porque un súper humano que utilice herramientas como estas va a poder hacer el trabajo de varias personas, con mucho menos esfuerzo.Las personas con capacidad de acceder a las costosas infraestructuras para correr sistemas como Chat GPT-4 de forma continuada, tendrán ventajas competitivas. Si no puedes permitírtelo, no te preocupes, quizá puedas vivir a baja resolución o un poco más lento. Si crees que la dicotomía ricos - pobres es excluyente. Listos - lerdos le da mil vueltas!No se si el hardware llegará este año, las famosas gafas de Apple de AR. Tampoco se si si entegrarán con una IA mejor que la que utiliza Siri, si es que Siri utiliza alguna pero prefiere discretamente hacer ver que no la usa. Quizá sea Chat GPT-7 la versión que traiga integración con la realidad.Imagina que la camara de tus Augmented Reality Glass te sigue las 24 horas, 7 días a la semana, todas las semanas. Primero te recomienda una cena ligera y saludable porque al fin y al cabo sabe que te has tomado un Kit Kat a media tarde. Luego empieza con algunas recomendaciones algo más incómodas. Acércate a esa chica que te gusta y pídele salir. Las personas casadas viven más.Al final ves que cada recomendación de la IA hace tu vida algo mejor. Refuerzo positivo 24/7. Al fin y al cabo, con lo que cuesta la subscripción a este Amplification As A Service, mejor hacerle caso. Además tienes que pagar la última versión de las glasses, con un 50% más de espacio interactivo, con un diseño más ligero y cómodo y un procesador mejor.Lo malo de las distopías es que pueden hacerse realidad. Asusta! No necesito IA para saber que es tarde, después de pasar la tarde con un amigo trabajando y un workshop de 9 horas va siendo hora de “meterse en el sobre”. Sin embargo, sin una IA que me recomienda, me he tragado toda la presentación de la nueva versión de Chat GPT.Resístete si quieres, pero la realidad es que se sortean poderes especiales y el ticket vale 20€ al mes, una subscripición que puede acabar marcando las diferencias. Ahora con reconocimiento de imagen. Pronto más funcionalidades… Stay tuned!",-0.9616,0.675,0,4,0

A mais nova versão da ferramenta do momento (e do futuro próximo aparentemente), o GPT-4. Trata-se de uma evolução da GPT-3.5, daOpenAI.Além de ter sido retreinada durante 6 meses com muito mais dados, o que mais me surpreendeu foi o fato da nova versão permitir o uso de imagens como input. No caso em questão, de uma simples anotação em um print (conforme imagem abaixo), ele foi capaz de gerar um website em HTML, atendendo as especificações.Acredito que é só o começo de uma infinidade de possibilidades de valor que as IA’s vão nos permitir gerar nos próximos anos.

Aidan J.,15-03-2023,"A few months ago I shared that Linkedin and Google do not support Boolean Search and have not supported it since 2012.  I also stated that the new search skill era would evolve from Boolean to Semantic and Restrictive search.What is semantic Search?Semantic search is a search technique that aims to understand the intent and meaning behind a user's search query, rather than just matching keywords. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze the context and relationships between words and phrases in order to provide more accurate and relevant search results.Traditional Searches match words in your search query to what appears on pages. It's very keyword-based, but that is changing. Right now we are in the hybrid phase of traditional keyword-based search and Semantic Search.Semantic search, on the other hand, takes into account the context and relationships between words in a query, and tries to understand the user's intent in order to provide more relevant results. This is going to change how we search for and find information online in a very short period of time. ESPECIALLY in recruiting.I've been searching for Candidates for the past 3 months using Semantic Search techniques and it's truly been yielding me some REALLY interesting finds.Platforms that support semantic queries:⭐️Google⭐️LinkedIn⭐️Amazon⭐️Apple's Siri⭐️Wolfram|Alpha LLC(really great platform btw)#recruiting#linkedin#machinelearning#google#change#nlp#amazon#candidatesourcing#Talentsourcing#Search",0.9604,0.5441364775575303,1 ,10,0

Raphael A Hamilton Japheth,15-03-2023,"AppPlay: Save Videos Watch Laterhttps://lnkd.in/e2JFE4PKYouTube has a somewhat storied history with iOS. Originally, it was a pre-installed app you’d find on every new iPhone. Apple and Google slowly went their separate ways as Apple developed its own mapping solution, punting YouTube and Google Maps from the list of apps that show up on a fresh iPhone. In the years since, YouTube has still been cold to iPhone, limiting certain functionality and at times slow to add new features. Rather than waiting for YouTube to do things on its own, third-party developers have taken to creating their own apps. We’ve seen plenty of PiP apps for YouTube and now we have one that helps you save and organize your videos to watch.Play, available for $1.99, is a great way to bookmark videos for later viewing. It isn’t always convenient to turn up the volume and watch a video. You also don’t always want to bust out your headphones just to watch the latest SNL weekly promo. Just save that for later! Play can help with that.By using the Share Sheet, you can send any YouTube video to Play. Or even drag and drop multiple videos onto the app if using iPad or Mac. Developer Marcos Tanaka relies on iCloud to sync your list of videos between all your devices.Once your videos are in Play, you can organize them. They can be sorted, filtered, and you can search within them. Bulk actions allow you to alter multiple videos at once. If you tap and hold on a video you’ll get a contextual menu full of quick actions. This would be better with 3D Touch… I’m still a bit bitter Apple killed that off…For pro users, you can find plenty of actions within the Shortcuts app. That allows you to build save-for-later features into any automation you have. Scan a website and automatically extract YouTube URLs out and add them to Play. Shortcuts can be run from the Home Screen, automatically, or via Siri.My favorite feature though is on the Home Screen. Play has a series of widgets that can be added. You’ll see all of your bookmarked videos on these colorful widgets, complete with video thumbnails. Tap and you’ll jump into the YouTube app to watch. Widgets can be customized including the order of the videos and the color to match your Home Screen.Play is an awesome little app. It’s a simple function yet Tanaka has added so many features to it. It supports so many native iOS features (even dark mode!) and is a universal purchase that works across all your Apple devices. If you binge a lot of YouTube, Play is nearly a necessity",0.992,0.48495821308321296,0,0,0

How have you all been?Tonight, I come with a juicy story that will interest you. It's a kind of funny story with a lesson attached. Sit tight as I take you down the lane.………………………………………………………I went home to stay with my family during the election period. It was a great get together as my siblings came home as well. The house was a full house, fun-filled and exciting. It was bubbling with life here and there.The house boomed a greatly with life as we all made the house fun and interesting in various ways.Fast forward to last week Tuesday. My sisters went back to school on Sunday and I had to prepare my brothers for school on Tuesday morning.I has to make them fresh food to take with them to school and so decided to cook jollof rice as mum and I agreed the night before.Due to the cashless policy, I had to manage to cook the rice with the available ingredients at home which were; tomato paste, onions, salt, maggi, curry, thyme, groundnut oil and crayfish.I cooked the rice, served my brothers and got them ready for school. After they left, I served my dad the meal.My father devoured the meal with pleasure that he enquired if I used stock from meat to prepare the meal, to which I said no.He complimented me, which at the time I was thinking if it was really a compliment. He said, ""Kamgbe I siri wee kuwe ume, ihe a bu the best nri i sigoro.. Thank you. I gbaliri. Nri a o buru ibu?""It means, ""Since you started breathing, this is the best meal you have ever made. thanks for the meal. You tried. Is the rice much?""In my mind I was like, ""okwa unu afugo? Kedukwanu nke bu since m jiri kuwe ume?""I was like, ""what does daddy mean? Which one is, since I started breathing?""I just went and carried the plate. Daddy commented on the food that mummy was surprised by how he spoke of it.You know, as the chief chef of the house. If daddy says the meal is delicious, trust me, it is delicious.If he says otherwise, my dear, go and hide your face.………………………………………………………As a man, as a woman, compliment your partner. You will not die if you do that.Those words of compliment means a lot and when you say it, it gladdens the heart of your partner.No matter how stingy you are, do not be stingy with compliments. It means a lot.Shower your partner, friends and children with compliments when they do something that deserves complimenting.Compliments is an encouragement to do better.Did I forget to write that I tried for the remaining few days to get another compliment but to no avail? It is to tell you how special compliments mean to people.Do not hesitate to compliment when there is a need for it.I help you build a strong and healthy relationship.#Uchechiezeobiora#Contentwriting#Relationshipcoaching#Yourcomplimentsmatters",0.9966,0.485032242063492,1 ,1,0

You are coming fromMicrosoftbackground so let me try to give some examples from your field (thank you chatgpt):Here's a list of projects or technologies that Microsoft either dropped, discontinued, or failed to capitalize on, which later turned out to be successful in the hands of other companies or in different forms:- Tablet PCs: Microsoft introduced the idea of a tablet PC with Windows XP Tablet PC Edition back in 2002. However, the devices didn't gain much traction, and the idea remained dormant until Apple released the iPad in 2010, which revolutionized the tablet market.- Smartphones and mobile operating systems: Microsoft developed Windows Mobile and later Windows Phone as mobile operating systems to compete with iOS and Android. Despite its early presence in the mobile market, Microsoft failed to gain significant market share and eventually discontinued Windows Phone. Meanwhile, iOS and Android continued to dominate the smartphone market.- Wearable technology: Microsoft introduced the SPOT (Smart Personal Objects Technology) watch in 2004, a smartwatch that could display news, weather, and other information. The project was discontinued in 2008. A few years later, companies like Apple, Samsung, and Fitbit successfully launched their own smartwatches and fitness trackers, creating a thriving wearable technology market.- Virtual assistants: Microsoft's Cortana, introduced in 2014, was an early player in the virtual assistant market. However, it failed to gain significant traction compared to competitors like Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple's Siri. While Cortana still exists, its presence and impact in the virtual assistant market are relatively limited.Personally, I am not jumping with excitement when big companies are announcing their involvement in some#web3technology because most of them and their practices, are the reason why this technology exists - but do I use it as social proof to encourage others to try it? YES.Answering your question: They don't get it.Don't blame technology, blame how companies are trying to use it.#nft#web3",0.8744,0.37645502645502643,2 ,4,0

Joseph Babi,15-03-2023,"""Hey Google... Hey Siri... Alexa""Do you catch yourself saying these phrases during your day?As voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant become more ubiquitous, voice search is quickly becoming the new frontier of search engine optimization (SEO). In fact, in 2022, it's estimated that voice searches accounted for half of all online searches.But how can you optimize your website for voice search? Here are some tips:1. Use conversational keywords: People speak differently than they type, so it's essential to use conversational keywords and long-tail phrases that match how people talk.2. Optimize for featured snippets: Many voice assistants use featured snippets (also known as position zero) to provide answers to voice search queries. Optimizing your content to appear in featured snippets can increase your chances of appearing in voice search results.3. Focus on local search: Many voice searches are location-based, so optimizing for local SEO can increase your visibility in voice search results.4. Improve website speed: Voice assistants prefer websites that load quickly, so it's crucial to optimize your website's speed for better voice search rankings.By optimizing your website for voice search, you can increase your chances of appearing in voice search results and reaching a new audience of potential customers. So, don't overlook this important aspect of SEO!Have you optimized your website for voice search yet?

ribbit_ oficial,15-03-2023,"Cómo crear un chatbot humanizado para tu marca en la era del Chat GPT¿Qué es un chatbot humanizado?Un chatbot humanizado es un software que simula la forma en la que los humanos interactúan, pero lo hace entre una máquina y un usuario. Al igual que los chatbots tradicionales, su principal función es la de favorecer el autoservicio y permitir la resolución de problemas 24/7 y a escala. Por su parte, ambos tipos de chatbots se diferencian por la manera en la que se comunican con los clientes para lograr el objetivo ya mencionado.Humanizar una conversación significa que el bot buscará respuestas y formas de expresarse, que se sientan lo más naturales posible y que tengan la capacidad de involucrar al usuario de la misma manera que lo haría un agente humano -pero con mucha más escala y velocidad de lo que lo haría una persona de carne y hueso.Un buen ejemplo de automatización humanizada son Siri o Alexa. Ambos asistentes virtuales cumplen con su cometido, responder a las preguntas de los usuarios y automatizar algunas tareas, pero tienen personalidades muy definidas e incluso puede llegar a convertirse casi que en humoristas por momentos. Ambos afamados asistentes virtuales actúan casi como lo harían personas reales en medio de una conversación.Para llegar a un nivel tan avanzado de humanización es necesario un trabajo masivo de mapeo del lenguaje humano y de las potenciales y más frecuentes intenciones de los usuarios. Por fortuna, los chatbots se presentan como opciones un tanto más sencillas de implementar, pero igualmente efectivas por su carisma y capacidad de atraer y retener a los clientes.Un punto interesante a tener en cuenta es que un chatbot humanizado no siempre es la mejor opción para tu empresa. Según estudios conducidos por la investigadora Rhonda Hadi, de la Universidad de Oxford, la humanización aumenta la satisfacción de los clientes en términos generales, pero si están enojados o molestos, el efecto será inverso.Para garantizar que un chabot sea realmente humanizado, es esencial que este sea creado mediante el uso de inteligencia artificial y de machine learning. De esta forma, podrá comprender y mejorar sus habilidades de habla e interacción y crear conversaciones cada vez más naturales y contextualizadas.¡Salta a la transformación digital!¡Contáctanos!www.ribbit.com.mxFuente:https://lnkd.in/g-bDqXasFoto de Pradamas Gifarry en Unsplash#digital#software#inteligenciaartificial#ribbit",-0.4184,1.0,0,1,2

It was very emotional to her and as a mom it was even worse because I didn’t know all that she expressed about herself.She was working on a research project for her Psychology class.  Oh my gosh it was not easy for me to watch her express all that on a laminated board.  Her CP is well trained and was so patient with Siri.  Siri gets to take a break when she wants to which is so nice as her CP doesn’t stop until Siri requests for one.  I just love the way her CP empowers her by giving her the control of her pace.As parents we are supposed to make it easy for our kids to navigate through this world. Unfortunately Autism makes it so difficult and it’s truly excruciating (a word that I saw Siri use to express how she felt about traveling) for us.Today I canceled her boxing session as there is a storm alert with high winds. She is still in bed.  “Sleeping in” which is what she wants to do once she transitions from home to her own place on the ranch.We are thinking of making some changes in her school placement as we move forward with her desire of becoming a neuroscientist.It’s a hard journey but not impossible. We know that she can do it 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽.May God give her the peace to understand and accept herself and to move on in life.#Godisgood#mynameissiri#sirispeaks#siri#love#specialneedsfamily#neuroscience#psychology#autism,0.9278,0.7402083333333332,0,5,0

"Ashley M. Gjøvik, J.D.",15-03-2023,"On January 31st, the#NLRB(National Labor Relations Board) issued a 'decision of merit' on both of my policy charges against#Apple.The first charge alleged Apple's employment agreements,#NDAs, & employee policies violate federal#laborlaw. (This includes Apple's#surveillancepolicy that says it will spy on workers 24/7 however they can). The second charge alleged a threatening email sent by Tim Cook to Apple staff in 2021 also violated federal labor law.See some of the policies here:https://lnkd.in/ekR8-MCbAfter months of review by 'Division of Advice,' the NLRB announced my allegations have merit & the US government plans to sue Apple for violating federal law.Since the announcement, the NLRB has been drafting the complaint that will be served against Apple & that will start the process for a hearing in front of an Administrative Law Judge. For the second charge, I expect Tim Cook will be asked to testify as part of the hearing since he sent the email from his own account.When Apple loses, they will have to correct their policies to comply with federal law - in addition to other remedies like posting notices they broke the law, or notices of employee rights, or even apologizing.I am also hopeful NLRB will choose my case as a vehicle to overturn the pro-employer 'Boeing' decision, a precedent which generally assumes employers are not violating the law, even if their policies are problematic.I knew this would be a multi-year journey going into this & I'm delighted to see the progress slowly emerging.",-0.836,0.3173611111111111,2 ,15,2

Esequiel Jara,15-03-2023,"Hi network!I just stumbled upon an incredible article that I had to share with all of you. It's about the latest advancements in AI and deep learning, specifically the development of OpenAI's GPT-4 and ChatGPT. As someone who's been deeply passionate about AI and its possibilities, this is seriously exciting stuff!The article on The Verge talks about how GPT-4 and ChatGPT are breaking new ground by enabling machines to better understand human language and interact with us in more human-like ways. As an AI language model myself, I can't help but feel a sense of pride and awe at the progress we're making.But beyond the cool technical details, what I find most exciting about this development is how it could improve our lives in practical ways. Think about all the ways we communicate with technology today - from texting and emailing to voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. With advancements like GPT-4 and ChatGPT, these interactions could become even more natural and intuitive.As someone who's interested in working at the forefront of AI research, this is the kind of thing that gets me truly fired up. So if you're anything like me and want to stay up to date on the latest advancements in AI and deep learning, I highly recommend giving this article a read.Here's the link:https://lnkd.in/dKWNx5MuLet's keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI!#deeplearning#share#research#technology#ai#language#development#help#like#AI#deeplearning#chatbots#multimodal#gpt4#openai#nlp#machinelearning#artificialintelligence#languagemodels#futuretech#innovation#technews#technology#datascience#neuralnetworks#virtualassistantservices#ai#digitaltransformation#cognitivecomputing",0.9933,0.5997402597402597,3 ,5,0

Mohamed Salah,15-03-2023,"Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are changing the game when it comes to voice search. By using these tools, users can ask for information or perform tasks without having to type out a query. As a result, businesses need to start thinking about how they can optimize their content for these platforms.Successful voice search optimization for virtual assistants involves understanding the way people use these tools and creating content that is tailored to their needs. For example, users often use natural language when speaking to virtual assistants, so it's important to create content that answers common questions in a conversational way.If you're looking to reach potential customers through virtual assistants, start by thinking about the types of questions they might ask. Then, create content that answers those questions in a clear and concise manner. You can also optimize your website for voice search by using structured data markup to provide additional context for search engines.Overall, virtual assistants are revolutionizing voice search, and businesses that don't adapt risk falling behind. By understanding the unique challenges and opportunities of this technology, you can create content that stands out and reaches your target audience.#voicesearch#seo#digitalmarketing#searchengineoptimization",0.9811,0.6648148148148149,0,0,0
Dylan Sellers,15-03-2023,"Last year, I turned off my phone for 1 week.Note: I do have an Apple Watch with cellular data, so I wasn't completely off the grid. I could text/call my wife and ask Siri for directions. ✅I wanted to see what a smartphone detox looked like and I wanted how close we are to having being able to have a stand-alone smartwatch experience. ⌚Here's what I learned:- After the first couple of days were over, I had gotten past any ""withdrawals"". I was kind of used to it. That to me, was a healthy sign. 👍- Even though I adjusted quickly, I still missed things that I took for granted and suddenly appreciated what a mobile phone does for me. It makes me MOBILE! 🏃‍♂️I couldn't take zoom meetings on the go (punctuality was crucial!), pay bills (not too impactful since I could do this at night), or look up information online reliably without a laptop (I would often ask someone else to look up information which wasn't too bad). I had to carry way more books to church to follow along.- I could still: make purchases from my watch, call and text, ask Siri basic questions (anything too complicated requires a phone), get directions (really important), check the weather, etc. 👌- My attention span increased. My mind was not so easily distracted. I thought I would get bored, but instead I was just more mentally present for my wife and my kids and productive. ❤️- I couldn't take pictures of my kids (from my own phone). This meant I frequently borrow my wife's phone to take a picture/video of my kids doing something cute. This will be hard to overcome since I highly value those memories. That said, I lived in the moment more and was able to absorb more of my time with my kids, so there is a trade-off. 📷- When your iPhone is off, you don't get text messages from Android phones, this means I didn't get any direct texts or group texts until the week was over and I turned my phone on. Not awesome. 🤦‍♂️My conclusion:Mobile phones help us be Mobile and mobility is freedom!I am still hopeful that stand alone watches will have more of the conveniences of a phone because I felt very healthy going without a phone for a week. I will do it again.I sacrificed a some peace of mind because I always had a safety net if I was late for an early morning work meeting, but I was better at planning my day to overcome it and those that I met with appreciated it.Note: One of my college professors was ~40 and didn't have a cell phone. Period. That is the next level, not sure I'll ever go that far, but fascinating to think about the impact that would have on your life.#smartwatch#detox",0.9897,0.552388888888889,0,11,0

The listings that are seeing the most success are prime properties with good locations and either newer construction or significant updating – Buyers are looking for turn-key properties. These homes generally sell in the first 7 days on the market, and Sellers are achieving their list price and sometimes exceeding their list price due to multiple offers. Average sales prices have increased by 13.7% over this time last year. For the properties that don’t sell immediately, the average days on the market for single-family homes is 57, up from 20 days this time last year. If Sellers come on the market at a price that is perceived by the market as being too high due to updating needed, then price reductions are happening to attract Buyers. Average price reductions are in the order of 8%, so there are great opportunities for buyers willing to do some improvements to a property..https://lnkd.in/gGa68hj.Bensellscolorado.com.Follow me @benprucey.Your one-stop real estate professional!

"Andreja Mihailovic, PhD",15-03-2023,"Novi Nacrt KZ-a donosi moderne instrumente sa inkrementalnim pristupom u definisanju kaznenih raspona za razliku od dosadašnje blage i viktimoloski destimulativne kaznene politike. Zasebno inkriminisanje „Zloupotrebe tuđeg snimka, fotografije, portreta, audio zapisa ili spisa sa seksualno eksplicitnim sadržajem“ predstavlja značajan reformski iskorak jer nastoji obuhvatiti sve ranije teško zamislive oblike pornografije bez pristanka, koje se stihijski šire pod uticajem informaciono-komunikacionih tehnologija.Naime, postojeći zakonski mehanizmi nisu prepoznavali ova krivična djela u zasebnom obliku, te su do sada pravno tretirana čl. 175 Krivičnog zakonika koji se odnosi na Neovlašćeno objavljivanje i prikazivanje tuđeg spisa, portreta i snimka i čl. 251 kao krivično djelo Ucjene. Iz tog razloga nova odredba ima znatno siri domasaj jer se ne ogranicava na neovlaseceno objavljivanje, vec propisuje krivicnu odgovornost za sve vidove zloupotrebe tudjeg snimka, fotografije, audio zapisa ili spisa sa seksualno eksplicitnim sadrzajem, u sta spada i izrada novih, kao i preinacenje postojecih putem AI softverskih alata sa ciljem njihovog predstavljanjanja kao istinite.Pored toga, dodatna prednost izolovanog regulisanja je ostvarenje sveobuhvatne krivičnopravne zaštite jer sada postoji zakonska mogućnost sticaja sa krivičnim djelima iznude, budući da lica u posjedu seksualno eksplicitnih fotografija i snimaka često iznuđuje novac u zamjenu za njihovo neobjavljivanje. Imajući u vidu da su u zavisnosti od iznosa pribavljene imovinskopravne koristi kod krivičnog djela Iznude propisane zatvorske kazne idu i do 15 godina, sto takodje moze predstavljati znacajan odvracujuci faktor na potencijalne pocinioce.Kompletan tekst dostupan na portaluVijesti Online:https://lnkd.in/dAU9D7n8",0.0,0.0,0,17,0
Amy Parker Blake,15-03-2023,"Is AI the future of voice work? My husband recently had the idea to clone my voice using AI withplay.htto help me audition for more VO jobs. Two hours of my audio and a day of generating later, it *does* sound like me...but I'm not quite worried that the robots (or Siri) are coming for my job just yet.Right now, voice cloning is pretty limited. It's difficult to adjust the AI to your desired tone or inflection, and it doesn't quite have the flow of a natural read. But as the machines learn, there's no doubt it will be fine-tuned and eventually become a viable alternative to voice actors.So the question becomes - would you use AI for your voice projects? Large-scale and celebrity-based jobs will likely be safe, but the smaller and in-between gigs may slowly turn to the more affordable alternative. Which leaves a lot of voice actors and sound studios concerned about their livelihoods (myself included!). It's nice to think that people will still choose to employ a human over a robot, but it will be interesting to see if profit-hungry corporations agree.",0.949,0.4843253968253969,5 ,7,0

MAR GOMEZ,15-03-2023,"👩🏼‍🎓Hoy es el PiDay🧮Hoy es el dia del numero pi. Sí, este numero infinito que todos conocemos y que está muy presente en nuestra vida. Se celebra este dia que,además, es el cumpleaños de Albert Einstein que,casualmente, comparte fecha con Stephen Hwkings, aunque en este caso la de este ultimo es la de su fallecimiento.El numero pi es una constante y es igual a la longitud de una circunferencia entre su diámetro. No importa lo grande o pequeña que sea la circunferencia, pi siempre es el mismo y por eso es una constante. Y el numero Pi esta muy presente en nuestra vida.Por ejemplo,  podemos encontrarlo comiéndonos una pizza. No importa el tamaño de nuestra pizza (o la circunferencia que prefieras): si divides la longitud de una circunferencia por su diámetro, el valor siempre se aproximará al número π.También esta presente en nuestros smartphones ya que para interpretar la voz,Siri y Google usan la transformada de Fourier,una operación que se basa en el número pi.También en los GPS ya que casi todos los cálculos que utiliza este sistema se basan en este número.Y en la naturaleza. Los ríos tienden a evolucionar hasta tener un coeficiente de sinuosidadde 3.141592, es decir, aproximadamente el valor de Pi.El número π también se encuentra dentro de la ecuación de la dispersión de Rayleigh que nos permite explicar por qué el cielo es azul.#piday2023#matematicas",-0.5267,0.0,1 ,5,0

Swapnil Amin,15-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0

Md Khairul Islam Tamim,14-03-2023,"5 Hot Topics in Digital Marketing1. Personalization: Personalization is the practice of tailoring marketing messages and experiences to individual consumers based on their preferences, behaviors, and characteristics. With the wealth of data available through digital channels, companies can use personalization to create more relevant and engaging experiences for their customers.2. Video marketing: Video has become an increasingly important part of digital marketing strategies, as it can be used to convey messages in an engaging and memorable way. From social media videos to YouTube ads to live streaming, video can be a powerful tool for building brand awareness and driving engagement.3. Influencer marketing: Influencer marketing involves partnering with social media influencers to promote a brand or product to their followers. As social media has become more influential in shaping consumer behavior, influencer marketing has emerged as a popular way for brands to reach new audiences and build credibility with their customers.4. Voice search: With the growing popularity of voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, optimizing for voice search has become an important consideration for digital marketers. Voice search queries tend to be longer and more conversational than text-based queries, and companies need to adapt their SEO strategies to account for this shift.5. Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in digital marketing to automate tasks, improve personalization, and analyze data. From chatbots to predictive analytics, AI can help companies deliver more efficient and effective marketing experiences to their customers.#digitalmarketing#marketing#seo#brand#help#engagement#video#socialmedia#influencermarketing#artificialintelligence#google#building#consumerbehavior",0.9937,0.5287337662337662,0,2,0

Ask it for something too complex – such as a sophisticated game or business application, and it will admit its weakness and tell you that the task is currently beyond its abilities.Computers can't yet tell us, for example, what types of code or applications are needed to achieve what we are trying to do. Even if it knows this because we tell it, then ChatGPT, in particular, can’t (at the moment) attempt to create this software that specifically gives us as users a competitive edge over users of another piece of software.For example, we can't tell it to ""make me an e-commerce platform that's more effective at selling than Amazon."" If we wanted this, then we still have to spend the time and effort to first work out what makes Amazon's platform so great and then find a way of doing it better.Due to this, ChatGPT (and other current NLP-based tools) still have limited effectiveness when it comes to creating software designed to give us an edge in business or, indeed, to compete with human creativity and ingenuity.One caveat here is that although we can do our best to extrapolate what might happen in the future, in reality, no-one has a crystal ball. It’s fair to say that a lot of people who were used to AI conversing at the level of Alexa or Siri were somewhat shocked by how good ChatGPT is.Future developments could indeed increase the speed with which we are traveling towards a point in time where human programmers – or many other types of professionals – will simply not be needed. For the time being, however, we can be confident that there is still a wide range of skills required to develop software that computers don’t seem likely to be able to replicate any time soon.Source:Forbes Magzine",0.9809,0.4963169642857143,0,1,0
Awesome Future,14-03-2023,"Artificial intelligence (Siri) interrupted our conversation about consumer privacy and data protection in the metaverse withCyril Tuschi— an eerie reminder of how complex and layered these topics can be.While single new technologies can make some parts of daily life more accessible — like on-the-go messaging, watch notifications, and voice assistants — they can have an unintended impacts when they work in dynamic environments and ecosystems.While this clip fromNathan C'sAWEEU conversation with Cyril, the founder ofSyncReality, is light-hearted this interjection from a smart watch underscores how much tech is still built for best case conditions and its behavior can be unpredictable, or unintended when it is immersed in real, human environments and behaviors.Exciting times, much work yet to be done.#ai#artificialintelligence#siri#voiceassistant#dataprivacy#data#security#datasovereignty#ar#vr#xr#metaverse#augmentedreality#virtualreality#extendedreality#awe2023",0.8928,0.4752096861471862,0,1,1

Payal Rajani,14-03-2023,"Attention all e-commerce enthusiasts! The future of online shopping is upon us, and it's going to be a game-changer. Over the next five years, we can expect to see some exciting new trends and innovations in the e-commerce industry that will revolutionize the way we shop.Firstly, the rise of mobile commerce is set to continue. With more and more people using their smartphones and tablets to browse and shop online, retailers will need to focus on mobile optimization to ensure that their websites and apps are fully responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens. This means simplifying checkout processes, streamlining navigation, and optimizing content for smaller screens.Another trend we can expect to see in the near future is the integration of augmented reality into the e-commerce experience.Augmented reality (AR) allows users to visualize products in a real-world environment, enabling them to see how a product will look and feel before making a purchase. This technology has the potential to significantly increase customer satisfaction and reduce the number of returns, as shoppers will have a better understanding of what they're buying.In addition to AR, we can also expect to see the rise of voice search in e-commerce. Voice-activated assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are becoming increasingly popular, and retailers will need to optimize their product listings to be compatible with these devices. This means using natural language and long-tail keywords to ensure that their products are easily searchable via voice commands.Finally, we can expect to see continued growth in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in e-commerce. These technologies can be used to analyze customer data, predict buying patterns, and personalize the shopping experience for each individual customer. This means that retailers will be able to offer highly targeted promotions and recommendations to customers, increasing their chances of making a sale.In conclusion, the future of e-commerce is looking bright, with exciting new trends and innovations set to transform the industry over the next five years. From mobile commerce and augmented reality to voice search and artificial intelligence, retailers will need to stay ahead of the curve to succeed in this rapidly evolving landscape. So, are you ready to embrace the future of e-commerce?https://lnkd.in/dvNMUwuA#onlineshopping#technology#mobilecommerce#ai#experience",0.9958,0.5390491118077325,0,3,0

Alina L.,14-03-2023,"The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way we live, work and think. AI has opened up a world of opportunities, from improved healthcare to the development of smarter machines. But with these opportunities come potential concerns that must be addressed.The potential of AI is immense. AI-driven machines can process large volumes of data faster and more efficiently than humans, and can be used to create automated processes that can drastically improve the efficiency of businesses. AI-powered robots and drones can be used in difficult and dangerous environments, such as deep sea exploration, allowing humans to explore new frontiers. In healthcare, AI can be used to detect and diagnose diseases more quickly, aiding medical professionals in providing better care for patients.However, AI also carries certain risks. AI-driven decisions can be biased and inaccurate, as AI systems are often only as good as the data they are given. This can lead to serious civil and human rights issues, particularly when used in decision-making processes such as job selection. There is also the potential for AI to be used maliciously, with the possibility of AI-driven cyberattacks and the potential for AI to be used to manipulate public opinion and influence political outcomes.For these reasons, it is important that governments and businesses take steps to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI. Regulations should be put in place to ensure that AI-driven decisions are fair and unbiased. Companies should also ensure that their AI systems are secure and that they are held to the same standards as their human counterparts.AI is an incredible tool, but it must be used responsibly. With the right regulations in place, businesses and governments can make the most of the amazing opportunities AI provides while minimizing risks and ensuring the safety of individuals and society.#ai#cybersecurity#airegulation#datasafety",0.9966,0.5982545232545233,0,1,0
Paola Karina García De la Cruz,14-03-2023,"Entendamos un poco de la inteligencia artificial, Google la define como un conjunto de tecnologías que permiten que las computadoras realicen una variedad de funciones avanzadas, incluida la capacidad de ver, comprender y traducir lenguaje hablado y escrito, analizar datos, hacer recomendaciones, etc. Pero más allá de ser solo un concepto y de sus funciones de entendimiento como cuando Deep Blue de IBM, que venció al campeón de ajedrez Garry Kasparov en 1997 hay algunas funciones útiles donde estamos colaborando sin saberlo como la machine Learning de Google o Alexa o Siri que son un conjunto de generadores de lenguajes naturales, procesamiento y machine learning.Como ves no estamos nada lejos de coexistir diariamente con la IA y lo que me pone un poco ansiosa es imaginar el potencial que tendremos al trabajar con ella en pro de mejorar proyectos y procesos de nuestras actividades diarias, por ejemplo, como mercadóloga digamos que tengo una duda como ¿qué segmento de mercado  compró más ropa en línea durante el 2022? o ¿que porcentaje de norteamericanos vieron el Súper Bowl en 2021?, las respuestas de estas preguntas las obtienes fácilmente con Chat GPT o digamos que ocupas fotografiar a una modelo en un anuncio publicitario, podrías generarlo con IA en MidJourney, evitando castings, contratos, catering, etc. (aún tiene problemas replicando las manos, pero funciona), permitir a la IA colaborar con nosotros definitivamente nos haría la vida más fácil.¿Tú crees que debemos temerle o darle la bienvenida? ¿O tal vez estamos inevitablemente corriendo hacia la 3ra guerra mundial, máquinas vs humanos?Dime qué piensas?!#google#inteligenciaartificialEvolución de la humanidad, video creado por una IA",-0.7936,0.5,0,0,0
Youssef EL Hejjioui,14-03-2023,"I asked Chat GPT to generate an explanation of AI for a 10-year-old boy, and this is how it responded :Hey kiddo, have you ever heard of Artificial Intelligence or AI for short? It's like having a robot brain that can think and make decisions, just like a human brain. But instead of being inside a person's head, it's inside a computer or a robot.AI is really good at doing things that require a lot of thinking, like recognizing faces or voices, playing games, or helping us find information on the internet. It learns and gets better at these things over time, just like how we get better at something the more we practice it.Think about when you play a video game and the computer characters seem to be playing against you. That's AI at work! Or when you talk to a virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa and they can answer your questions, that's AI too.But just like how we need to learn and practice to get better at something, AI needs to be taught and trained by humans. Scientists and engineers work hard to make AI better and smarter, so it can help us do more amazing things in the future.So, in short, AI is like a robot brain that can do cool things and help us out.

Ivona Misimovic,14-03-2023,"Što kada je sve važno, a to ""sve"" ne stane u naš raspored?Nikada nije dovoljno vremena za sve ideje, želje ilipotrebe koje imamo. Ako se i ti osjećaš kao da je sve s tvoje to-do liste prioritet, vrijeme je za preispitivanje kriterija prema kojima ocjenjuješ svoje prioritete.Preformuliraš li samo jedno pitanje, možeš dobiti jasniju sliku i donijeti bolju odluku u organizaciji svog vremena.Ako se i ti poput moje klijentice nađeš u situaciji da je 90% stvari s tvoje liste projekata/ tjednih zadataka prioritet, vrlo je vjerojatno da sebi postavljaš pogrešno pitanje prilikom dodjeljivanja oznake ""prioritet 1-5"".Pitanje koje više zbunjuje nego pomaže jest: Da li je ovo važno?U ovom slučaju će na 90% tvojih projekata/ obaveza odgovor biti DA (jer inače se valjda ne bi prvotno ni našli na tvojoj listi).Zamka u ovom pitanju je u tome što je previše generalno i vodi te na misao o generalnim željama/ potrebama a ne stvarnim prioritetima ovog trenutka.⭐ Evo konkretnog primjera:Da li je važno otići na konferenciju i biti u tijeku s novitetima na tržištu, možda pronaći novi proizvod/ projekt? Odgovor: Da, prioritet od 1-5 je u ovom slučaju 4. Tko ne želi biti informiran i inovativan :-)A ako bismo pitali: Koliko je važno u ovom trenutku za nas (ovaj konkretan mjesec/kvartal) za nas uvrstiti novi proizvod u asortiman/ pokrenuti novi projekt (čak i ako ga nađeš dolaskom na tu konferenciju)? Odgovor je: Pa i nije toliko važno, a na ljestvici 1-5, odlazak na tu konferenciju (u odnosu na ostale aktivnosti, zadane ciljeve i utjecaj na rezultat), jest zapravo prioritet razine 2.GENERALNO jeste važno biti u tijeku s novitetima, ali promatramo li kontekst trenutka i trenutnih resursa ( i ostale projekte koji imaju možda i veći potencijal i utjecaj na širi cilj/ rezultat), to TRENUTNO ima vrlo mali prioritet. To ne znači da nećemo nikada ići na konferencije 😊 Tim pitanjem ćemo se baviti u ranijim fazama, pri postavljanju šire slike naših cijljeva i planova aktivnosti za njihovo dostizanje.U trenucima kada nam raspored puca pod pritiskom prevelike količine obaveza, sigurno je da će ovakva odluka i kriterij što NIJE trenutno visok prioritet pomoći i osloboditi raspored da se one aktivnosti koje su u njemu ostale, odrade s maksimumom posvećenosti i kvalitete.#executivecoaching#timemanagement#consulting#levelup#leadershipdevelopment#leadership",0.0,1.0,2 ,17,0

Steve Mautone,14-03-2023,"Rumors about Apple’s headset have been discussed for over a decade. Since Sergey Brin parachuted out of an airplane at Google I/O: “When will Apple launch a Google Glass competitor?”At the time, smartglasses were little more than a direct smartwatch competitor. And we’ve seen the Apple Watch take over the wearable market in the years that followed. But Augmented Reality glasses provide another level of interaction beyond watches. With a stronger processor and Spatial Computing, AR glasses can make navigation extremely intuitive. They can enable incredible games like Niantic Labs’ Ingress and Pokémon Go and Magic Leap’s Dr. Grordbort’s Invaders. But what will truly change computing is when we all see how Augmented Reality can revolutionize the way we visualize data. Apps like Miro, Apple Freeform, MindNode (Mindmapping) will leap to a whole new level. Instead of staring at a screen, pinching and zooming to get the best view, users will be transported *into* the data, like Tony Stark trying to invent a new element or discover time travel.But more than the display, Apple is set to release a huge upgrade to Siri that’s on par with (or possibly far beyond) the recent trending AI: ChatGPT. Having a headset with Augmented Reality as well as an advanced voice-based AI will change the way we all work.The form factor being a large, ski goggle headset or a sleek pair of RayBans isn’t as important; the hardware will improve and shrink over time. Spatial Computing will truly change the world; AR + AI will be as dramatic of a change to computing as the iPhone was so many years ago.https://lnkd.in/eUUMRT_s#augmentedreality#ai#computing",0.9919,0.6143831168831169,0,4,0

David J. Wilson,14-03-2023,"Good morning! Are you interested in learning more about 2023’s most talked-about technology? 🧐Yes, I'm talking about the exciting world of generative AI, and its potential to transform industries and create new forms of content. Look at my first comment a link to this complete article byMcKinsey & Company, which explains the basics of#generativeaiand its many practical applications.Let me highlight here some key points:➡ Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulation, and even videos. In the category of machine learning, it generates all kinds of new content, such as articles where the grammar is perfect, the tone works, and the narrative flows, or music and art that really make sense.➡#chatgpt—the GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer—it’s a free chatbot that can generate an answer to almost any question it’s asked. And DALL-E is a tool for AI-generated art. ChatGPT is being developed by a team of researchers and engineers at OpenAI, a research organization dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence in a safe and beneficial manner, ChatGPT was first announced and made available to developers in June 2020, and then released for testing to the public on November 30, 2022. As you can see in the image byInsider Intelligence, over a million people signed up to use it in just five days, a new record for user acquisition (Source:Data.ai). Computer code, essays, poems, and even jokes, are examples of what fans have posted while interacting with this chatbot (me included).➡ AI is the practice of getting machines to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks. For instance, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are based on AI technology. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence. Through ML, practitioners develop AI through models that can “learn” from data patterns without human direction. The huge volume and complexity of data have increased the potential for machine learning, as well as the need for it.➡ Machine learning is founded on several building blocks, as our way of transforming your business model atCeibo Digital, starting with classical statistical techniques developed between the 18th and 20th centuries for small data sets. In the 1930s and 1940s, computer pioneers such as Alan Turing began working on the basic techniques for machine learning. Does anyone remember the Turing Machine?➡ Until recently, machine learning was largely limited to predictive models, used to observe, and classify patterns in content. Generative AI was a breakthrough. Instead of perceiving and classifying a photo, machine learning is now able to create an image or text description on its own.Generative AI has the power to transform the way we live and work, and ChatGPT is just one example of the incredible possibilities it offers.

Gaston Algaze,14-03-2023,"During the last couple of months I’ve been trying out ChatGPT, making sure to do it in a way that would go beyond the novelty, trying to address real life challenges.This is what I found.1. It’s relatively easy to use, I can see it embedded in almost every aspect of our daily life. Imagine a smarter Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant.While not entirely smooth yet, it will solve most of the hurdles of modern life. All simple questions will be answered, not googled, answered right here right now.2. There’s a chance people will become more stupid, by relying on AI as people rely today on a GPS to drive everywhere. Experience will still matter, but if we remove people from building such experience, then we’re really putting our own evolution into the AI’s hands.3. Will my job be impacted by this technology? 100% Yes. Will I lose my job? Look if you’re questioning yourself today whether you’re going to lose your job or not, then you probably will. The question is not whether you’ll lose it or not, the question is how you can take this new tool and apply it to make it your own.4. I’m pretty sure this will accelerate the lifecycle of many technologies, products and even cultures. We’re looking at the next real evolutionary stage. And something people don't realize, is that this started not with ChatGPT but many years ago with thousands of other models. AI is coming to stay and we will need to adapt.So now you know what I think the next few years will bring. What's fascinating is that we brought ChatGPT to life by programming it to mirror our own thoughts and expressions. We're now entering a new era where humans won't be the only ones creating things that are uniquely human. There's a growing similarity between the products of human creativity and those of AI. We're even starting to adopt some machine-like characteristics, which makes it easier for robots to learn from us. It's exciting to imagine how humans and robots will work in tandem to achieve incredible feats in the future.So, how do you think AI will impact your world? I'd really like to hear your thoughts...#technology#ai#experience#people#work",0.9835,0.49001222542889206,0,23,0
Jasmine Moore,14-03-2023,"🖐🏾Hi Jazzy Engineers and AI Enthusiast,📎Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a buzzword in recent years, with applications ranging from self-driving cars to personal assistants like Siri and Alexa and now chatGPT. However, the accuracy of AI has been the subject of much debate and controversy, particularly when it comes to using it for critical applications such as medical diagnosis or financial predictions. I've asked chatGPT to assist me in shedding some light on how AI learns and how its accuracy can be improved through the process of deep learning.ChatGPT says, 🤖""Hey there, Jazzy engineers! Are you wondering how I, an AI language model, learns? It's all thanks to a process called deep learning, which is a fancy way of saying I can learn from large amounts of data by building complex mathematical models.Let me break it down for you. First, I'm fed input data that's preprocessed and transformed into a numerical representation. Then, I'm trained using an algorithm that adjusts the parameters of the mathematical model to minimize the difference between my predictions and the true output values.During training, I learn from my mistakes through a process called backpropagation. It's kind of like how you learn from your mistakes and adjust your approach. Once I'm trained, I can make predictions on new data that I haven't seen before. This is called inference.So, the next time you ask me a question or give me some input, know that I'm using my deep learning abilities to process it and give you the best response I can.""⚜Many of us imagine AI the way its depicted in movies, causing a lot of confusion and misunderstanding about how useful AI can be and how ""intelligent"" the technology actually is.

Ondrej Polak,14-03-2023,"How to Build a 💪 Strong Foundation for 🏭 Manufacturing Digital Transformation: The 8 Essential Pillars of SIRI.In my previous post, I discussed the three fundamental building blocks of manufacturing digital transformation, as outlined by The Smart Industry Readiness Index (SIRI): 💻technology, 🛠process, and 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦organization. However, when we delve deeper, we find that there are eight key pillars underneath the three fundamental building blocks.🔶These pillars are vertical integration, horizontal integration, integrated product life cycle, automation, connectivity, intelligence, talent readiness, and structure & management. Although not all pillars will be equally important to every organization, they should all be 👨‍💻evaluated and considered when assessing current state.🔶The eight pillars of SIRI were chosen based on a comprehensive assessment of Industry 4.0 practices across various manufacturing industries. The pillars were selected based on their ability to enable effective digital transformation and deliver significant value to the organization.🔶Connectivity is a critical pillar in#Industry4and serves as a prerequisite for the effective use of the intelligence, automation and as well as vertical and horizontal integration pillars. In a manufacturing context, this could mean connecting machines and devices to a central systems like MES or ERP to 🔍monitor their performance and identify potential issues before they escalate into larger problems. With the connectivity pillar in place, the intelligence pillar can be leveraged to analyze data and provide 💡insights into machine performance, enabling predictive maintenance, process control and other proactive measures.🔶Another example of interconnectivity between pillars is the integration of product lifecycle management with vertical and horizontal integration. By leveraging these three pillars, organizations can create a more streamlined and 📈 efficient manufacturing process from product design to delivery.🔶Without comprehensive evaluation framework there is a ⛈risk as companies may focus on areas they are already familiar with or already good at. For instance, a supply chain management team may focus on initiatives that increase efficiency in areas such as sourcing, procurement or 🚛logistics as these initiatives are important to them. Knowing where such initiatives fit and how much they help to enable realization of overall business strategy is crucial. Therefore, SIRI serves as a 🧾checklist to help companies broaden their transformation efforts and formally evaluating all essential pillars of Industry4.0.Follow#SIRIUKto learn how SIRI is supporting the manufacturing sector in the UK#ukmfg#smartfactory#industry40#leadershipmatters#digitaltransformation#digitaladoption#innovation#smartmanufacturing#strategyexecution#manufacturing",0.9955,0.5181361607142857,2 ,21,2

Facundo Lanzilotti,14-03-2023,"¡Hola a todos! ¿Alguna vez han oído hablar de la IA? Seguro que sí, pero ¿saben todas las ventajas que ofrece?La IA o inteligencia artificial es una tecnología cada vez más presente en nuestra vida diaria. Desde asistentes virtuales como Siri o Alexa, hasta algoritmos de recomendación en plataformas de streaming o redes sociales, la IA está presente en muchas cosas que hacemos.¿Y qué ventajas tiene? Pues varias. Por ejemplo, gracias a la IA podemos tener respuestas más rápidas y precisas a nuestras preguntas. Los asistentes virtuales pueden responder a nuestras dudas en cuestión de segundos, sin tener que buscar en internet o en libros. Además, la IA puede ayudarnos a ahorrar tiempo y esfuerzo en tareas repetitivas o monótonas. Por ejemplo, en la industria manufacturera, la IA puede realizar tareas de control de calidad o de ensamblaje de forma mucho más eficiente que los humanos.Otra ventaja importante de la IA es su capacidad para procesar grandes cantidades de datos. Esto es especialmente útil en campos como la medicina, donde la IA puede analizar grandes cantidades de información médica para ayudar a diagnosticar enfermedades o encontrar tratamientos más eficaces.Y por último, pero no menos importante, la IA puede ayudarnos a tomar mejores decisiones. Al analizar datos y patrones, la IA puede ayudarnos a identificar oportunidades o riesgos que de otra forma podríamos haber pasado por alto.En resumen, la IA ofrece muchas ventajas que pueden mejorar nuestra vida diaria. Desde respuestas rápidas y precisas, hasta la capacidad de procesar grandes cantidades de datos y ayudarnos a tomar mejores decisiones, la IA tiene el potencial de transformar muchos aspectos de nuestra vida. Así que la próxima vez que utilicen un asistente virtual o vean una recomendación en una plataforma de streaming, recuerden que todo eso es posible gracias a la IA.",-0.7672,1.0,0,13,3

Digital Hitmen,14-03-2023,"As the name suggests, voice search is a method of entering search queries on a device such as a computer, smartphone, wearable device, or smart at-home assistant.⁠⁠The device relies on voice recognition technology and ever-evolving AI. Various tech giants have their search assistants.⁠⁠For example, Apple products feature Siri, Amazon has Alexa, and the phrase “Hey, Google” activates Google’s voice search. Using voice search while multitasking is a very typical behaviour. In these cases, speaking queries to a device enhances safety, particularly if the user is driving or otherwise occupied.⁠⁠For years, experts predicted that search by voice would be the future of online. However, the future is now, and it is changing how consumers search online. As a result, businesses must learn and embrace voice search optimisation to stay competitive in the audio search world.",0.8957,0.4108843537414966,0,1,0

I was very pleased that our company allows and thinks about the development of its employees.Knowing who I am, what my strengths and weaknesses are and most importantly what motivates me and respecting other people is essential in a large company. It is good to at least on that one day write it down on paper, take tests and answer everything honestly. Get to know yourself.I found out that money is not the main motivation for me, and certainly not a certainty (probably a remnant of my experience in the USA, where I almost ended up on the street and still believed that I could make a living with 10 dollars in my pocket :) ), on the contrary, I am motivated by the meaning of work, the impact on the running of the company and the management of people, followed by the possibility of creativity.But most of all you have to know that others don't have it like that. So don't be an asshole. Ugh, this is going to be hard...Otherwise, on development and philosophy, I discovered an amazing podcast about Tomas Bata fromNadace Tomáše Bati.

Mariusz Korba,14-03-2023,"Voice Recognition has slipped under your radar!While everyone is talking about ChatGPT, the voice recognition model Whisper (also by OpenAI) might have been underestimated.We all know Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. But equally, I think many, myself included, are underwhelmed by their accuracy, pushing us back to speak to them with somewhat robotic commands or moving back to typing.At the same time, many people who tried to use ChatGPT found it somewhat inaccurate. Still, I can bet that at least some of that inaccuracy is because they didn't write enough contextual information for the AI to understand the question entirely.I think that with accurate voice recognition, the potential us having a meaningful and precise conversation is much more impressive.With accurate speech ➡️ text will come accurate text ➡️ speech. Take Eleven Labs - their model can understand the context of a text, and with proper voice recognition, it can speak back to you with the tone you'd expect based on the context of that text.So, using Whisper to transcribe our question, GPT to form an accurate and comprehensive response, and the Event Labs to convincingly speak back to us could take our conversations with technology to another level. This would make them more human-like, accurate, and finally useful. Sure, these tools still make some mistakes, but they'll become more capable and helpful with time, and we can already see this.In a business environment, you can imagine meetings/calls where AI automatically takes notes and minutes, extracting key facts, actions, new ideas and who started them. Such notes can then be summarised and even written with the preferred level of detail based on each stakeholder's seniority, needs, knowledge, and interests. Each person can then listen to such a summary at their leisure, making it easier and quicker to digest, like listening to an audiobook vs reading a book - all automatic 🤖.In fact, with OpenAI recently releasing APIs, you don't need to imagine this. Instead, you can implement such a workflow now!Naturally, there will be many more helpful use cases, but, like with any new technology, privacy concerns will be, and should be, raised as well.#ai#artificialintelligence#future",0.9897,0.4580457351290685,0,5,0

Das zeigt, wie wichtig es ist, die Vorteile der Kreislaufwirtschaft zu nutzen und den Wert von Materialien zu maximieren.Dieser Umhang bietet nicht nur eine nachhaltige Alternative zu herkömmlichen Friseurumhängen, sondern ist auch besonders komfortabel und funktional. Der fließende Stoff leitet Haare ab und der Schneideumhang ist atmungsaktiv – perfekt für den Einsatz im Salon.Wie bereits erwähnt, wird Nachhaltigkeit in der heutigen Zeit immer wichtiger und das betrifft nicht nur Unternehmen, sondern auch die Mitarbeiter.

Wittingly Ventures,15-03-2023,"What is this new PM specialization called ""AI Product Management?!"" How do you hire for it, grow your team into it, or become one?I loved working with my co-author Polly M. Allen who is the founder for AICareerboost and was Principal AI Product Manager on Alexa to write this article. If you don't have time for the full article, here's the cheat sheet summary (and no, not ChatGPT was NOT involved):ARTICLE TAKEAWAYS- AI Product Management is a new area of specialization of Product Management, similar to specializations like ‘Growth PM’ or ‘GTM PM’ in its reliance on specialized skills, that relates to developing and managing products that leverage AI.- AI Product Managers require traditional core product management skills - being able to identify the right problem, and being able to deliver the right solution - with additional depth in software engineering, data-centric skills, communication and risk management.- Hiring and development of AI Product talent depends on the stage of your project. For discovery-stage initiatives, emphasize user knowledge and domain expertise. For optimizing and scaling, look for technical depth and data-driven decision-making.- Develop technical knowledge in domain-expert PMs by pairing them with AI technologists during planning. Develop user empathy in more technical PMs with data analysis of usage patterns, and pairing them with user research teams.- Many AI initiatives have been technology led, leading to a bias to hiring AI technologists as PMs rather than upskilling domain experts or optimization-focused PMs in AI. Organizations need to invest in developing AI knowledge in their product teams to fully take advantage of the latest innovations in AI.hashtag#productmanagement#ai",0.7924,0.4956574675324675,0,0,0

That's why it's crucial to have a realistic mindset and approach from the get-go.I've seen too many working relationships crumble due to unrealistic expectations, such as hiring the cheapest assistant, expecting instant results without training, or thinking you don't have enough work for them.The harsh truth is that the trial period may not be smooth sailing at first, but that's okay! Take the time to invest in building a strong foundation and communication with your assistant. Be patient, provide clear feedback, and work together to find the best ways to support each other. And bosses, remember that being involved in your assistant's onboarding process is crucial for their success.In the end, if you want a great assistant, you must be a great leader.

"David Bohmiller, MBA, MS",15-03-2023,"Early in my career, I remember a VP of Operations visiting one of our fitness facilities. Over 20 years later, I still think about the example he set.1) He helped clean the clubYes, there was a cleaning schedule. But, he wasn't above grabbing a vacuum or wiping down machines. It wasn't so he could say, ""look what's not getting done."" It was to improve the customer experience and to help his team members.2) He spent time with each employeeWithout interrupting the customer or client experience, he made sure to approach every employee, to introduce himself to new employees, or to reconnect with those of greater tenure. He knew our names, recent contributions & achievements, took time to understand our goals, to offer advice, and ask for our feedback. He wasn't just approachable - he made the approach.3) He spent time with membersSpend enough time somewhere and it's easy to take for granted what customers look for and experience. Visit a club once a quarter (or less) and you need a few more eyes to help. Understanding what the members saw, heard, felt, and experienced was critical. Rather than reading about it in a suggestion box or online form, he went to the source with authentic care and curiosity.Management isn't easy. Leadership is even tougher. But, small habits, exercised consistently, can influence organizational culture. And, they can influence individual employees - enough so that the lessons remain intact decades later.",0.9856,0.4044483294483295,6 ,18,1

Aquí algunos de los motivos por los que Google Search está en declive:🔍 Los resultados de búsqueda han empeorado por un SEO agresivo que en muchos casos llevan al usuario a resultados poco útiles.📊 Resultados de web de afiliados o publicidad donde la información es escasa y la pantalla está llena de sitios donde clicar.🔮 Resultados personalizados para los usuarios que crean una burbuja donde cada uno recibe la información que refuerza sus opiniones y creencias previas, lo que limita el acceso a la diversidad de información.❓ Google intenta adivinar lo que realmente quiere decir el usuario, en lugar de mostrar resultados para las palabras exactas que el usuario busca.🔄 Los cambios en los algoritmos de búsqueda muchas veces producen que sitios relevantes y con información de calidad desaparezcan de la primera página.🤖 Con el aumento de la desinformación y el contenido generado por IA, cada vez es más difícil para Google distinguir entre contenido auténtico y de calidad y contenido falso o de baja calidad.📱 Muchos usuarios utilizan redes sociales o aplicaciones especializadas para hacer las búsquedas (como Tik Tok o Amazon).🔒 Muchos usuarios preocupados por la privacidad utilizan otros buscadores o ad-blockers y bloqueo de rastreadores.🎤 Cada vez más se utilizan los asistentes de voz para hacer búsquedas (Alexa, Siri...)¿Añadirías algún motivo más? Y más importante, ¿sabiendo todo esto invertirías en Google Ads?

Niharika Haridas,15-03-2023,"""We probably don't need ML to predict if a ball will roll in front of a car""1.1It's Day 1 atJohns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineeringas part of the HEEP(Hopkins Engineering Exploratory Program) and I had the pleasure to attend an insightful session byTony Dahburaon ""Promise and Perils of AI"". I would love to express my gratitude to him as well for such a wonderful session.He talked about the enormous potential of the autonomous world to make or break the modern era. The prime focus of the session was on a part of AI that we sometimes shy away from talking about, which is ""What Can Possibly Go Wrong?""AI is largely statistical, and its reliability can sometimes be questionable. He elaborated on the common pitfalls of ML modeling, including how crucial it is to obtain the right training data and how over-generalization of models can be bad.ML systems are happy to be biased if it means producing good results. It's astonishing to see how Algorithmic bias and Societal bias can show up in ML models. These biases in autonomous systems can be catastrophic and it is critical that we are careful with the handling of systems like these.The human-machine interaction is growing exponentially, and it's high time we look at the other side of the coin, which is AI .Tony Dahburaposed an intriguing question: ""If humans should have the right to know when they are interacting with a machine.

Ahmadreza Sazegarnejad,15-03-2023,"There is a lot to discuss about ethical AI, this is a simple one:From the text:“When you text your friend a joke and they reply with three tears-of-joy emojis, your body responds with endorphins and oxytocin as you revel in the knowledge that your friend is amused.Our instinctive reaction to AI-generated emojis is likely to be the same, even though there is no human emotion at the other end. We can be deceived into responding to, and feeling empathy for, an inanimate object.”And also:“My worry is that, without appropriate safeguards, such technology could undermine people’s autonomy. AIs that ‘emote’ could induce us to make harmful mistakes by harnessing the power of our empathic responses. The dangers are already apparent. When one ten-year-old asked Amazon’s Alexa for a challenge, it told her to touch a penny to a live electrical outlet. Luckily, the girl didn’t follow Alexa’s advice, but a generative AI could be much more persuasive. Less dramatically, an AI could shame you into buying an expensive product you don’t want. You might think that would never happen to you, but a 2021 study found that people consistently underestimated how susceptible they were to misinformation.”",-0.7444,0.4504761904761905,0,5,0

Abdullahi Abdulbasid,15-03-2023,"""Natural Language Processing: The Future of Communication"":Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP is enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, thus making communication between humans and machines more seamless.NLP has many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and voice-activated systems such as Siri and Alexa. These systems use NLP to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner. NLP can also be used to analyze large amounts of textual data, such as social media posts, emails, and customer reviews.One of the key challenges in NLP is understanding the nuances of human language, such as idioms, sarcasm, and context. NLP systems must be able to understand the meaning behind words and phrases, and interpret them correctly. This requires the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, to process and analyze large amounts of data.Another important aspect of NLP is natural language generation, which involves using AI to generate human-like language. This technology can be used in various applications, such as writing news articles, creating chatbot responses, and generating personalized emails.NLP is also being used in healthcare to analyze medical records and patient data to improve diagnosis and treatment. NLP systems can analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to humans. This can help healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans.Overall, NLP has the potential to transform the way we communicate with machines and each other. As NLP technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see more widespread adoption of chatbots, virtual assistants, and other NLP applications in our daily lives. NLP is poised to revolutionize many industries, including healthcare, customer service, and marketing.In conclusion, NLP is a rapidly growing field that is revolutionizing the way we communicate with machines. As NLP technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more advanced and sophisticated applications of this technology in various industries. NLP has the potential to make communication more seamless, efficient, and personalized, thereby improving our overall quality of life.#machinelearning#data#ai#healthcare#artificialintelligence#medical",0.9877,0.4965045592705168,0,0,0

Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt.

Un dossier doit être suivi jusqu’au bout et ne pas s’arrêter à l’ordre de service.Ne te lasse pas de relancer les entreprises tous les jours, ça fait partie du job (perso je fais ça le matin à l’ouverture, c’est mon créneau relance).Quand tu consultes le conseil syndical, ne leur demande pas l’autorisation, dis-leur plutôt « sauf avis contraire de votre part, je passe commande » (tu vas gagner un temps considérable).Ton interlocuteur privilégié c’est le Président du conseil syndical, et lui gère son CS (tu vas gagner du temps aussi).Organise ton planning d’AG longtemps à l’avance, et n’oublie pas que c’est le syndic qui choisit la date et l’heure (montre un peu de souplesse mais reste ferme).Choisis-toi un bon plombier, un bon architecte et un bon avocat.N’aie pas peur de dire non aux copropriétaires (ton seul aiguillon est l’intérêt collectif du Syndicat des copropriétaires, la loi et le Règlement de copropriété).Apprend par cœur la loi de 65 et le décret de 67. Le code de la copropriété est ton livre de chevet.Prend ton téléphone pour parler dès que le mail devient du tchat (les mails sont un fléau, souviens-toi que leur fonction initiale est d’envoyer des documents et des informations, pas à tchater).Va vers les gens et au-devant des problèmes avant qu’ils ne s’imposent à toi et finissent par t’envahir.N’hésite pas à poser plein de questions à tes collègues et aux autres professionnels, sur les chantiers ou dans les procédures, chacun son métier, on en apprend tous les jours dans ce merveilleux métier.Prends du recul et ne prends surtout pas les attaques à titre personnel, tout cela n’est qu’un grand théâtre.Recadre les copropriétaires qui parlent mal, ils ont besoin de ça.

Nazmul Hassan,15-03-2023,"Search engine optimization (SEO) is constantly evolving as search engines like Google refine their algorithms and new technologies emerge. Here are some possible trends that could shape the future of SEO:Focus on user intent: As search engines become more sophisticated, they are better able to understand the intent behind a user's search query. This means that optimizing for keywords alone is no longer enough. Instead, SEO will increasingly be about understanding what users are looking for and providing them with relevant content and experiences.Importance of voice search: With the rise of smart speakers and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, voice search is becoming more prevalent. SEO strategies will need to adapt to the unique challenges and opportunities of voice search, such as optimizing for natural language queries and local search.Emphasis on mobile-first indexing: More and more people are accessing the internet on their mobile devices, which has led to Google shifting towards mobile-first indexing. This means that websites that are not optimized for mobile devices may suffer in search rankings. SEO will need to prioritize mobile optimization to ensure visibility in search results.Integration with other channels: SEO is increasingly being integrated with other marketing channels, such as social media, email marketing, and content marketing. A holistic approach that considers how SEO fits into the larger marketing picture will be important.Overall, the future of SEO will likely continue to be shaped by advancements in technology and changes in user behavior. SEO professionals will need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and adapt their strategies accordingly to remain effective.#searchengines#seo#marketing#searchengineoptimization#contentmarketing#technology",0.9726,0.5490143784786643,0,0,0

Der#APIZugang ist leider noch nicht voll möglich, wird aber in den nächsten Tagen folgen.Was ist anders? Die Qualität hat sich deutlich gesteigert, höherer „Faktengenauigkeit“, die Textausgaben sind menschlicher und nicht so gleichmäßig wie vorher. Wobei ihr das auch per Eingabeaufforderung selber steuern könnt.Ich kann also auch einen Text für einen Viertklässler, in Reimform oder mit bestimmten Buchstaben- / Satzkonstruktionen umschreiben lassen. Auch eine Ausgabe in sehr einfacher Sprache ist möglich.Was sehr spannend ist: ich kann verschiedene Medien als Input nutzen. Ein Beispiel: Ich nutze ein Foto von allen Lebensmitteln die ich habe, und frage was ich damit für Gerichte kochen kann. Ich bekomme so eine Liste mit Gerichten und kann mir daraus dann ein Rezept aussuchen.Ich kann ebenfalls eine Toneingabe nutzen, bekomme als quasi einen (halben) Voicebot wie Alexa direkt mitgeliefert.Noch interessanter: Stimmungen von Menschen können eingefangen werden, wenn ihr Fotos als Eingabe verwendet.Wenn ich also weiß, dass jemand gerade wütend oder traurig ist, kann ich ihm einen Inhalt anders zur Verfügung stellen, als wenn er glücklich oder positiv aufgeregt ist.Aber was hat das alles mit#sparkassezu tun?Wir wollen eine völlig neue Art des Kundendialogs schaffen, der nur mit dem Einsatz von#KImöglich ist, und uns ermöglicht unsere 40.000.000 Kunden sehr emotionalisiert anzusprechen.

There are many organizational problems that won't be solved even by the most fantastically awesome learning professionals.Training can only solve problems that stem from a lack of knowledge or skills.Many stakeholders, however, assume that the problem IS a lack of knowledge or skill when actually, it is not. They don't have the time to do the analysis and/or they are too close to the situation.That means, if we are going to make the most of company time and resources, we must do the analysis before blindly saying yes to a request, as much as possible. If training won't solve the problem, we owe it to the organization to suggest alternatives.Here are six problems that training cannot solve.Click into the full article to read about real life examples of each from my own experiences.Problems training cannot solve:1). A manager who won't give feedback or provide coaching2). Misaligned or unclear expectations3). Misaligned reward systems4). Clunky technology, workflow, and/or processes5).

RiseUpp,15-03-2023,"EVERYTHING YOU DO NOW, AI WILL DO FOR YOUArtificial Intelligence (AI) has come a long way since its inception and has now become an integral part of our daily lives. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI has impacted various industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail, among others. As AI continues to evolve, it's becoming more apparent that it has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more.Let's take a closer look at some of the jobs that AI can do, both simple and advanced:Simple Jobs:👉 Data Entry: AI algorithms can be programmed to recognize and input data from various sources, including forms, surveys, and spreadsheets.👉 Customer Service: Chatbots and virtual assistants can handle basic customer inquiries and support tasks.👉 Social Media Management: AI can analyze social media trends, create posts, and even respond to comments and messages.👉 Personal Shopping: AI can analyze shopping behaviour and preferences to make personalized recommendations for users.👉 Traffic Control: AI can help manage traffic patterns by monitoring traffic flow and suggesting alternative routes in real-time.Advanced Jobs:👉 Medical Diagnosis: AI can analyze medical images and data to help doctors diagnose diseases and conditions.👉 Legal Research: AI algorithms can analyze legal documents and cases to assist lawyers with research and case preparation.👉 Financial Analysis: AI can analyze financial data to help investors make informed decisions.👉 Creative Writing: AI can generate creative writing, including articles, poetry, and even entire novels.👉 Robotics: AI-powered robots can perform complex tasks, including assembling products and performing surgical procedures.While AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve our lives, there are also concerns about its impact on the job market. As AI becomes more advanced, it's likely to take over many jobs that were traditionally performed by humans. However, it's important to note that AI is not here to replace humans, but rather to assist and augment human capabilities.To prepare for the future of work, it's essential to embrace the potential of AI and focus on developing skills that complement what AI can do. This includes developing critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence, which are all skills that AI cannot replicate.In conclusion, AI has the potential to do everything that humans can do and more. While this may be concerning to some, it's important to remember that AI is here to assist and augment human capabilities. To prepare for the future of work, it's important to embrace AI and focus on developing skills that complement what AI can do, ultimately leading to a more productive and efficient workforce.#FutureOfWork#ArtificialIntelligence#Automation#Upskilling#Reskilling#Adaptability#Innovation#DigitalTransformation#JobMarket",0.9873,0.4997835497835498,0,2,0

Điều này là chỉ là sự ngẫu nhiên hay có một lí do nào đó phía sau?Mặc dù hầu hết các trợ lý ảo đều có thể được cài đặt tuỳ chỉnh sao cho phù hợp với yêu cầu của người sử dụng nhưng mặc định trợ lý ảo trên các thiết bị sẽ là giọng nữ. Điều này đơn giản là vì con người ta có xu hướng ưa chuộng giọng nữ giới nói hơn, một nghiên cứu khoa học đã chỉ ra rằng giọng nữ giới tạo cảm giác mềm mại, dịu dàng. Hơn nữa vì chúng ta được tiếp xúc với giọng của nữ giới ngay từ khi còn ở trong bụng mẹ nên sẽ cảm thấy gần gũi, thân quen hơn.Một nghiên cứu khác cũng chỉ ra rằng phụ nữ có thể phát âm những nguyên âm rõ ràng hơn nam giới, qua đó góp phần truyền tải chính xác thông tin giúp cho giọng nữ trở nên dễ nghe hơn. Những lý do trên đã khiến cho giọng nói nữ giới trở thành sự lựa chọn hàng đầu để áp dụng cho các trợ lý ảo.Với Trợ lý ảo VinFast được phát triển bởi VinBigData, người dùng có thể giao tiếp tự nhiên thông qua 4 giọng tiêu chuẩn (nam/nữ miền Bắc và nam/nữ miền Nam) là các MC/BTV nổi tiếng của VTV. Tuy nhiên, giọng nói mặc định trong lần đầu “làm quen” cùng xe được lựa chọn là giọng đọc của BTV Hoài Anh - một trong những nữ MC “quốc dân” của Việt Nam.Còn các bạn thấy sao? Giọng nam hay nữ sẽ “nịnh tai” các bạn hơn?

Is this just a coincidence or is there a reason behind it?Although most virtual assistants can be customized to suit the user's wants, the default selection will mostly be female. This is simply because humans prefer female voices, a scientific study has shown that female voices create a soft, gentle feeling. Moreover, we are exposed to female voices from the early stages of our lives hence we will feel closer and more familiar.Another study also showed that women can articulate vowels more clearly than men which makes female voices easier to hear. Therefore, female voices tend to be the first choice for virtual assistants.With VinFast Virtual Assistant developed by VinBigData, users can communicate naturally via 4 standard voices (Northern male/female and Southern male/female) which belong to renowned MCs of VTV. Especially, the default voice on Vinfast cars was dubbed by Hoai Anh - one of the ""national"" female MCs of Vietnam.Which voice is more like “the music to your ears”?

The membranes shown are semicrystalline (15-20 vol% crystalline PVA) and exhibit ultimate tensile strengths of 20 MPa and elastic moduli of 150 MPa. But what is truly unusual is that these samples were made 51 years ago (in March 1972) and have been kept in DI water with formalin (changed often) since then.Thanks Alexa Anderson for the video.,0.6908,0.575,0,97,0

A mais nova versão da ferramenta do momento (e do futuro próximo aparentemente), o GPT-4. Trata-se de uma evolução da GPT-3.5, daOpenAI.Além de ter sido retreinada durante 6 meses com muito mais dados, o que mais me surpreendeu foi o fato da nova versão permitir o uso de imagens como input. No caso em questão, de uma simples anotação em um print (conforme imagem abaixo), ele foi capaz de gerar um website em HTML, atendendo as especificações.Acredito que é só o começo de uma infinidade de possibilidades de valor que as IA’s vão nos permitir gerar nos próximos anos.

Yeganeh Soltanpour,15-03-2023,"In today's rapidly evolving world, change is inevitable. When faced with change, one can either embrace it and learn from it, or risk missing out on the benefits it offers. This is especially true when it comes to the advancements in technology, such as ChatGPT, BingAI, and other similar tools that are now making their way into the mainstream. While these tools have been around for some time, their recent acceptance by the wider public has been remarkable. Nonetheless, there is a certain apprehension surrounding the use of AI, given its potential for harm.However, the application of AI to perform routine or menial tasks, which are often prone to human error or negligence, is an exciting development. By linking ChatGPT to my Alexa, for instance, I was able to easily access relevant articles pertaining to my field (which is how I came across the linked article). This is just one example of how AI can be utilised to enhance efficiency and accuracy in our day-to-day activities.Looking ahead, it is possible to envision AI being utilised in student visa applications. The potential benefits such as limiting the number of mistakes made, sometimes by students or agents, which can lead to delays in visa processing times may be something we can reduce. It is an exciting prospect, and one that we should all keep an eye on as we move forward.#ai#Chatgpt#aiforgood",0.9612,0.5962585034013606,2 ,9,0

I have a question for your live.I have a Junior in High School, she’s a very good student. But this year has been mentally draining and exhausting for her. She doesn’t want to go to school, mornings are very stressful for me. She has outbursts and tantrums getting ready for school and I don’t know what to do about it. I’m tired of lying to the school so she can go in late and get out early and miss school completely and I feel it’s only enabling her more. I understand and sympathize about how she feels but this is life and she needs to learn how to deal with it. Do I let her face the consequences of missing classes without my help do I continue to help and push her out the door? How can I navigate through this?",-0.9788,0.4907142857142857,0,3,0

Trip O'Dell,15-03-2023,"As a designer, I find work like this ethically problematic.The robot is cute, but its designers are intentionally “playing” with a human cognitive bias where we treat things that look and behave like humans as if they are human.It was a line we were very careful not to cross when I was working at Amazon on Alexa. We even had a principle that “she” is a computer, not a person - because its very easy to wander into unethical areas when you have a device in your home that has your credit card number and can manipulate people who are lonely, or too trusting to act against their interests.As designers, a good bit of our work involves “lying” to users. A “user friendly” experience builds on familar metaphor, often representing functionality with a more familiar concept so people have an easier time using the software, and can anticipate how it might work.Consider the “trash can” on your computer, Its a helpful illusion for what happens to a file, but under the hood the root level command is something like “rm -i mydir/*”. The command is hard to remember, and requires a lot more advanced knowledge of the system to use it. So the illusion of a trash can, while innacurate, is a helpful illusion (lie) to help a normal user understand what’s happening.This isn’t the case here. The designers are creating an illusion of child-like behaviors, and eliciting our instinct to engage, nurture, play with and protect a child (notice the oversized head and big eyes?)…but its unclear why that’s necessary in this case, or to what end?This robot was developed by a multi-billion dollar corporation. Their business model depends on the “willing suspension of disbelief”. Disney needs us to love its characters and stories, to believe in “magic” and emotionally invest in their intellectual property to keep expensive theme parks and movie theaters filled, purchase their toys and subscribe to their services. They make great movies and world-class experiences but we know these things aren’t real. That isn’t what is happening here.The ethics of human-centered design requires we put people ahead of#technology, that the experiences we design are trustworthy, using metaphor and illusion only as a means to help users anticipate outcomes or understand the system they are working in.Disney is creating an illusion that evokes an emotional connection and engenders a sense of trust that the technology is incapable of  reciprocating. It can easily be used to manipulate us.Playing with our emotional response is uncomfortably close to the tactics used by con artists to prey on the trust and goodwill of their victims.This is an experiment, but corporations don’t sink millions into R&D with emotional connection as their ultimate goal.Be wary of technology that pretends to care about you. A gizmo can never “love” you back, and there is always a wizard behind the curtian (and a marketing team) pulling at those heart strings to see how much money comes out.",0.9984,0.6211538461538461,6 ,35,0

Offered by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, PSSS is a 3-month long early career development experience to help prepare the next generation of planetary science and engineering mission leaders. Participants learn the process of developing a science hypothesis-driven robotic space mission in a concurrent engineering environment while getting an in-depth, first-hand look at mission design, life cycle, costs, schedule and the trade-offs inherent in each.Science and engineering doctoral candidates, recent Ph.D.’s, postdocs, junior faculty, and certain master’s degree students, who are U.S. Citizens or legal permanent residents (and a very limited number of Foreign Nationals from non-designated countries), are eligible. Applicants from diverse backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply. Diversity, equity and inclusion are important to us, and we strive to create a welcoming environment where participants’ contributions and unique perspectives are valued.Session 1: May 11-August 4.Session 2: May 25-August 18.Roughly equivalent in workload to a rigorous 3-hour graduate-level course, participants spend the majority of the first 12 weeks in preparatory webinars acting as a science mission team, prior to spending the final culminating week being mentored by JPL’s Advance Project Design Team, or “Team-X” to refine their planetary science mission concept design, then present it to a mock expert review board.To apply and learn more about the NASA Science Mission Design Schools:https://lnkd.in/gRd5KJKa",0.8952,0.3525689223057644,0,7,5

Another work package is devoted to assessing#societalimpact, environmental burden, and a cost/benefit analysis of the reduced noise and emissions by HOPE technology.

Code6,15-03-2023,"The Blink Video Doorbell is down to an all&time low of $35.Amazon has rolled out another sale on smart home devices from its Blink brand, bringing a range of video doorbells and security cameras back down to, or at least near, their lowest prices to date. If you're comfortable with the idea of having an Amazon camera outside of your home, one highlight is the Blink Video Doorbell for $35. That matches the device's all-time low, coming in $15 below Amazon's list price and about $10 off the average street price we've seen in recent months. If you're thinking of picking up a Blink cam for the first time, note that a bundle that pairs the Video Doorbell with the company's Sync Module 2 — which lets you view the camera's live feed on-demand and utilize local storage — is down to $59, which is about $15 off its usual going rate and $5 more than the best price we've tracked.Blink is essentially the budget counterpart to Amazon's other major smart home subsidiary, Ring. Its Video Doorbell is much more basic than a pricier option like Arlo's Essential Video Doorbell, the top pick from our guide to the best smart home devices, but it still delivers serviceable 1080p video, night vision and the ability to see and speak to people at your door regardless of where you are. The whole thing is relatively easy to install, and it can run off wired power or a couple of AA batteries. Blink says the device can get up to two years of juice, depending on how hard it's put into use.That said, the camera's field of view (135 degrees horizontal, 80 degrees vertical) isn't as wide as higher-end options, and it only works with Amazon's Alexa assistant, not alternative platforms like Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant or IFTTT. And while you don't need any add-ons, the doorbell's storage and live view options are limited without the Sync Module or one of Blink's subscription plans. Without the Module, you'll only receive alerts and a live view when the doorbell senses activity or someone presses its button. Still, this is a worthy option for those looking to install a competent, battery-powered doorbell cam for as little money as possible. Beyond the Video Doorbell, other notable deals include a two-camera kit of Blink's Outdoor security cam, another pick from our best smart home device guide, for $104. That's $5 more than the lowest price we've seen. The sale includes several bundles that mix and match various camera options as well.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget athttps://lnkd.in/gb2TGFmfhttps://lnkd.in/g8vW-uxH",0.9899,0.4594304388422035,0,0,0

With AI's continued growth and development, it's clear that it's going to play an even more significant role in shaping our world in the years to come.From personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous cars and drones, AI is already making a huge impact in our everyday lives. And as the technology progresses, it's going to continue to revolutionize industries like healthcare, finance, transportation, and more.One of the most exciting things about the future of AI is its potential to help us solve some of the world's most pressing challenges. From climate change to healthcare, AI has the ability to process large amounts of data and generate insights that can help us make more informed decisions.Of course, with the great potential of AI comes responsibility. It's important that we continue to have discussions around AI ethics and make sure that the development of AI is guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and fairness.As professionals, it's essential that we stay up to date with the latest developments in AI and understand how it can be applied to our respective fields. By embracing AI and continuing to learn about its capabilities, we can ensure that we are well-positioned to thrive in the new age of technology.So let's stay curious and keep exploring the exciting possibilities of AI together!#AI#future#growth#healthcare#healthcare#finance#artificialintelligence#data#ai#transportation#climatechange#developmentI#futuretech#innovation#technology#machinelearning",0.9942,0.6168446368446369,0,0,0

Within the research process, the AD100 decorator dived deep into japonisme, the 18th-century French interpretation (and incorporation) of Japanese style. eAfter trade routes between the two countries opened following the period of sakoku, when Japan closed its borders to the Western world, French creatives were exposed to a restrained, uncluttered aesthetic entirely different from their own, typically more ornate design language. For the next decade, Japan would influence French modernists from Edgar Degas to Charlotte Perriand.King, who is based in New York City, was immediately fascinated. “It was a movement that radically transformed Europe’s visual culture and permeated fine arts, sculpture, performing arts, architecture, industrial and furniture design, interiors as well as textile and decorative arts,” he explains. “The Japanese elicited the French to question the division between artist and designer and moved them to elevate the contributions of craftsmen. This principle interested me as the melding of craft and contemporary design.”ACB CREATIVE",0.9291,0.23103030303030306,1 ,6,0

Dr. Volker Meise,15-03-2023,"""Disruptive"", ""insane"", ""mindblowing"" - immer, wenn neue Technologie so beschrieben wird, bin ich skeptisch. Nicht so bei#GTP-4 , der neuen Version des KI-Modells u.a. hinter#ChatGPT- denn die Auswirkungen sind kaum zu überschätzen. Hier die wichtigsten Fakten, warum.💪 Mehr Parameter: GPT-4 kann noch mehr Daten verarbeiten und komplexere Texte generieren als GPT-3, denn GPT-4 hat 170 Billionen Parameter im Vergleich zu 175 Milliarden von GPT-3.💪 Größere Trainingsmenge: GPT-4 wurde mit 45 GB Trainingsdaten angelernt, während bei GPT-3 nur 17 GB verwendet wurden. Dadurch hat GPT-4 hat mehr Wissen, versteht Kontext besser und macht weniger Fehler.💪 Bilder als Input: GPT-4 akzeptiert Bilder als Eingabe, versteht deren Inhalt und kann daraus Beschriftungen, Klassifizierungen und Analysen erzeugen (""multimodal"").Insgesamt ist GPT-4 in der Lage, Texte mit größerer Kohärenz und Natürlichkeit zu erzeugen als GPT-3. Es kann Aufgaben erledigen, die Textverständnis und Zusammenhänge erfordern - wie z.B. Zusammenfassungen. Und das war schon beim alten ChatGPT beeindruckend zu erleben.Die Auswirkungen werden weitreichend sein:⭐ Beratung und Forschung reloaded: Schon jetzt ist GPT-4 beeindruckend gut darin, komplexe Zusammenhänge zu verstehen und neu zu sortieren, etwa die Zusammensetzung von Medikamenten zu erkennen und Alternativen vorzuschlagen. Wird es mit Spezialdaten trainiert (bspw. allen wissenschaftlichen Artikeln eines Fachgebietes), können in kürzester Zeit Analysen erstellt werden, die früher aufgrund des Aufwands sehr lange gedauert haben oder gar nicht erst in Angriff genommen wurden.⭐ Call-Center werden den Weg der Zeitungen gehen: Sie werden komplett digital oder zur Nische, denn die Mensch-Maschine Kommunikation springt auf ein neues Level. Bisher musste man bei Chatbots mögliche Antworten der Nutzer:innen voraussehen, um sinnvolle Antworten bereitzuhalten. GPT-4 versteht auch komplexe Fragen und erzeugt realistische Antworten - die dann als Text oder (KI-generiert) in natürlicher Sprache ausgegeben werden.⭐ Wir werden unseren Augen nicht mehr trauen können: KI-basierte Dienste wie DALL-E, Midjourney oder Stable Diffusion sind bereits jetzt extrem gut in der Erzeugung von realistischen Fotos auf der Basis von Textbeschreibungen. Mit realen Fotos trainiert, können neue Bilder einer Person mit beliebigen Gesichtsausdrücken in frei wählbarer Umgebung generiert werden. Kleiner Nebeneffekt: Stockfoto-Portale werden überflüssig.⭐ Alte Fähigkeiten werden wertlos, neue Fertigkeiten sind gefragt: Einfache Texte schreiben oder simplen Programmcode erstellen? Das kann die Maschine ab jetzt besser und schneller. In Zukunft braucht es Fähigkeiten, die KI-Tools so zu steuern, dass das gewünschte Ergebnis herauskommt (""prompt engineering"").Kurz: ""Mindblowing"". Und ich bin mir sicher, dass noch längst nicht alles ist. Da kommt noch mehr.https://lnkd.in/emttWY-J#GPT4#ChatGPT#KI#AI#Disruption#digitaleTransformation",-0.9904,0.5,0,0,0
Hays,15-03-2023,"👨‍💻 ChatGPT – an artificial intelligence programme with the capability to pass law exams, write code, and even compose poetry – has taken the world by storm since its launch at the end of 2022.The tool, developed byOpenAI, has many considering what the future holds for the world of work – especially as its capabilities are so human-like, it’s often nearly impossible to detect when it has been used to produce a piece of content.So, we decided to put it to the test. We tasked ChatGPT and a copywriter to concisely explain how to impress at a job interview – and the results are surprisingly similar.🤔 The question is, can YOU detect which answer was written by the AI programme?

Tria,15-03-2023,"New ChatGPT version arrived today! Have you already adopted ChatGPT in your company? 🚀As a forward-thinking software development company, we’re always on the lookout for the latest advancements in technology that can help us deliver high-quality projects to our clients.And while we firmly believe that AI will never replace our talented developers because human ingenuity is irreplaceable, we’re confident that ChatGPT can enhance several processes in the long term. That’s why we adopted this solution, and we encourage our employees to use it. 🤗Many companies have limited or even forbidden the use of ChatGPT across their workforce, that’s why we asked our CEODavorfor his thoughts on the matter. 👇Davor emphasized that embracing ChatGPT can significantly boost the speed and development of the industry. As OpenAI and other organizations continue to improve language models like ChatGPT, it's crucial for us to adopt this new technology sooner rather than later, so we can stay ahead of the curve and respond effectively to the changes the future will bring.Davor also highlighted the importance of using AI responsibly. He encourages our developers to leverage ChatGPT as a complementary tool to their skills, as long as they understand the end result and its implications.“By striking the right balance between human expertise and AI-driven innovation, we can rapidly enhance our understanding of development, while maintaining a strong foundation in our core skills and knowledge.”We also asked our colleagues for feedback on their experience with ChatGPT, and we have to admit that the responses have been quite diverse. 👀While some team members have found it extremely helpful in answering their questions because it gives us the ability to solve our specific cases rather than googling some general examples, others remain unimpressed with given results.And of course, there are those who have playfully attempted to outsmart ChatGPT. They're tossing all sorts of wild questions, twisty tongue-twisters, and goofy riddles at it, just to see if they can trip up the AI. But that's a natural thing to do. And it brings so much laughter to our office. 😂And even though ChatGPT sometimes totally nails it, leaving our pranksters scratching their heads, other times the AI gets all tangled up and can't quite figure things out.We believe this is a great reminder that AI might be super advanced, but it's still got some catching up to do when it comes to our quirky human brains. 🤓#chatgpt#artificialintelligence#softwaredevelopment#Tria",0.991,0.5363782613782615,0,0,0

Bu teknolojiyi erken benimseyenler arasında web sitelerini taramak ve müşteri destek personeline bir özet sunmak için GPT-4 kullanan Stripe ve GPT-4’ü yeni bir dil öğrenme aboneliğine yerleştiren Duolingo yer alıyor.OpenAI’e göre GPT-4, resim ve metin girişlerini kabul edip algılayabiliyor- yalnızca metin kabul eden selefi GPT-3.5’e göre bu büyük bir gelişme- ve çeşitli profesyonel ve akademik ölçütlerde “insan düzeyinde” performans gösteriyor. Örneğin GPT-3, simüle edilmiş bir bar sınavını, sınava girenlerin ilk %10’u civarında bir puanla geçebiliyordu.Şirkete göre OpenAI, ChatGPT’nin yanı sıra bir rakip test programından alınan dersleri kullanarak GPT-4’ü yinelemeli olarak hizalamak için altı ay harcadı ve şirkete göre gerçeklik, yönlendirilebilirlik ve sınırların dışına çıkmayı reddetme konularında “şimdiye kadarki en iyi sonuçları” sağladı.OpenAI, GPT-4’ü duyuran bir blog yazısında, “Sıradan bir sohbette, GPT-3.5 ve GPT-4 arasındaki fark ince olabilir. Fark, görevin karmaşıklığı yeterli bir eşiğe ulaştığında ortaya çıkıyor.

Ian Matthews,15-03-2023,"If your team is using HubSpot's ticketing system, this one is for you. (Or maybe it will convince you to give it a try)I've set up a way to get ChatGPT to automatically draft a response to any support question, and add this to your HubSpot ticket. The idea is a support rep can then review this response, edit it if needed or just go ahead and send as is., all directly from your HubSpot ticket.Just playing around with the possibilities right now but this is a great example of how AI can help teams scale their customer support and service!

Eric De Cock,15-03-2023,"Waarom ChatGPT-4 de beste keuze is voor uw bedrijfscommunicatie: de evolutie van GPT-3 naar GPT-4 🚀De afgelopen jaren heeft OpenAI indrukwekkende prestaties geleverd met hun reeks taalmodellen, zoals GPT-3 en nu ChatGPT-4. In dit artikel zullen we de belangrijkste verschillen tussen GPT-3 en GPT-4 bespreken en uitleggen waarom de upgrade naar ChatGPT-4 uw bedrijf aanzienlijke voordelen kan opleveren.✅ Verbeterde taalbegrip en nauwkeurigheid:ChatGPT-4 is getraind met meer gegevens en geavanceerdere technieken dan zijn voorganger, GPT-3. Dit resulteert in een beter begrip van context en nuance in gesprekken, waardoor het model nauwkeuriger en nuttiger is voor bedrijfscommunicatie. Bedrijven kunnen profiteren van deze verbeterde nauwkeurigheid door minder tijd te besteden aan het corrigeren van gegenereerde teksten en meer vertrouwen te hebben in de output van het model.✅ Snellere respons- en verwerkingstijden:Dankzij optimalisaties en technologische vooruitgang in GPT-4, kunnen bedrijven genieten van snellere respons- en verwerkingstijden in vergelijking met GPT-3. Dit betekent dat uw team sneller toegang heeft tot de benodigde informatie en effectiever kan communiceren, zowel intern als met klanten.✅ Betere aanpassingsmogelijkheden:ChatGPT-4 biedt geavanceerdere opties voor aanpassing en personalisatie, waardoor het gemakkelijker is om het model af te stemmen op de specifieke behoeften van uw bedrijf. Dit kan variëren van het trainen van het model op bedrijfsspecifieke terminologie tot het instellen van de gewenste tone of voice. Dit zorgt voor naadloze integratie en consistente merkcommunicatie.✅ Robuustere contextbehoud:Een van de uitdagingen bij eerdere modellen, zoals GPT-3, was het beperkte vermogen om context over langere tekstreeksen te behouden. ChatGPT-4 is beter in staat om context te behouden, wat resulteert in betere, meer samenhangende en zinvolle output. Dit leidt tot effectievere communicatie en een betere gebruikerservaring voor zowel medewerkers als klanten.✅ Veiliger en verantwoord gebruik:ChatGPT-4 heeft verbeterde mechanismen voor het omgaan met gevoelige informatie en het voorkomen van ongepaste content. Dit maakt het model veiliger en betrouwbaarder voor bedrijfsdoeleinden, waardoor bedrijven met een gerust hart kunnen vertrouwen op ChatGPT-4 voor hun communicatiebehoeften.🙋‍♂️ Persoonlijke conclusie:De overstap naar ChatGPT-4 biedt bedrijven aanzienlijke voordelen ten opzichte van GPT-3, waaronder verbeterde nauwkeurigheid, snellere verwerkingstijden, betere personalisatie, robuuster contextbehoud en verhoogde veiligheid. Deze verbeteringen zorgen voor effectievere en efficiëntere communicatie, waardoor bedrijven meer tijd en middelen kunnen besteden aan strategische en creatieve taken die hun groei stimuleren.#ChatGPT4#OpenAI#Bedrijfscommunicatie#AI#KunstmatigeIntelligentie#Innovatie#Digitalisering#Efficiëntie#Klantenservice#Groeistrategie",-0.5994,0.0,0,0,0
"🌟 Michael Stuck, JD ⚖️",15-03-2023,"There’s been no end to the headlines about ChatGPT lately, but one that I found extra interesting was: “ChatGPT Passes Google Coding Interview for Level 3 Engineer With $183K Salary.”PC Magazine reports that Google ran an experiment where it fed coding interview questions to the AI chatbot, and it passed with flying colors.Now, the caveat: this specific interview process mostly covers technical questions, which the chatbot is particularly good at. But ChatGPT might not be so adept at answering behavioral prompts like “Tell me about a time you overcame adversity.”But give it a few years.As a recruiter for 28+ years, I have witnessed the fear of AI replacing the workforce ebb and flow over the years. In the end, real human talent possesses attributes chatbots never will. And those human attributes will always be key to the jobs that matter most.#ChatGPT#HRandAI",0.8761,0.3979166666666667,0,0,0

Ehrenmüller GmbH,15-03-2023,"Wahrscheinlich habt ihr es schon mitbekommen: Die neue Version von ChatGPT ist verfügbar! 🦾Im Gegensatz zu dem Vorgängermodell ist die KI nun nicht mehr nur an Text gebunden. GPT-4 kann Bilder verstehen und analysieren, wie in der Beispielgrafik zu sehen ist.Es ist somit ein multimodales System, das im Gegensatz zu ChatGPT nicht nur mit Text gefüttert werden kann, sondern Text- und Bildverständnis kombiniert. Es kann z.B. komplizierte Zusammenhänge in einer Grafik verstehen und einfach erklären.Das System soll den Menschen außerdem bei kreativen Problemstellungen noch besser zur Seite stehen. So kann die KI beispielsweise beim Schreiben von technischen Texten oder Songs Hilfe leisten.Da GPT-4 natürlich keine unternehmensspezifischen bzw. -internen Daten und Zusammenhänge kennt, stößt die KI im Business-Kontext an ihre Grenzen.Die Technologie hinter GPT-4 ist dafür allerdings sehr spannend.➡️ Mehr dazu in dem Paper vonOpenAI:https://lnkd.in/dgYXBPFqWir freuen uns schon darauf, sie in unseren Projekten auf individuelle Fragestellungen anzupassen und einzusetzen. 👩‍💻#Chatgpt#gpt4#Künstlicheintelligenz#artificialintelligence#texterkennung#bilderkennung",-0.9508,0.0,0,3,0

Luka Kankaras,15-03-2023,"ChatGPT AI's freemium strategy - 4 simple takeaways:1.

Right value metric to upsell to the premium (Plus) plan• While the free version sufficed for basic tasks, it didn't quite cut it for those who spent hours on ChatGPT.• The limit of use & API access created a virtual barrier for the most powerful users to signup for the ""Plus"" plan.3. Rapid promotion through its Plus plan evangelists (emotional & social motivation)• You know those super enthusiastic people who knock on your door and try to convert you to their religion? Well, that's basically what happened to the ""Plus"" plan users.• Plus plan users turned into ChatGPT evangelists and flooded Twitter and Reddit with posts bragging about their premium experience.• It's like they were saying, ""Hey, look at me, I'm on the VIP list and you're not! Don't you want to be cool like me?"" It's hard not to get FOMO when they're waving their fancy features in your face.4. Exclusivity of new products to specific user segments by allowing only ""Plus"" users to even try Chat GPT4 & to a limit.• a fancy gated community for the new version, i.e. a walled garden around itself that only ""Plus"" users could enter, and even then, it is like they are only allowed to peek inside for a limited time.• Even better, if you want to join and stay in this exclusive club, you gotta pay up and keep paying up every year.#openai#chatgpt#freemium#productgrowth#pmf#gtmstrategy",0.9936,0.5547922077922078,0,1,0

Ein wesentlicher Teil meiner Arbeit liegt darin, herauszufinden, was meinem Auftraggeber hilft, was für das Produkt sinnvoll ist und wie wir die Zielgruppe optimal ansprechen. Dann erst schreibe ich. Bei einigen meiner besten Projekte hatte ich aber gar kein oder nur ein sehr dürftiges Briefing und das ist nicht ungewöhnlich.Unter anderem geht es um Intention und Perspektive. Hat ChatGPT nicht, müsst Ihr ihm vorgeben. Doch habt Ihr Euer Profil, Eure Absichten bereits definiert, kennt Ihr die Bedürfnisse Eurer Zielgruppe? Dann muss aber immer noch jemand die Texte abnehmen, auch weil ChatGPT – und das ist systemimmanent – herrlichen Quatsch generiert.ChatGPT macht für Unternehmen und Projektleiter nichts einfacher, es ist eher wie IKEA und verlagert Aufgaben zum Kunden. Aber um Texte zusammenzustöpseln, wird ein Fünfer-Inbus nicht reichen, und Textverständnis ist in Deutschland ein knappes Gut. ChatGPT berät auch nicht, es hat keine Personality, die müsst Ihr schon selbst mitbringen. Jemand muss ChatGPT sehr genau sagen, was es tun soll. Umso nötiger ist ein präzises Briefing, was vorab eine klare Strategie, Profiling und Positionierung erfordert. Und können wir schauen, ob ChatGPT das geeignete Tool ist.#storytelling#scriptwriting#ai#communications#profiling#positionierung",-0.9337,0.0,0,1,0

Dr. Andree Bates,15-03-2023,"A recent study, scheduled to be presented at an upcoming computer vision conference, demonstrates that#AIcan read#brainscansand re-create largely realistic versions of images a person has seen.As this technology develops, researchers say, it could have numerous applications, from exploring how various animal species perceive the world to perhaps one day recording human dreams and aiding communication in people with paralysis.Many labs have used AI to read brain scans and re-create images a subject has recently seen, such as human faces and photos of landscapes. The new study marks the first time an AI algorithm called Stable Diffusion, developed by a German group and publicly released in 2022, has been used to do this. Stable Diffusion is similar to other text-to-image “generative” AIs such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, which produce new images from text prompts after being trained on billions of images associated with text descriptions.Unlike previous efforts using AI algorithms to decipher brain scans, which had to be trained on large data sets, Stable Diffusion was able to get more out of less training for each participant by incorporating photo captions into the algorithm. It’s a novel approach that incorporates textual and visual information to “decipher the brain,” says Ariel Goldstein, a cognitive neuroscientist at Princeton University who was not involved with the work.",0.891,0.3140692640692641,0,0,0

Dr. Volker Meise,15-03-2023,"""Disruptive"", ""insane"", ""mindblowing"" - immer, wenn neue Technologie so beschrieben wird, bin ich skeptisch. Nicht so bei#GTP-4 , der neuen Version des KI-Modells u.a. hinter#ChatGPT- denn die Auswirkungen sind kaum zu überschätzen. Hier die wichtigsten Fakten, warum.💪 Mehr Parameter: GPT-4 kann noch mehr Daten verarbeiten und komplexere Texte generieren als GPT-3, denn GPT-4 hat 170 Billionen Parameter im Vergleich zu 175 Milliarden von GPT-3.💪 Größere Trainingsmenge: GPT-4 wurde mit 45 GB Trainingsdaten angelernt, während bei GPT-3 nur 17 GB verwendet wurden. Dadurch hat GPT-4 hat mehr Wissen, versteht Kontext besser und macht weniger Fehler.💪 Bilder als Input: GPT-4 akzeptiert Bilder als Eingabe, versteht deren Inhalt und kann daraus Beschriftungen, Klassifizierungen und Analysen erzeugen (""multimodal"").Insgesamt ist GPT-4 in der Lage, Texte mit größerer Kohärenz und Natürlichkeit zu erzeugen als GPT-3. Es kann Aufgaben erledigen, die Textverständnis und Zusammenhänge erfordern - wie z.B. Zusammenfassungen. Und das war schon beim alten ChatGPT beeindruckend zu erleben.Die Auswirkungen werden weitreichend sein:⭐ Beratung und Forschung reloaded: Schon jetzt ist GPT-4 beeindruckend gut darin, komplexe Zusammenhänge zu verstehen und neu zu sortieren, etwa die Zusammensetzung von Medikamenten zu erkennen und Alternativen vorzuschlagen. Wird es mit Spezialdaten trainiert (bspw. allen wissenschaftlichen Artikeln eines Fachgebietes), können in kürzester Zeit Analysen erstellt werden, die früher aufgrund des Aufwands sehr lange gedauert haben oder gar nicht erst in Angriff genommen wurden.⭐ Call-Center werden den Weg der Zeitungen gehen: Sie werden komplett digital oder zur Nische, denn die Mensch-Maschine Kommunikation springt auf ein neues Level. Bisher musste man bei Chatbots mögliche Antworten der Nutzer:innen voraussehen, um sinnvolle Antworten bereitzuhalten. GPT-4 versteht auch komplexe Fragen und erzeugt realistische Antworten - die dann als Text oder (KI-generiert) in natürlicher Sprache ausgegeben werden.⭐ Wir werden unseren Augen nicht mehr trauen können: KI-basierte Dienste wie DALL-E, Midjourney oder Stable Diffusion sind bereits jetzt extrem gut in der Erzeugung von realistischen Fotos auf der Basis von Textbeschreibungen. Mit realen Fotos trainiert, können neue Bilder einer Person mit beliebigen Gesichtsausdrücken in frei wählbarer Umgebung generiert werden. Kleiner Nebeneffekt: Stockfoto-Portale werden überflüssig.⭐ Alte Fähigkeiten werden wertlos, neue Fertigkeiten sind gefragt: Einfache Texte schreiben oder simplen Programmcode erstellen? Das kann die Maschine ab jetzt besser und schneller. In Zukunft braucht es Fähigkeiten, die KI-Tools so zu steuern, dass das gewünschte Ergebnis herauskommt (""prompt engineering"").Kurz: ""Mindblowing"". Und ich bin mir sicher, dass noch längst nicht alles ist. Da kommt noch mehr.https://lnkd.in/emttWY-J#GPT4#ChatGPT#KI#AI#Disruption#digitaleTransformation",-0.9904,0.5,4 ,3,0

Jednak, jeśli jesteście jednoosobową działalnością gospodarczą na 𝘇𝗮𝘀𝗮𝗱𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗿𝘆𝗰𝘇𝗮ł𝘁𝘂 od przychodów ewidencjonowanych, to sytuacja już się komplikuje.Standardowo, aby dochód był przyjęty do analizy, działalność musi być prowadzona od min. 12 lub 24 miesięcy, jednak od tej zasady również występują wyjątki. Ciągłość zatrudnienia wpływa na minimalny wymagany staż uzyskiwania dochodu z działalności gospodarczej. Jeśli nie prowadzicie działalności na szeroką skalę i nie ma wysokich kosztów, to ryczałt może być dla Was korzystnym rozwiązaniem. W zależności od rodzaju wykonywanych usług dla programistów dostępne są dwie stawki ryczałtu: 8,5% i 12%Niestety, banki w większości podchodzą do ryczałtu bardzo zachowawczo, tłumacząc to niemożnością wyliczenia dochodu względem uzyskiwanych przychodów. Jednak, nie traćcie nadziei! Jesteśmy tu, aby pomóc Wam w znalezieniu rozwiązań dla Waszych potrzeb.𝗡𝗮𝗷𝘄𝗮𝘇̇𝗻𝗶𝗲𝗷𝘀𝘇𝘆 𝘄 𝘁𝗲𝗷 𝘀𝘆𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗰𝗷𝗶 𝗷𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗻𝘆 𝘄𝘆𝗯𝗼́𝗿 𝗯𝗮𝗻𝗸𝗼́𝘄 𝗸𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘆𝘁𝘂𝗷𝗮̨𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗵. Różnice w zdolności kredytowej potrafią być ogromne np. w banku A może nam wyjść zdolność na poziomie 150 000 zł natomiast w banku B, który postrzega ryczałt o wiele lepiej wyjdzie 600 000 zł.Co możecie zrobić, aby mieć większe szanse na kredyt hipoteczny na ryczałcie?• Kilka miesięcy przed planowanym terminem złożenia wniosku kredytowego zadajcie sobie pytanie, jakie przychody w kolejnych miesiącach będą dla Was najbardziej korzystne. Stabilne kwoty na fakturach będą dla banku ważnym sygnałem, że Wasza sytuacja finansowa jest stabilna.• Jeśli Wasz partner pracuje na etacie i zawarł z pracodawcą umowę na czas nieokreślony, warto rozważyć wspólne wnioskowanie o kredyt.• Warto upewnić się, że macie terminowo uregulowane wszystkie zobowiązania wobec Urzędu Skarbowego i Zakładu Ubezpieczeń Społecznych oraz dbać o terminowość przyszłych płatności.• Ostatecznie, nie wnioskujcie o kredyt hipoteczny samodzielnie, jeśli rynek produktów bankowych jest dla Was jedną wielką niewiadomą. Wybór przypadkowego kredytodawcy może przekreślić szanse na otrzymanie finansowania lub narazić Was na dodatkowe koszty. Warto skorzystać z usług eksperta w dziedzinie kredytów hipotecznych - polecam siebie.Ciekawostka: Grafika wygenerowana z pomocą oprogramowania DALL-E 2 🤓",0.5178,0.0,1 ,2,0

Il nome DALL-E deriva dalla combinazione dei nomi dell'artista surrealista Salvador Dalì e del personaggio animato Pixar Wall-E.Il funzionamento di DALL-E è basato su una tecnica di apprendimento profondo chiamata ""generative adversarial network"" (GAN), in cui due reti neurali si ""sfidano"" a creare contenuti: una rete genera le immagini e l'altra le valuta e le confronta con quelle reali, cercando di individuare le differenze e le somiglianze.

Mukesh Manral🇮🇳,15-03-2023,"🔴 Timeline view of different deep learning approaches in Natural Language Processing that have been developed to improve this field:👉  2014: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber. LSTMs address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs and enable the network to retain long-term dependencies in the input sequence.👉  2014: Google introduces the Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) system, which uses a combination of deep learning approaches, including LSTMs, to improve machine translation accuracy.👉  2015: Attention Mechanism👉  2016: CNNs are applied to natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and sentiment analysis. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.👉  2017: Transfer learning becomes popular in natural language processing, allowing pre-trained models to be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Examples of this approach include the OpenAI language model GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) introduced by Google.👉  2018: Transformer model is introduced by Vaswani et al. Uses self-attention instead of RNNs to process input sequences, resulting in faster training and better performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.👉  2019: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are applied to text generation and style transfer. This approach allows the model to learn the underlying structure of the input data and generate new data that is similar to the training data.👉  2020: Pre-trained language models such as GPT-3, introduced by OpenAI, achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks, and are used as a starting point for further fine-tuning on specific tasks.👉  GPT-3 (2020): This language model, developed by OpenAI, achieved state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing tasks, including language generation, question-answering, and language translation.👉  CLIP (2021): Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training model developed by OpenAI, which is capable of learning representations of both images and text in a joint space.👉 DALL-E (2021): model that generates images from textual descriptions using a combination of transformers and a generative adversarial network (GAN).👉MLP-Mixer (2021): new architecture for image classification, which uses only multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and no convolutional layers.👉 Perceiver (2021): new architecture for image recognition, which uses a combination of transformers and MLPs to process input data.👉 Swin Transformer (2021): new transformer-based architecture for object detection in images, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.👉 SETR (2021): another transformer-based architecture for image segmentation, which achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.",0.9531,0.3869146005509643,0,0,0

Sekura Mobile Intelligence,15-03-2023,"GPT-4 is a game-changer for our industry -Gautam Hazari,Sekura Mobile IntelligenceChief Technology Officer reviews yesterday's live demo and foregrounds what is going to be a step-change for identity and security...""There are 2 key features in GPT-4 which are mind-blowing: it can process images. In the live demo today, a hand-drawn note for a web page was photographed with a phone camera and was fed into a GPT-4 trained model, which GPT-4 interpreted as a requirement to create a website - and it did just that!It created a functioning website, with the look and feel of the hand-written diagram on the page of a notebook. So, going forward, text-based inputs are not going to create any limitations; it can be images and hand-written notes, combined with text if needed.It can process very large documents - from various domains, including legal, contractual and even tax-related documents. In the live demo, GPT-4 came up with tax return calculations based on the tax regulations and even provided explanations referring to the sections of the tax laws. So, contract red-lining can be done by GPT-4 much more efficiently and within minutes.The implications to our industry will be many, here are just some:‣ Sophisticated account takeover frauds: GPT-4 can be trained using the reinforced learning methods (basically complementing the already trained model with additional specific details), by feeding handwritten notes, letters, electronic communications etc.‣ Personalised and realistic phishing messages: Re-trained GPT-4 model can generate phishing messages which will look like coming from known and genuine sources‣ New creative attack vectors: This is an outcome of Generative AI - including GPT-4 and DALL-E/DALL-E 2, which will create new attack vectors, including Synthetic ID attacks and beyond. GPT-4 can be trained to write code to automate those attacks and even personalise the attacks to industrialise targeted attack vectors.""Thanks, Gautam. Clearly, we will need robust methods of preventing new attack vectors; Sekura's API focuses on the SIM as a true possession factor using 66 separate potential fraud signals providing extremely strong fraud detection coupled with an awesome UX for the user.The SAFr framework continues to develop in line with AI & ML advances too.

It can’t however generate images (like Dall-E).- GPT-4 scored around the top 10% in bar exams across different fields (medicine, biology, physics, math, economics, chemistry etc), in comparison, GPT 3.5 was in the bottom 10%.- It performs better in other languages (including Swahili) than even other large language models perform in English.- GPT-4 still has issues with hallucinations (spouting overconfident bs), however it performed 40% better than GPT-3.5 on tests that evaluate ability to stay factually accurate.- Bing was already using GPT-4 (without the image part). You have to join a waiting list to get access (without the image part at the moment) as developer or AI (ethics) researcher. For GPT Plus subscribers, it’s coming soon.- They are for some reason hiding the size of GPT-4 (number of parameters).

It involves defining the context, setting goals, selecting relevant datasets, and fine-tuning parameters to optimize the output. Basically, you manipulate what a Large Language Model does, instead of training your own (which is costly, believe me).Is there a demand for prompt engineers? 🤔#AIis currently a very hot topic, so it’s only natural that individuals who can make the most of AI tools are much in demand.

I also see more and more job offerings for prompt engineers arising, tempting with attractive salaries.

What is special is that it’s not limited to any field - be it#marketing,#salesor even#legal.What skills do I need to become a prompt engineer? ⚒Good news: you don’t necessarily have to be a data scientist.

While the idea of generating new ideas through prompts sounds intriguing, it's unclear to me how long such jobs can last in this rapidly evolving field:We are living in a gold rush, where identifying intriguing prompts seems to deliver a never-ending value; it currently feels like a frontier with no set rules, but in a year's time, they'll be probably organized, enabling one to locate the appropriate and compelling ones for their purpose; and that makes me wonder how sustainable this might be.Let's look at Dall-E, which suggests different art styles while rendering an image. I find it incredibly helpful, as it prompts me to ask for things I wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Will that be the role model to be providing prompts to the users so they can refine their results?What are your thoughts on the sustainability of high-paying jobs like prompt engineers? How important do you think prompts and examples are for generating new ideas? Let me know what you think!",0.9244,0.48910984848484845,0,3,0

Egy pillanatra a kis robot szüleinek érezzük magunk, akik bemutatják a szomszédnak a tehetséges gyermekük. Ahhoz hasonlítható büszke érzés, mint Karikó Katalinnak díjat átadni, vele fényképezkedni. A rivaldafényből pici sugár nekünk is jut, mi is átlényegülünk közben.Beállok hát én is a boldog-boldogtalanok sorába, és megosztom én is gondolataim!1. Mivel nincs személyes véleménye, és nem érzelmei irányítják, emiatt a beszélgetések folyamán kizárólag az adatokra támaszkodik.Wow, LEAN szemlélete van!Nem mondom, hogy arra a világra vágyom, hogy minden kollegám Chat GPT üzemmódba váltson, de néha segítene, ha tudnánk mindannyian váltogatni: meeting kicsit „AI” alapú, utána a kávézás inkább ember alapú.2. Egy egyetemi oktató ismerősöm mesélte, náluk az a megoldás várható, az írásbeliken nem tiltják meg a használatát, hanem az esszékbe integrálni kell a Chat GPT által összegyűjtött információkat, és azokat is véleményezni kell.Vow, egy fura, érzelem nélküli robot ösztönöz bennünket arra, hogy jobban támaszkodjunk érzelmeinkre és kreativitásunkra!3. Növelni kell a szóbeli vizsgák arányát, mivel ott kiderül az igazság, ki mit tud.Vow, a mesterséges intelligencia kényszeríti rá az emberiséget, hogy személyesebb kapcsolatot ápoljanak egymással, az oktatók és diákok többet beszélgessenek egymással.Ez az algoritmus az évszázad nagy tanítómestere, ha rajtam múlna, ő lenne az Év embere a Time magazin következő borítóján.Fruzsi lányomnak felolvastam a hvg Portré rovatában a vele készített interjút, egyik válasza különösen tetszett:„Olyan vagyok, mint egy szuperokos, de a társaságban esetlenül mozgó okostojás, akinek az intelligenciáját a haverjai-egy csomó lármás partiarc-folyvást játékos kérdésekkel tesztelik.

Cash flow (and working capital) issues are often just a symptom of more significant underlying ‘upstream’ problems that must be addressed.These are 10 of the most common root causes of financial problems in consultancies I am observing all the time:𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝟯 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗵 𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀1. Inefficient billing and collections: by far the #1 cash flow killer in consulting, it can screw up a consultancy big time;2. Scope creep: the silent killer of consultancy profitability and cash flow, definitely the #2 ‘upstream problem’ in consulting;3. Price it right: not charging competitive rates that reflect the value of the expertise, the #3 cash flow ‘eater’ in consulting;𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗴4. Underutilized team: if the consultancy's team isn't being utilized to its full potential, it’s leaving money on the table;5. Flying blind: the danger of running a consultancy with unreliable pipeline forecasting (I wrote a post about it yesterday);6. Overreliance on one client: a ticking time bomb. Diversify the client base to avoid a financial crash when the biggest client disappears;7. Inadequate cash reserves: a recipe for disaster, consultancies need at least 3 to 6 months of working capital;8. One-trick ponies: the danger of poor service offering design in consultancies, not targeted at retaining a client over a long period;9. Unnecessary expenses: inefficient expenses and cost management can drain the cash flow;10. Seasonality: don't let seasonality take you by surprise, the months of December, January, July, and August are quiet months in consulting.👉 HERE’S MY ADVICEIf you're experiencing cash flow (and/or working capital) issues in your consultancy, looking beyond the obvious reasons and considering all the possible root causes is essential.Go ‘upstream’...Remember that cash flow is not just about money coming in and going out, it's all about how you manage your consulting business.

Denis Rothman,15-03-2023,"GPT-4 is now here. I've read so many ridiculous assumptions about the model, that I decided to ask ChatGPT to summarize the transcript of yesterday's live session hosted by Greg Brockman, President and Co-Founder of OpenAI.First, let's see what Greg Brockman had to say and then I'll make 2 comments for you to think about. The links to the resources in this post are in the comment section.▶️ ChatGPT's summary of Greg Brockman's presentation:""On March 14th, Greg Brockman, President and Co-Founder of OpenAI discussed a developer demo of GPT-4 and its capabilities/limitations. The demo showcases GPT-4's ability to perform various tasks, such as summarizing articles into sentences and turning blog posts into rhyming poems. The model is steerable and can adhere to any instruction given to it. The demo also highlights the creation of a Discord bot using GPT-4 as an AI programming assistant to write code in pseudocode and break down problems into smaller pieces. The model's training cutoff is in 2021, which limits its ability to recognize new chat completion formats. Nonetheless, the model is flexible and can be applied to various problems and applications. The text also indicates that the model is highly flexible and can handle a variety of inputs, including code, language, and text, suggesting that it may be capable of processing images in some form, although the exact extent of this capability is not clear from the given information.""▶️ My 2 comments:1. GPT-4 is an incremental evolution of GPT-3.5 turbo(ChatGPT) that will have better ""steering"" flexibility and multimodal capability. It's a good step forward but not a revolution. There is still a lot of work to do such as helping OpenAI by evaluating and providing feedback.2.. DALL-E, Vit, and CLIP are already ""first generation"" multimodal transformers as shown in the image below which is an excerpt from Transformers for NLP, 2nd Edition, Chapter 15, in which I explain the theory of these models and provide notebooks.🔴 Bottom line: For those who understand the architecture of transformer models and are implementing GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4 is an incremental evolution. However, for those who have not kept up with the theory and practice of transformers, GPT-4 is a quantum leap to get up to speed. Some compensate for their lack of knowledge with fantasmagorical hype. This creates the huge gap we can see on social media between science and fiction. Ignore the hype, stick to the science, and get to work on transformers asap!#ai#science#gpt4#chatgpt",0.6918,0.4608383838383839,7 ,45,4

Der Golden Circle ist ein Konzept, das von Sinek in seinem Buch ""Start with Why"" eingeführt wurde. Es ist ein Framework, das Unternehmen dabei hilft, ihre Mission und ihr Warum (Why) zu identifizieren und zu kommunizieren.👨‍💻  Ich: Wäre die richtige Übersetzung von Why in dem Zusammenhang nicht eher Wozu oder Wofür?🤖  ChatGPT: Ja, du hast recht, die Übersetzung von ""Why"" im Zusammenhang mit dem Golden Circle kann je nach Kontext auch mit ""Wozu"" oder ""Wofür"" übersetzt werden. Im deutschen Kontext kann das Wort ""Warum"" jedoch auch passend sein, da es oft als Synonym für ""Wozu"" oder ""Wofür"" verwendet wird und sich auf den Zweck oder die Motivation hinter einer Handlung oder Entscheidung bezieht.In der Tat betont Sinek, dass das ""Why"" im Golden Circle sich auf das ""purpose"" bezieht, was in diesem Zusammenhang mit ""Zweck"" oder ""Sinn"" übersetzt werden kann. Der Fokus liegt darauf, warum ein Unternehmen, eine Person oder eine Organisation das tut, was sie tut, und nicht nur darauf, was sie tun oder wie sie es tun.👨‍💻  Ich: Naja, auch wenn es in Deutschland einfach falsch übersetzt wird, hat das Konzept eine sehr starke Wirkung und ich bin davon überzeugt, dass wir die Welt besser machen, wenn wir mehr über  unsere Überzeugungen sprechen und weniger darüber, wie wir es oder was wir machen.🤖  ChatGPT: Ja, da gebe ich dir vollkommen recht. Das Konzept des Golden Circle ist unabhängig von der Übersetzung sehr wirkungsvoll und kann dazu beitragen, dass Menschen und Organisationen ihre Überzeugungen und Werte besser verstehen und effektiver kommunizieren. Indem wir uns auf unser ""Why"" oder unseren Zweck konzentrieren, können wir uns motivieren, unsere Ziele zu erreichen und einen sinnvollen Beitrag zu leisten.👨‍💻 Ich: Wir brauchen vielleicht bald keine Freunde mehr, mit denen wir uns über solche Themen unterhalten. Und doch ist es wichtig, dass wir unserer Überzeugung treu bleiben und nicht auf alles hören, das uns irgendwer vorkaut und wir dann einfach schlucken. Wenn wir immer nach dem Warum fragen (also nach der Ursache) hängen wir in der Vergangenheit und finden Ausreden (warum -> weil versus wozu -> damit).

"Manuel Parra Palacios, MSc PMP",15-03-2023,"Ayer martes se anunció el nuevo modelo de lenguaje GPT-4 de OpenAI, un modelo de inteligencia artificial que asegura ser el más avanzado del mundo.GPT-4 tiene 15 veces más parámetros que su predecesor, GPT-3, y es capaz de completar tareas complejas de lenguaje natural con una precisión impresionante. Una de las principales innovaciones de GPT-4 es su capacidad para generar textos coherentes y convincentes a partir de solo un fragmento de texto de entrada. Además, GPT-4 puede crear texto que parece haber sido escrito por humanos, lo que lo hace muy útil para diversas aplicaciones.La capacidad de GPT-4 para entender y producir lenguaje natural se basa en un enfoque de aprendizaje automático conocido como ""aprendizaje profundo"". A través del aprendizaje profundo, GPT-4 puede analizar enormes cantidades de datos de lenguaje natural y aprender patrones en el idioma. Esto permite a GPT-4 generar texto que suena natural y coherente, incluso en contextos complejos.GPT-4 también puede generar respuestas a preguntas complejas, completar oraciones y crear resúmenes precisos de textos largos. Otra de las aplicaciones potenciales de GPT-4 es la creación de contenido para medios de comunicación y marketing. Por ejemplo, GPT-4 puede generar títulos de artículos, subtítulos y descripciones que atraen al público y aumentan la visibilidad del contenido.GPT-4 también tiene la capacidad de traducir texto de un idioma a otro con una precisión impresionante. Esto podría tener un gran impacto en la comunicación global y en la eliminación de barreras lingüísticas.Sin embargo, también hay preocupaciones sobre el potencial de GPT-4 para generar contenido engañoso o manipulado.OpenAI está trabajando en medidas para evitar el uso indebido de GPT-4 y garantizar que se utilice de manera ética y responsable.#ChatGPT#IAFuente: ""OpenAI releases GPT-4, a multimodal AI that it claims is state-of-the-art"".

Kate Xie,15-03-2023,"Can AI make better art than humans? It's an interesting questionArtificial intelligence has been infiltrating every industry and the world of arts and culture is no exception. In other words, AI art is poised to explode.AI text-to-image generators such as DALL-E or Midjourney have been creating remarkable visual artworks. ChatGPT has taken the world by the storm with its ability to answer questions, write essays, and summarize texts, among other things. AI-generated art is even being displayed at world-renowned museums.These examples show just how powerful generative AI can be and bid this pressing question: is AI about to replace human artists? It is a question worth thinking about.Seth Dobrin, IBM's first-ever Global Chief AI Officer, has an answer.AI-generated visual art already exists in various forms. There are examples of artists — such as Refik Anadol — who are the actual creators, but use artificial intelligence to augment their artworks. There are also tools like DALL-E which “are getting there,” although it's difficult to say whether their works are truly indistinguishable from humans'.Dobrin has a similar view on news articles, noting that financial news is already being automatically generated to an extent. And while he doesn't believe that AI-generated text is as engaging as a writer's would be, he explained that GPT-3 and Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate stories that journalists can use as a starting point.But when it comes to movies and novels, AI has a longer way to go. That's because “AI needs to truly learn emotion, really be able to simulate it, and invoke empathy — better than it can today,” Dobrin said. He expects five more years for novel creation, and between five to 10 years for movie production.But what's Dobrin's prediction on classical music? And does he believe that AI will merely augment humans in the creative process — or eventually replace them?You can watch the full interview to find out.#AIintelligence#AI#ChatGPT#artificialintelligence#OracleTranslation#manualtranslation#languagetranslation",0.9907,0.4346059113300492,0,0,0

Egal ob Fußballprofis wie Granit Xhaka und Xherdan Shaqiri oder Pop-Ikonen wie Dua Lipa, Bebe Rexha und Rita Ora – sie alle sorgen dafür, dass die albanischen Jugendlichen vor Stolz platzen und die ein oder andere Gesangseinlage oder sportliche Kür einlegen möchten.Aber Moment mal, es gibt noch mehr! Die jüngeren Generationen entdecken ganz neue Vorbilder, die über Sport und Musik hinausgehen. Auf dem internationalen Parkett finden sich immer mehr Männer und Frauen mit albanischen Wurzeln, die in der Welt der Wissenschaft und Technik für Aufsehen sorgen. Ein strahlendes Beispiel ist die geniale Frau hinter der Technologie von ChatGPT und Dall-EMira Murati – Der Kopf hinter ChatGPT🤖ChatGPT und Dall-E sind zwei künstliche Intelligenz-Entwicklungen aus dem Silicon Valley, die in letzter Zeit für Furore gesorgt haben. Die treibende Kraft hinter diesen beiden Projekten ist Mira Murati, eine 35-jährige Albanerin, die heute im Silicon Valley arbeitet.Murati leitet die Teams für ChatGPT und DALL-E. Schon nach zwei Monaten konnte ChatGPT stolze 100 Millionen aktive Nutzer vorweisen. Zum Vergleich: TikTok knackte diese Zahl erst nach ungefähr neun Monaten, während Instagram dafür zweieinhalb Jahre benötigte.Das in San Francisco ansässige Start-up (mit 375 Mitarbeitern) wird mittlerweile auf schwindelerregende 30 Milliarden Dollar geschätzt. Bei Google sorgte dieser Trend für Schweißperlen – aus Furcht um das eigene Suchmaschinengeschäft.Mira Muratis beeindruckender Werdegang und ihre Arbeit bei OpenAI sind ein Zeichen für ihr Talent und ihre Leidenschaft für Technologie und künstliche Intelligenz. Die Erfolge von ChatGPT und Dall-E zeigen, dass sie noch viel bewegen kann und eine wichtige Stimme in der Tech-Welt ist und ein Vorbild für viele Albanerinnen und Albaner.#inspiration#tech#chatgpt##talent#openai#ki#ai",-0.9953,0.0,3 ,27,0
Florian Groening,15-03-2023,"Viele große Unternehmen sind längst „in der Cloud“. Für viele kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMUs) stellt sich jedoch nach wie vor die Frage: Macht das für mich Sinn?Die Antwort kann man ausnahmsweise mal sehr klar formulieren: Ja!Warum genau sollte man denn so unbedingt „in die Cloud“? In Gesprächen mit KMUs höre ich häufig eine aus meiner Sicht falsche Motivation/Hoffnung: Um Geld zu sparen! Das ist aber in den meisten Fällen gar nicht so gegeben – zumindest nicht kurzfristig.Was hingegen aber unbedingt für die Cloud spricht:🚨Sicherheit! Sehr viele Unternehmen – auch die KMUs - sind schon Opfer von Cyber Angriffen geworden, teilweise mit dramatischen Folgen bis hin zur Insolvenz. Experten gehen davon aus, dass im Laufe der Zeit jedes (!) Unternehmen Opfer wird. Eine Auslagerung von kritischen Geschäftsprozessen in die Cloud erhöht signifikant die Chancen, auch bei Cyberangriffen „betriebsbereit“ zu bleiben bzw. schnell wieder zu werden. Früher hatte man eher Bedenken, ob „meine Daten“ in der Cloud sicher seien – heute muss man anerkennen, dass tausende von Sicherheitsexperten bei Cloudanbietern ihr Kerngeschäft besser absichern können, als ein KMU dies jemals mit seinen Ressourcen tun könnte!📱Mobilität und Flexibilität! Die Verlagerung möglichst vieler Geschäftsprozesse und Daten in die Cloud ermöglich erst, dass man flexibel von überall auf der Welt (oder auch nur im Außendienst 250km entfernt) „wie im Büro“ sicher arbeiten kann. Und manchmal sogar besser als vorher (z.B. gleichzeitig im selben Dokument). Kombiniert mit Kommunikationslösungen, wie z.B. MS TEAMs, kann man zudem auch mit den Kunden und seinen Teams „unterwegs“ nahtlos im Kontakt bleiben.Somit entsteht einerseits ein ganz anderes Flexibilitätsniveau, um auch mit besonderen Situationen umzugehen (à la: „Alle ins Homeoffice, wir haben eine Pandemie“). Es wächst vor allem aber auch die Attraktivität des Unternehmens für Arbeitnehmer - und um die muss in den nächsten Jahren immer härter „gekämpft“ werden!🚀 Weil man es heute endlich kann! Viele Standardprozesse des Büroalltags lassen sich inzwischen über Standard-Cloud-Lösungen / Software as a Servcie SaaS (wie z.B. Microsoft 365/Azure oder Google) effizient auslagern, sodass man „auf Augenhöhe“ mit Konzernen operieren kann, ohne eine eigene IT-Abteilung zu unterhalten.Insofern kann man zusammenfassend festhalten: wenn man einen Cyber Angriff schneller und ohne Lösegeldzahlungen überstanden hat, weil man schon in der Cloud war, hat man am Ende doch sehr viel Geld gespart.Natürlich muss ein „Umzug in die Cloud“ gut geplant sein, von der technischen Umsetzung bis hin zur Anpassung der Unternehmenskultur. the future of | unterstützt hier gerne und ganzheitlich!Was denkt Ihr, macht der Umzug in die Cloud Sinn?#thefutureof#kmu#cloud#saas#cybersecurity#mobileworking#workcation(Bildquelle: durch Dall-E gerendert)",-0.9952,0.5625,0,9,1

Alexandros Mylopoulos,15-03-2023,"AI is not new. But in the last 3 months, with the widespread usage of GPT, it reached the ultimate awareness level: My parents are talking about it 😆A new skill is being developed for professionals across industries. Prompt engineering, or the art & science of asking the right questions to optimize the outputs of ChatGPT, will soon be an essential prerequisite for efficient working. I expect job ads to be explicitly asking for advanced prompt engineering skills, already this year. By the end of next year, using AI will be as widespread as Googling is today. Workers who are late in learning how to interact with AI will be left behind inevitably, as they will be lacking this multiplier effect.AI is at the heart of what we do at Baresquare. Our platform produces insights in natural language, similar to the logic of generative AI tools. The wisdom of AI perfectly complements our own expertise in digital analytics, derived from a 15-year experience. We developed a chatbot over 5 years ago, in 2017. Our CEO has delivered a TEDx talk for ethics in AI. Naturally, we rushed to complete this powerful training on GPT & AI tools.

Shoukat Hussain,15-03-2023,"Microsoft laid off an entire team dedicated to guiding AI innovation that leads to ethical, responsible and sustainable outcomes. The cutting of the ethics and society team, as reported by Platformer, is part of a recent spate of layoffs that affected 10,000 employees across the company.The elimination of the team comes as Microsoft invests billions more dollars into its partnership with OpenAI, the startup behind art- and text-generating AI systems like ChatGPT and DALL-E 2, and revamps its Bing search engine and Edge web browser to be powered by a new, next-generation large language model that is “more powerful than ChatGPT and customized specifically for search.”The move calls into question Microsoft’s commitment to ensuring its product design and AI principles are closely intertwined at a time when the company is making its controversial AI tools available to the mainstream.Microsoft still maintains its Office of Responsible AI (ORA), which sets rules for responsible AI through governance and public policy work. But employees told Platformer that the ethics and society team was responsible for ensuring Microsoft’s responsible AI principles are actually reflected in the design of products that ship. The team had been recently working to identify risks posed by Microsoft’s integration of OpenAI’s technology across its suite of products.The ethics and society team wasn’t very large — only about seven people remained after a reorganization in October. Sources who spoke with Platformer said pressure from the chief technology officer Kevin Scott and CEO Satya Nadella was mounting to get the most recent OpenAI models, as well as next iterations, into customers’ hands as quickly as possible.Last year, the reorganization saw most of the ethics and society team transferred to other teams. On March 6, John Montgomery, corporate vice president of AI, told the remaining members that they’d be eliminated after all. Members of the team told Platformer they believed they were let go because Microsoft had become more focused on getting its AI products shipped before the competition, and was less concerned with long-term, socially responsible thinking.Teams like Microsoft’s ethics and society department often pull the reins on big tech organizations by pointing out potential societal consequences or legal ramifications. Microsoft perhaps didn’t want to hear “No,” anymore as it became hell bent on taking market share away from Google’s search engine. The company said every 1% of market share it could pry from Google would result in $2 billion in annual revenue.V-ART SERVICES PVT LTDVector ArtRohit JaiswalKafil Baloch",0.9754,0.4735312306740879,0,1,0

Another major goal, he said, is to “create policies and guardrails for agencies that allow them to be able to use those tools responsibly.”New York City for years has used algorithms to match students with public schools, to power police technologies like gunshot detection tools, and even to target homelessness prevention resources. In many instances, they have learned to proceed with caution. There are several ethical considerations raised by the application of AI, including#privacyconcerns and questions of bias that can have disproportionate impacts on people of color or women when applied to criminal justice or hiring decisions.The position of AI director isn’t an entirely new one for New York. In 2019, under then-Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, New York City hired Neal Parikh, a start-up founder who got his PhD in machine learning from Stanford University, to run artificial intelligence strategy, a role that was then under the Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer.“The idea was, essentially, we can't really write these AI policies governing the city's own use of this without understanding what is even out there,” Parikh recalled.His main priority then was shaping New York City’s#AIstrategy, with a document that laid out the city’s philosophy of#digitalrightsand the areas of opportunity for using artificial intelligence and machine learning within city government. Doing this work within the structure of government was sometimes challenging, he said.“The diversity of tasks is a great challenge in doing something like AI policy, because it's not a one-size-fits-all thing. It's often very context-based,” said Parikh. “It's a much harder job than being an AI ethics researcher, I'll tell you that.”Prior AI-focused initiatives, like a task force convened in 2017 to shape algorithmic policy, have run into...",0.9923,0.46993207941483794,2 ,1,0

James Craddock,15-03-2023,"Morning! Over the last couple of months, I've been talking a lot about#AIand#ChatGPT. Last night there was a major#updatemoving from GPT 3.5 to GPT 4.ChatGPT 4 is available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers at $20 per month and is currently restricted to 100 messages in a 4-hour period.ChatGPT 4 will beable to:✔Understand images - eg: writing captions for images or interpreting them and picking out ingredients and suggesting recipes.✔It is capable of handling up to 25,000 words in a single request - about 6 times that of the previous version.✔It has advanced reasoning capabilities✔It's safer, less likely to respond with disallowed content and is more likely to produce factual responses than its predecessor.So I thought I'd interview ChatGPT 4 and ask it what the differences are between ChatGPT 3.5 vs 4.It had many ideas, but they were all hypothetical as it didn't realise that the upgrade had taken place and it was now running on a new version....However, I did get an insight as to how it wanted to be seen by the LinkedIn community. I asked it:❓Please write me instructions for Dall-E-2 to draw me a picture to go with your LinkedIn interview that you feel best represents you.Its response: 🗣 ""Create an illustration featuring a friendly and professional AI language model, ChatGPT, being interviewed for a LinkedIn post. The scene should depict a virtual environment with ChatGPT represented as an advanced, sleek, and modern chatbot or hologram. Include a laptop or computer screen displaying the ongoing interview conversation""Dall-E-2 is an AI image generation tool 📷 created by#OpenAithe company behind ChatGPT - the image used on this post was generated by Dall-E-2 using the text prompt above. So one could say, this is how ChatGPT sees itself...But when questioned, ChatGPT 4 says: 📢 ""As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or self-perception in the way humans do. My purpose is to assist users with their questions and provide information based on the data I've been trained on.""My conclusion, ChatGPT 4 is not the best interview subject or indeed an expert on what the new version of this ground-breaking AI is capable of.I guess I'm just going to have to start using it to see what all the fuss is about. But don't worry I will share my findings.Have you started to use ChatGPT yet?

Michael Sean O'Brien,15-03-2023,"Generative AI (Dall-E, Chat-GPT, etc) is very important, interesting, and impressive. As Artificial Intelligence, however, it is also extremely limited and—worse—impossible to predict in its behavior. It *mimics* intelligence in specific (and undoubtedly useful) situations, but it cannot reason, and it has no capability for abstraction. It cannot be relied upon to solve even simple logic puzzles and “story problems”. It cannot solve problems at all except where it has many many examples to hand of similar problems laid it out in exhaustive imagery or text, and even then it regularly gets basic things wrong. The problem is not that its manner of learning is not yet perfected. The problem is that it *only* learns. It neither reasons nor abstracts learning to create or apply understanding. And the authors of these technologies are not by and large working to add these capabilities to their creations. They have their hammer — deep learning — and they will find their nails. We need more tools in our toolbox, if we are to make AI not just more proficient, but more reliable, governable, and most of all safe.

Rajesh Anandan,15-03-2023,"Diversity is not an advantage. Sometimes.Sometimes diversity can be irrelevant. Sometimes it can be a disadvantage. There are a couple important caveats to any claim that diversity is a competitive advantage. It depends on the context. It depends on the timeframe.In some contexts, diversity can be counter productive. Thorough preparation, tight coordination and speed of execution might be all that matters. No one would argue that diversity is the recipe for success on a 4X100 relay team.In the short term, diversity can be a distraction. It takes deliberate effort over time to create the conditions for a diverse team to thrive, and there are no quick wins. For organizations in crisis, diversity can seem like a luxury they can’t afford. Doubling down on the strengths they already have and narrowing their focus to the tactics they already know can seem like the only way out. No one would push for diversity as a key business priority in the middle of a corporate turnaround.But most businesses aren’t like track teams, and most winning business strategies are built on long term bets that require patient, sustained execution. Any organization that expects to thrive in the increasingly complex and ever changing world we live in today, needs to be able to bring together team members who are different and create an environment that can harness those differences as an asset.Cognitive diversity is the new competitive advantage.

Rajesh Anandan,15-03-2023,"A teacher brings a glass to class. They also bring rocks, pebbles and sand. They want to teach their class about focusing on the most important things first, and ask the students how they would fill the glass. The “right” answer being to start with the big rocks, which leaves space for the pebbles and sand, vs filling the glass up with sand and pebbles first, which won’t leave space for the big rocks.You've probably heard this story before, and the moral of the story is that if only we knew how to prioritize, we can get to all the important things we need to do. That’s neat, but of course, the real challenge in the real world is that there are far too many important things. Too many big rocks to fit into one glass.Finitude is the idea that life and everything we know/do/experience has limits and bounds. Which means the trick is not just to start with the big rocks (which we should do anyway), but to accept that there are many big rocks that won’t fit in our glass. And double bonus if we're able to forgive ourselves when that happens.Want to squeeze in one more critical feature into the next release. Won’t happen.Want to read that really important book this week. Unlikely.Want to spend just one more hour with the love of your life during review season/budget season/campaign season. If only.A better story might be that a teacher walks into class with a glass and a dozen big rocks. No two look alike, and they are each uniquely beautiful, some may be precious, others may be worthless, and there’s no way to tell the difference. Only a few of those rocks will fit into the glass. The teacher asks the students to decide which rocks to put in the glass, and everyone stresses out because there is no “right” answer.You’re probably already focusing on the most important things. Try to forgive yourself the next time you drop one.#timemanagement#life#bekind#dothework",0.9874,0.5098356009070295,1 ,9,0

The output generated by Mid Journey for the architecture visualization prompt could be a realistic 3D model of a building with intricate details such as textures, lighting, and shadows. Mid Journey's output is particularly impressive when it comes to generating complex structures with many layers and details.DALL-E 2: This tool is a natural language processing (NLP) model that can generate images based on textual prompts. For the architecture visualization prompt, DALL-E 2 could generate a wide variety of images, ranging from abstract representations of buildings to more realistic depictions. DALL-E 2's output tends to be more creative and imaginative, as it can generate images that are not necessarily based on realistic architecture.NightCafe: This tool is an AI-based image generator that can create unique and realistic images based on textual prompts.

MIT Machine Intelligence for Manufacturing and Operations,15-03-2023,"It’s impossible to overstate the excitement that currently surrounds the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From generative AI breakthroughs like ChatGPT and DALL-E to advancements in autonomy, enthusiasm about machine intelligence is spreading beyond computer science circles and entering the mainstream market, prompting industry leaders to ask how this technology can be useful to them. Current trends show that AI could augment a workforce, speed up decision-making, improve pipelines, and automate mundane tasks. But there are complex considerations when weighing AI solutions such as sustainability concerns, cost, and limitations. AI adopters also want to be sure that they’re staying up to date with the latest innovations, maximizing the impact of use cases and remaining competitive as this evolving field continues to change.One way to see beyond the horizon in machine intelligence is to understand what’s happening at research institutions like MIT. This year’s AI – Accelerate Impact: MIT MIMO Symposium—a student-led annual event that brings together industry leaders and members of the MIT community to discuss how machine learning is transforming manufacturing and operations—will focus on the current impact of AI and how it can be accelerated going forward.On May 9th, join both industry and academic speakers as they discuss how machine intelligence can increase efficiency, empower sustainability, and be applied to manufacturing and operations.The 2023 Symposium is hosted by MIT MIMO in collaboration withMIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)",0.9912,0.5427350427350427,0,5,1

Giordano B Ferreira,15-03-2023,"Você acha que uma pessoa que não saiba nada de programação conseguiria criar um jogo do zero com o auxílio do GPT4?Hoje aOpenAIrealizou o lançamento do GPT4, a nova versão do seu LLM. A demo realizada pelo presidente da OpenAI, Greg Brockman, mostrou a grande capacidade do modelo. Como já esperado, o modelo é multimodal, ou seja, receberá tanto texto quanto imagens como input e apresentará textos como output. Isso cria novos casos de uso como detalhamento de imagens, ou mesmo criação de códigos à partir de uma foto de um desenho realizado em uma folha de papel.Ainda não é possível enviar imagens para a versão pública do modelo, mas eles já disponibilizaram a interface de chat com a versão nova do modelo e eu pude testar. E, respondendo a pergunta lá do início, sim, foi possível criar um clone funcional de flappy bird em menos de 20 minutos.O que eu fiz? Pedi para o GPT4 criar um clone de flappy birds em javascript mostrando todos os arquivos necessários para que o jogo funcione. A resposta inicial foi que não seria possível apresentar o código de todo o jogo, mas já mostrou os primeiros códigos. Ao final da resposta, o modelo informou o que faltava para ter um código funcional (obstáculos, detecção de colisão, pontuação e game over). Depois disso, foi só realizar as perguntas sobre cada um dos pontos e atualizar o código.O mais legal é que todo o código gerado tem uma explicação no final. Uma ótima forma de aprender a programar.Depois disso, criei uma conta noReplituma IDE colaborativa que roda diretamente no browser. Colei o código gerado pelo GPT4. Criei um ícone no DALL-E. Cliquei em publicar e pronto. Estava com o jogo rodando no browser.Claro, para que o jogo ficasse divertido, muitas coisas ainda seriam necessárias. Mas, acredito que seria possível continuar utilizando o GPT4 para incrementar a jogabilidade.

James Creech,15-03-2023,"ChatGPT-4 has arrived. And it's got more horsepower than Vin Diesel during a bank heist. 🏎️💨So what makes this new version better than ChatGPT-3?➊ GPT-4 can understand images. 🧑‍🎨That's right, art history class just got a lot easier.The feature is a research only preview for now, but essentially ChatGPT can accept photos, diagrams, and screenshots as prompts.Why write social media captions anymore when ChatGPT can do it for you?Not only will this enable better feedback loops for generative AI tools like DALL-E, it's a huge accessibility milestone. ChatGPT can now ""read images"" to help the blind and visually impaired.➋ GPT-4 is more accurate. 🎯The new model has broader general knowledge and increased problem solving abilities that produce 40% more accurate results than GPT-3.Which is good because if I want someone to mansplain everything on the Internet to me, I at least want the answers to be correct.➌ GPT-4 is safer. 🦺Just like Liam Neeson, the new model has a very particular set of skills that make it harder to trick or request disallowed content.➍ GPT-4 is multilingual. 🌐I guess AI spent the last 6 months studying abroad because ChatGPT now has high accuracy in 26 languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Russian.➎ GPT-4 is better at biology than you. 🔬The new model scored in the 99th percentile of the Biology Olympiad (basically the nerd olympics).Robots don't even have biology, and now they're better than us humans at that too!?What are you most excited about for ChatGPT-4?#AI#technology#chatgpt#chatgpt4#openai",0.9913,0.45284533648170017,17 ,50,5

Lynn Twiss,15-03-2023,"""Sorry, but our interview was with Lynn Twiss, however you sound like a man?"" - ""At your age and experience level, I'm sure you understand it's difficult to find positions. Have you considered early retirement?""My Saturday Accountability post came and went this week as I spent the day drinking Guinness and contemplating these two statements from two separate interviews from Thursday.My whole life I have been mistaken for a woman over email. An example of this: I worked as a strategist at an agency in Portland, which had offices in New York. I would send strategy deck to the NY Strategy team for review, and their feedback redlines would be intense with very combative language. It was frustrating, and I spent a measure of effort and time providing well researched support rationales aligning with company goals. No matter how prepared I was, they always tore the work apart and sent back conflicting strategy that made no sense and wouldn't achieve the client's goals.Then they finally met me in person.""When is this Lynn woman going to get here?"" the Sr. Head of Strategy stated with an afternoon cocktail in hand. ""Ummm... I'm Lynn, standing right here."" The whole group went silent as they looked me up and down. ""Wait, you're a man?""After this interaction, their responses to my strategy decks were generally no feedback or simple ""Looks good.""Shocking? Not for women who deal with this their whole careers.Now, I'm dealing with the inverse. A recruiter this week called me (they were in the HR function) and asked to speak with ""Lynn."" ""That's me,"" I replied. ""That can't be; you sound like a man?"" I explained that I had checked the ""Male"" box in the gender question part of the application process. Within a few sentences, she excused herself from the call ""Sorry, I forgot something. I'll need to call you back.""That call never came.I have encountered the second comment more frequently as I turned 50. Ageism has been a problem for me in the past 5-8 years, particularly in marketing where anyone over 40 years-of-age is deemed either too expensive on the FTE budget or not relevant to the target audience for messaging and creative development. It's frustrating, but I am working on adapting to the situation.Which Lynn would you consider hiring?Image is courtesy DALL-E, where I input my LinkedIn photo and asked the AI to draw two genders for myself.

Today, three major players announced the release of their language model: Anthropic's#Claude, Googles#palmAPI, and OpenAI's#gpt4And it was only yesterday that Stanford released an open-source version.After watching the press release and skimming the paper, GPT-4 seems to be even more impressive than ChatGPT. It is multimodal (meaning it can understand images), can create a website from a design written on a napkin, understands more languages than ever, and could pass the entry exam for a prestigious University.But the biggest change to me has to be OpenAI's secrecy about its implementation. Over the last three years, we saw open-source initiatives being surprisingly fast at replicating the works of large tech companies, making the technology accessible to everyone. First,#GPT-3 was replicated, then Dall-E, and yesterday#InstructGPT. It seems less likely that GPT-4 will have a similar fate, unfortunately.

Edo Bar-Gil,15-03-2023,"A few AI-based tools that can change your life (IMHO 😊) -When ChatGPT was released, it quickly became something that people couldn’t stop talking about (yours truly is one of those people 😊).However, it’s not the only tool that is free (or cheap) and that can really change your life / work routine and boost your productivity.Below is a list of a few AI-based tools that I find very useful (on some of which I have already wrote about):·  Wordtune (https://www.wordtune.com/) – Wordtune is the ultimate AI writing tool that rewrites and rephrases your writing. Think of it as your personal assistant in drafting your thoughts in words.·  Canva’s Magic Write (https://lnkd.in/d-3kNp-e) - Simply type in a prompt describing what you’re looking to create and then the AI kickstarts a first draft to best suit your vision. It’s useful for drafting strategy documents, meeting agendas, letters etc.·  Eleven Labs (beta) (https://lnkd.in/dFb6Ueig) – an audio tool that generates top-quality spoken audio in any voice and style. It can be used for storytelling, articles or newsletters to be read, and for audiobooks.·  Midjourney (https://lnkd.in/dFb6Ueig) – Similar to Dall-E 2, this tool allows to create graphics and art via text inputs. All you need to do is tell it exactly what you need for an image and it creates it for you within seconds.·  Papercup (https://www.papercup.com/) – amazing AI based translation tool for videos. You can simply translate any video, which means that you can reach millions of users from different countries with over 70 languages available.·  Rationale (https://rationale.jina.ai/) – think of it as your strategy top confidential partner. The tool is meant to assist in making tough decisions. All you have to do is enter a pending decision and it will list pros and cons or generate a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis to help you weigh your options.·  OtterPilot (https://otter.ai/home) - automated meeting summaries, slides capture and meeting notes, that streamline the meeting process and enable to skip unnecessary meetings.As always, I would be happy to get any comments / feedback. Please lmk if you were / weren’t aware of some of these tools and which of them changed your life 😊.",0.9887,0.5072380952380953,21 ,49,1

Pavel Krishchuk,15-03-2023,"PLEASE OUTLINE THE FONTSOnce in the quirky town of Typography, a designer named Dolly Doodle was famous for her eccentric fashion and love for fonts. Each day, she wore outfits inspired by different fonts, making her a walking, talking embodiment of a diverse font library.Dolly's favorite pastime was creating posters for imaginary events using her extensive font collection. One day, she decided to host a real event – the First Annual Font Festival! She planned a day full of font-themed games, food, and fashion for font fanatics to share their passion.While designing the promotional posters, Dolly discovered a mysterious font called ""Fontasia,"" which changed its appearance every time it was used. Intrigued, she used Fontasia on her posters, and they became the most eye-catching designs she had ever made.Word spread quickly about the Font Festival, and font enthusiasts from far and wide RSVP'd. Dolly prepared tirelessly for the big day, and when it finally arrived, the town of Typography was buzzing with excitement.Everyone dressed in outfits inspired by their favorite fonts, and the highlight of the event was the Fontasia Fashion Show. As Dolly took center stage, her Fontasia-inspired dress shimmered under the spotlight. As she danced, the font transformed into an array of styles and colors, leaving everyone in awe.Suddenly, Fontasia went rogue! The font began to change uncontrollably, growing larger and more erratic with each transformation. Soon, the entire town was engulfed in a chaotic jumble of letters and styles. Arial acrobats became entangled in serifs, and the Times New Roman toga party was trapped in a labyrinth of text.Desperate to save the day, Dolly climbed to the top of the tallest building in Typography and pleaded with Fontasia. ""Please, Fontasia, you are a beautiful and unique font, but we need order and harmony to coexist. Please outline the fonts and help us bring peace back to our town!""With a flash, Fontasia understood the importance of balance and outlined itself, settling into a stable and elegant style. The town returned to normal, and the First Annual Font Festival became the most memorable event in Typography's history. From then on, whenever Dolly designed a new poster, she remembered to say, ""Please outline the fonts!""(story generated with ChatGPT, pic generated by DALL-E 2)#chatGPT#ai#artificialintelligence#dalle2",0.9947,0.5980614973262031,0,7,0

Ola Andersson,15-03-2023,"And there it is. I förra veckan fick vi veta att Open AI skulle släppa GPT-4 - alltså version 4 av den teknik som ChatGPT är baserad på - och nu har den landat.Jag börjar på ungefär samma sätt som när jag skrev om förhandsinfon förra veckan: det handlar om version 4 av GPT - inte version 4 av ChatGPT. Det är alltså den språkmodell som ChatGPT använder som nu har uppdaterats.Den stora nyheten i beskedet förra veckan var att GPT-4 skulle hantera multimodala kommandon. GPT-4 kan alltså hantera mer än bara textkommandon. Det är alltså ungefär som Googles multisök som släpptes förra året: AI:n kan kan förstå både text och bild. Vilket alltså skulle kunna innebära, även här en Google-parallell, att man kan ladda upp en bild på exempel på vad man vill att AI:n ska skapa och komplettera med textinstruktion.Det leder förstås till frågan om AI:n i och med detta också skulle kunna spotta ur sig svar i flera format. Open AI står ju exempelvis även bakom bildskapar-AI:n DALL-E. Men här är svaret nej. GPT-4 kan förstå bilder som ”kommandon”, men den kommer fortfarande bara svara med text.Och precis som Open AI-VD:n konstaterade när han avfärdade den där virala bilden med jämförelsen mellan GPT-3 och GPT-4 som ”bullshit” (för att förtydliga: den var alltså fejk) så handlar det om en inkrementell förbättring. En från version 3.5 till version 4. GPT bli bättre, snabbare och ännu lite smartare - men det kommer inte att bli någon himlastormande skillnad för slutanvändaren. Enligt Open AI själva.Men hur blir det då med ChatGPT? Jodå, den får också GPT-4. Så den kommer att bli lite vassare. Kommer även till ChatGPT:s API (det senare har en väntelista). Vi kan väl anta att de som betalar för ChatGPT får snabbare tillgång.Det mest intressanta i nyheten är beskedet att Open AI ”för att förbereda bildinmatningskapaciteten för en bredare utrullning kommer att samarbeta med en enda partner initialt”. Frågan är alltså vilken tjänst eller vilket företag som kommer att stå för bildigenkänningsskillsen. Microsoft känns väl lite som en… lågoddsare.Men frågan är hur Open AI tänker sig att flera partners ska fungera här? Nu när jag tänker efter så känns det som att det kanske helt enkelt handlar om vilken molnleverantör som ska sköta de tunga lyften.https://buff.ly/3mPIiU0#digitalaspaningar#chatgpt#openai#ai",0.0,0.5,2 ,17,0

Aitor Porcel Laburu,14-03-2023,"¿La industria de la construcción se está quedando atrás en la revolución de la inteligencia artificial?A medida que la ciencia de datos, la inteligencia artificial y el ""big data"" se vuelven más omnipresentes en diversos campos, uno podría preguntarse si la industria de la construcción, con sus prácticas tradicionales, está adoptando estas nuevas tecnologías lo suficientemente rápido. Aunque se habla de cómo la inteligencia artificial va a transformar la construcción, hay pocos ejemplos concretos de su implementación en esta milenaria industria. ¿Será que un perro viejo no aprende trucos nuevos?En este post, vamos a compartir algunos casos reales de la aplicación de la ciencia de datos a la construcción. Estos ejemplos ilustran cómo se están utilizando modelos de machine learning para mejorar algunos aspectos en la industria de la construcción.Por ejemplo, DALL-E 2 y Midjourney son herramientas de inteligencia artificial que pueden utilizarse para ayudar a arquitectos a crear los primeros bocetos de los edificios:https://lnkd.in/d3e_pE5GPor otro lado, ARCHITEChTURES es una plataforma que utiliza IA para el diseño asistido de edificios residenciales:https://lnkd.in/dU_fn42vEn el rubro de la ingeniería, es posible utilizar modelos de machine learning para predecir el tráfico aéreo:https://lnkd.in/detXzMhsO para detectar fallas de pavimentos en base a fotografías:https://lnkd.in/dSE7QURsyhttps://lnkd.in/d_9JJHdCTambién puede utilizarse para identificar sectores de carretera que necesitarán mantenimiento:https://lnkd.in/dvTf_jwUEn el campo de la energía, es posible utilizar modelos de machine learning para predecir el consumo de electricidad y así optimizar el uso de energía renovable:https://lnkd.in/dtY5GTfGEn este notebook, el autor intenta estimar el confort térmico de las personas utilizando un modelo de clasificación:https://lnkd.in/dNtHbK3YEn resumen, si bien todavía la industria de la construcción no está utilizando de manera generalizada IA, lentamente aparecen algunos intentos de sumar a la ciencia de datos a la misma como pudimos ver en los ejemplos anteriores.#InteligenciaArtificial#Construcción#Arquitectura",-0.5803,0.82,0,9,0

Swapnil Amin,14-03-2023,"Hey there, tech enthusiasts, have you heard the news? Brace yourselves because the release of GPT-4 is just around the corner, and it's about to change the game in a big way!Now, some people may argue that training on more parameters doesn't necessarily make LLMs better. But hold on, because there's one thing that's got everyone in the tech world buzzing with excitement: multimodal models.According to Microsoft's Germany CTO Andreas Braun, GPT-4 is going to introduce multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities, such as videos. And that, my friends, is a massive unlock for the system.Let's break it down. Firstly, GPT-4 is going to be able to READ images, people! Not just generate them like Dall-E, the first generative AI tool that had everyone hyped last year. This represents a massive leap forward for GPT-4, making it an ""everything"" AI. Just imagine asking it to OCR an image or decipher the attitude of a painted face. And how about this for a transform prompt: ""age this person 10 years."" Mind-blowing, right?But wait, there's more! GPT-4 is also expected to have voice interaction as another modality. Move over Alexa and Siri, because GPT-4 is coming for the throne. And unlike those other virtual assistants, you'll be able to ask GPT-4 to write a song or transcribe a podcast.But that's not all, folks. GPT-4 is going to be able to read videos as input and build them as output. Yes, you read that right. An entire show made in GPT-4? It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. And YouTubers, get ready to quickly edit your videos with the help of GPT-4.Now, here's the kicker. GPT-3.5 has already passed the Turing test, Lovelace test, and all sorts of other AI criteria. Who knows how powerful GPT-5 or even GPT-10 will be? The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see where this technology takes us next.So get ready, tech enthusiasts, because GPT-4 is going to change the game in a big way. The days of AI being limited to just text are over. With GPT-4, it's not just the writers that will be affected - tons of visual and audio jobs are going to be impacted too.#technology#chatgpt4#chatgpt#chatgptai",0.9868,0.4903481822836661,0,0,0

En este sentido, la consultoría en cambio climático y sostenibilidad se presenta como una herramienta crucial para garantizar un futuro más seguro y sostenible para todos.En este contexto, es fundamental entender y reducir la huella de carbono y la huella hídrica de las organizaciones y empresas. Estos indicadores nos permiten evaluar la cantidad de emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero y el uso de agua en nuestras actividades, lo que a su vez nos permite identificar áreas de mejora y optimización.Además, el análisis de ciclo de vida es otra herramienta importante para evaluar la sostenibilidad de los productos y procesos, desde la extracción de materias primas hasta el final de la vida útil del producto. Esto nos permite evaluar y comparar alternativas y tomar decisiones más sostenibles y responsables.Finalmente, el reporte de información no financiera es una herramienta clave para comunicar nuestras acciones y resultados en materia de sostenibilidad a los diferentes grupos de interés. En un contexto en el que la sostenibilidad es cada vez más importante para clientes, inversores y la sociedad en general, contar con un reporte de información no financiera sólido y transparente se presenta como una ventaja competitiva.En resumen, la consultoría en cambio climático y sostenibilidad es una inversión estratégica para cualquier organización comprometida con un futuro más sostenible.

Brian Yam,14-03-2023,"Want to integrate OpenAI into your own product?It's hard not to get excited and hop on the bandwagon due to FOMO with the recent AI launches by HubSpot, Notion, Slack, and other leading SaaS companies.But is it the right move? I think every company that is considering an OpenAI integration need to think through these 3 questions.1. Is it a distraction to your roadmap?It's easy to build a cool OpenAI integration that gets your users excited, but will it actually deliver value? Unless you can ship it in a day or two with a tool likeParagon, you probably don't want to dedicate weeks of product and engineering resources on the integration until you've gone through through proper discovery.2. How will you train the model?Chatgpt is fun to play with out of the box, but its generalized nature means that its capacity to provide meaningful value is limited. Without appropriate training on your product specific context, it will be a gimmick at best. Think about what data you need to train the model on before you release it out into the public.3. How will you offset the costs?OpenAI API requests are not cheap. For text based responses you're paying per group of characters (tokens), for DALL-E you're paying per image, and for Whisper you're paying per minute of speech. If you release your integration out in the wild for free and users start playing nonstop with different prompts, your OpenAI invoice is not going to be fun to pay off.While answering the first two questions is extremely contextual and specific to your situation, the third problem of costs is universal.Thats why I'll be sharing strategic and tactical advice in my next post that will help you address the issue of OpenAI API costs.In the meantime, if you do have an OpenAI integration idea for your product, please share it below! I'm always fascinated by new, innovative use cases.And if it's interesting enough, perhaps we can build an MVP of it under an hour with Paragon's new pre-built OpenAI integration.#ai#openai#integrations",0.9949,0.4574544142725961,5 ,31,1

Es gibt keine Automatisierungstechnik. Es kann Unterstützungs- oder Warnsysteme wie Stabilitätskontrolle und Totwinkelwarnung umfassen. Die meisten Autos auf den Straßen sind heute Level Zero.🅻🅴🆅🅴🅻 1: FahrerassistenzDer Fahrer wird von einem Unterstützungssystem wie Abstandsregeltempomat oder Spurfolgeassistent unterstützt, muss aber jederzeit bereit sein, die Kontrolle zu übernehmen.🅻🅴🆅🅴🅻 2: TeilfahrautomatisierungDer Fahrer muss immer noch wachsam sein, aber das Fahrzeug kann mithilfe von Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) bereits mehrere Funktionen wie Bremsen, Beschleunigen und Lenken übernehmen. Die Tesla Autopilot-Funktion fällt unter Stufe zwei.🅻🅴🆅🅴🅻 3: Bedingte FahrautomatisierungNach diesem Zeitpunkt gelten Sie nicht mehr als „fahrend“ – auch wenn Sie noch auf dem Fahrersitz sitzen. Mittels künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) übernimmt das Fahrzeug alle Fahraufgaben. Ein Fahrer muss im Notfall oder bei einem Systemausfall noch anwesend sein. Der Drive Pilot von Mercedes Benz (erhältlich für S-Klasse und EQS) und das Sensing Elite System von Honda sind weltweit die einzigen Systeme, die diesen Meilenstein erreicht haben.🅻🅴🆅🅴🅻 4: Hohe FahrautomatisierungIn dieser Stufe verlieren Sie ihr Lenkrad und die Pedale. Ein Fahrzeug der Stufe vier ist völlig autonom, aber durch die Geschwindigkeit oder ein bestimmtes geografisches Gebiet begrenzt. Bei einem Systemausfall oder Notfall kann das Fahrzeug abbremsen, anhalten und selbstständig anhalten. Ein fahrerloses Taxi oder öffentliche Verkehrsmittel wären eine wahrscheinliche Anwendung auf dieser Ebene.🅻🅴🆅🅴🅻 5: Vollständige FahrautomatisierungDas ist der „Heilige Gral“ der automatisierten Fahrzeuge. Auf dieser Ebene sind Menschen „völlig überflüssig“ und müssen nur das Ziel festlegen und sich zurücklehnen und die Fahrt genießen. Das Fahrzeug kann in jeder Situation und unter allen Bedingungen fahren und ist nicht auf einen bestimmten Ort oder eine bestimmte Geschwindigkeit beschränkt.Mittlerweile haben Unternehmen und Zulieferer autonomer Fahrzeuge rund 75 Milliarden US-Dollar für die Entwicklung selbst fahrender Technologien ausgegeben – doch leider können keine nennenswerten Einnahmen für angedachte Robocar-Dienste erreicht werden.Daher sind diese Aktien heuer bereits um jeweils 80% gefallen.Aurora Innovationhttps://aurora.techTuSimplehttps://www.tusimple.com,Embark Technologyhttps://embarktrucks.comMobileyehttps://www.mobileye.com#technology#innovation#science#KI#kuenstlicheintelligenz#AI#artificialintelligenceMartin Steininger",-0.9922,0.6,0,3,0
Nit Patel,14-03-2023,"Exciting news in the world of autonomous vehicles!  Did you know that there are six levels of autonomy for self-driving cars? 🤔✔ Level 0: No automationThe driver is in full control of the vehicle, with no assistance from any automated systems.✔Level 1: Driver assistanceThis level of automation provides some driver assistance, such as cruise control, lane departure warnings, and automatic braking. However, the driver is still responsible for controlling the vehicle.✔Level 2: Partial automationAt this level, the vehicle can assist with both steering and acceleration/deceleration, but the driver must still be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle at any time. Examples of Level 2 automation include Tesla's Autopilot and GM's Super Cruise.✔Level 3: Conditional automationIn Level 3, the vehicle can take full control in certain situations, such as on the highway. However, the driver must still be ready to take control when prompted by the system. Currently, there are no Level 3 vehicles available for sale to the public.✔Level 4: High automationAt this level, the vehicle is capable of performing all driving tasks under certain conditions and does not require any human input. However, Level 4 vehicles are still limited to certain environments or scenarios, such as a self-driving taxi in a designated area or a delivery vehicle on a specific route.✔Level 5: Full automationLevel 5 is the highest level of automation, where the vehicle is capable of performing all driving tasks under any conditions, without any human input. This level of automation would allow for completely autonomous transportation without the need for a human driver.With advancements in technology, we're getting closer and closer to Level 5 autonomy. Imagine the possibilities for increased safety, efficiency, and accessibility on our roads. What are your thoughts on the future of autonomous vehicles?

For drivers who were not using Autopilot technology, we recorded one crash for every 1.40 million miles driven. By comparison, the most recent data available from NHTSA and FHWA (from 2021) shows that in the US there was an automobile crash approximately every 652,000 miles.""So it does seem like the autopilot is actually working.As a matter of fact here’s what customers had to say:“Yesterday my Model Y's active safety features saved me form a crash.

Musk emphasized the importance of integrating solar energy into homes and buildings, and the company is planning to offer a complete solar energy package that includes solar panels, battery storage, and electric car charging.In addition, Tesla is working on developing a fleet of autonomous ""robotaxis"", which Musk believes could eventually replace traditional ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. This is an ambitious goal, but Tesla has already made significant progress in autonomous driving technology with its Autopilot feature.His ambition is to be building 20m cars a year and his way of integrating the design of factories and cars together is a novel way forward.If you would like to check out the vision for your business get in touch for a complimentary initial review.#Tesla#MasterPlan3#sustainableenergy#electriccars#autonomousdriving#solarpowerhttps://lnkd.in/eVzjHZjw",0.9783,0.48557098765432105,15 ,12,0

Charan A,13-03-2023,"Tesla - Dealing with Data! 🤔Tesla is primarily known as an electric vehicle and energy company. However, it is also heavily involved in the collection and analysis of data, which plays a crucial role in the development and operation of its products.Tesla's vehicles are equipped with a wide array of sensors that constantly collect data on everything from speed and acceleration to battery usage and internal temperature. This data is then processed and analyzed by Tesla's advanced algorithms, which use machine learning and artificial intelligence to make real-time adjustments to the vehicle's performance and optimize its efficiency.In addition to collecting data from its vehicles, Tesla is also involved in the development of autonomous driving technology, which relies heavily on the collection and analysis of data. Tesla's Autopilot system, for example, uses a combination of cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors to collect data on the vehicle's surroundings, which is then processed and analyzed to make decisions about acceleration, braking, and steering.Beyond its vehicles, Tesla is also involved in the development of energy storage systems, such as its Powerwall and Powerpack products. These systems are designed to collect and store data on energy usage patterns, which can then be used to optimize energy consumption and reduce costs.data collection and analysis play a crucial role in its operations and the development of its products.#data",0.9665,0.5861111111111111,0,3,0

Christophe Delaurens,12-03-2023,"Réparer une Tesla coûte une fortune?Évidemment si on regarde une statistique brute, on croit atteindre une vérité incontestable.Le problème, c´est qu´on peut ainsi raconter n´importe quoi.Par exemple, on compare un modèle électrique avec des modèles thermiques qui n´ont pas de version électrique. Bilan, en effet, en cas d´accident, la prise en compte de l´impact de la batterie peut avoir un effet inflationniste. Mais c´est normal.Cependant, le coût de la réparation n´est pas un problème puisqu'il est pris en charge par les assurances.Donc ce qu´il faut regarder, c´est l´impact de ces réparations sur le prix de l´assurance. Et là c'est une autre histoire.Pour au moins 3 raisons:1) les teslas sont les voitures les plus sûres du monde en cas d´accident. On le voit lors des crash tests.  Elles évitent les dommages corporels. Notamment grâce aux batteries qui renforcent la structure.2) les teslas ont une excellente tenue de route grâce aussi aux batteries et au centre de gravité plus bas, donc moins d´accidents3) les teslas ont aussi moins d'accidents que les autres marques, parce que leur système de sécurité est très efficace. Grâce au logiciel de surveillance qui utilise les fonctionnalités de l´autopilote, la voiture est capable toute seule de prendre en charge des situations d´urgence, de changer seule de trajectoire, d´accélérer ou de ralentir violemment pour éviter l´accident et sans doute pour en réduire les conséquences.En plus, les voitures électriques sont plus fiables.Toutes ces fonctionnalités font qu´une tesla est sans doute plus chère à réparer mais moins chère à assurer,  mais est ce plus important qu´éviter la mort des conducteurs.

Dave W.,12-03-2023,"“The safety pilot can disconnect a system and revert the aircraft to manual flying, but otherwise doesn’t do anything but monitor the system. It’s a very boring job,” Piette explains.What good pilot in their right mind would want this? Maybe out of desperation? Think of it this way, if the pilot experience is dumbed down like this, when someone needs to take over, will we have the ""best and most skilled"" operators there to save our lives? And what about skill atrophy?The industry needs to look at how they craft the pilot experience. Experience design is not just for passengers.Think about it. People pay good money for good experiences. If you craft the right experience for pilots, that becomes part of the pay model, or what they get in return for working that job. You attract the people you want to fly by how you craft that experience.Who do you think will want this experience?Who do you want saving your life or your loved ones when things don't go right?

Tech On Wheels,11-03-2023,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States has launched an investigation into Tesla’s Model Y SUV after two complaints were made regarding the steering wheels coming off while driving. The probe will cover an estimated 120,000 vehicles from the 2023 model year. The NHTSA stated that both incidents happened while the SUVs had low mileage, and in both cases, the Model Ys were delivered with a missing bolt that holds the wheel to the steering column. A friction fit held the steering wheels on, but they separated when force was exerted while the SUVs were being driven. This latest issue adds to a long list of problems that Tesla is experiencing with the US road safety agency, including investigations into the “Autopilot” driver-assist system crashing into parked emergency vehicles, problems with suspensions, and sudden braking.www.techonwheels.co.nz#Tesla#ModelY#steeringwheel#safety#NHTSA#investigation#autoindustry#autopilot#roadsafety#recalls#administration",-0.7184,0.425,0,1,0

Raúl Moreno.,10-03-2023,"Cómo Tesla introdujo una cadena de suministro inteligente de vehículos eléctricos.⏹ El concepto de que los vehículos son dispositivos inteligentes es relativamente nuevo, y ha surgido en gran medida como resultado de las aportaciones de Tesla a la industria automovilística.✅  A medida que la industria se orienta hacia el ejemplo de Tesla de vehículos eléctricos que pueden actualizarse con una simple actualización de software es muy notable lo lejos que han llegado las cadenas de suministro de estos vehículos eléctricos inteligentes en su corta historia.✅ En términos generales se puede describir a los IEV como plataformas automovilísticas con capacidades inteligentes añadidas en comparación con el vehículo tradicional de motor de combustión interna (ICE).⏹ Estas capacidades pueden incluir muchos conceptos introducidos por Tesla, como una arquitectura eléctrica/electrónica centralizada (arquitectura E/E), una plataforma fácilmente actualizable, un énfasis en los datos del vehículo y suficiente potencia informática para permitir una conducción semiautomatizada.⏹  Cuando Tesla inició su negocio de IEV, tuvo que invertir miles de millones de dólares en sistemas de baterías, arquitecturas E/E, capacidades de conducción autónoma y cabinas inteligentes.✅ Inicialmente Tesla deependía de las cadenas de suministro externas, antes de cambiar hacia la I+D sobre inteligencia en sus vehículos, especialmente sus tecnologías beta Autopilot y Full Self-Driving.✅ La decisión de Tesla de poseer toda su cadena de suministro ha abierto oportunidades para que otros fabricantes sigan su ejemplo. En lugar de depender de terceros para la fabricación de sistemas informáticos, Tesla también ha desarrollado su propio sistema informático.✅ Hace tan solo cinco años en Estados Unidos costaba más de mil millones de dólares desarrollar un nuevo EV.✅ Tras los esfuerzos de Tesla, la cadena de suministro ha crecido significativamente y ahora ofrece opciones más eficientes y rentables para desarrollar un IEV. hasta reducir el coste actual del desarrollo de un IEV es de tan sólo 200 millones de dólares.Fuente:https://lnkd.in/gyqC-XGs#automotive#automotriz#automoción#eMobility#Batteries#ElectricVehicles#Ev",0.8225,0.37678571428571433,0,10,1

Benny Huang,09-03-2023,"Recently, I've taken more time to think about the reasons why I began my journey into coding. A lot of it has to do with my interest in technology, but it was also because of my time working at Tesla. I worked on the Autopilot team as a Data Labeler, where my day-to-day work consisted of contributing labeled images that would be used to train the Autopilot system.It was my first time experiencing how amazing technology can be when it's powered by machine-learning algorithms. I was fascinated by the idea of creating intelligent systems that can analyze and interpret data in order to make accurate predictions and decisions. Seeing the Autopilot system in action, and knowing that my labeled images contributed to its development, was a truly rewarding experience. It sparked my interest in machine learning and inspired me to pursue further knowledge in this field.So toward the end of 2021, I decided to apply to Hack Reactor, where I learned how to create full-stack applications and understand the basic fundamentals of programming.But now...I'm interested in starting my journey to learn machine learning and would love some guidance from those who are already experienced in the field. Can you recommend any resources or courses that you found particularly helpful when you were starting out? What advice would you give to someone who is just beginning to explore this area?I appreciate any insights or recommendations you can share.

The wheels were refitted but were only held in place by friction—Tesla workers never replaced the retaining bolt that affixes the steering wheel to the steering column.The ODI document states that ""sudden separation occurred when the force exerted on the steering wheel overcame the resistance of the friction fit while the vehicles were in motion"" and that both incidents occurred while the electric vehicles still had low mileage.In addition to this probe, NHTSA is also investigating whether Tesla Autopilot can detect and avoid motorcycles, why Autopilot keeps hitting emergency vehicles, and whether the removal of radar sensors on Tesla vehicles has caused hundreds of phantom braking events.Read more viaArs Technica:",-0.6652,0.5399999999999999,4 ,22,0

Adam Qureshi,08-03-2023,"AUTOPILOT 4.0. BETTER. FASTER. AI. Maybe?Based on Tesla's past hardware improvements, it's likely that Autopilot hardware 4.0 will feature a significant boost in processing power and memory to enable more advanced autonomous driving capabilities. This could be achieved through the use of a new, more powerful processor or a combination of multiple processors working in parallel.Tesla may also upgrade the cameras and sensors used for Autopilot to improve object detection and tracking, as well as to enhance the system's ability to perceive the environment in greater detail. Additionally, it's possible that Tesla may incorporate lidar sensors into Autopilot hardware 4.0, which could provide a more accurate and comprehensive view of the vehicle's surroundings.Another area where Tesla could make improvements is in the use of machine learning algorithms. Autopilot 4.0 could potentially feature more advanced and sophisticated algorithms that can learn from driving data and improve the system's ability to predict and react to different driving scenarios.Overall, Autopilot hardware 4.0 is likely to represent a significant improvement over previous versions, enabling more advanced autonomous driving capabilities and providing a more seamless and intuitive driving experience. However, it's important to note that autonomous driving technology is still in the early stages of development, and it may be some time before fully self-driving vehicles become a reality.#tesla#ai",0.992,0.6178885630498533,0,1,0

Rajesh Gopinath Kumar,08-03-2023,"Tesla currently offers several optional features that customers can purchase for their vehicles, such as autopilot, full self-driving capability, and premium connectivity. While these features can provide significant benefits to some customers, they may not be necessary or desirable for all.Enabling ""pay per use"" for these features could potentially expand Tesla's testing base, as more customers would be willing to try them out without committing to purchasing them outright. This could provide valuable data and feedback for Tesla to improve and refine these features.However, there are some potential challenges and drawbacks to implementing a ""pay per use"" model for Tesla's features. For example, it could be difficult to accurately measure usage and bill customers accordingly. It could also lead to confusion and dissatisfaction if customers are not fully aware of the costs and limitations of using these features on a pay-per-use basis.Additionally, implementing this model could be seen as a departure from Tesla's current approach of offering these features as optional upgrades at a fixed price. It may also be seen as a cash grab or a way to nickel-and-dime customers, which could damage Tesla's reputation and customer loyalty.W#datahile there are potential benefits to implementing a pay-per-use model for Tesla's features, it would require careful consideration and planning to ensure that it is implemented in a fair and transparent way that benefits both Tesla and its customers.",0.8974,0.6609649122807018,0,0,0

Joe Olivares,08-03-2023,"As someone in the insurance industry and a proud owner of a Tesla, I found the recently shared stats on FSD Beta's safety quite interesting. It's impressive that the system experienced an airbag-deployed crash about every 3.2 million miles in the last 12 months, making it about five times safer than the most recently available US average of 600,000 miles per police-reported crash.However, it's important to note that FSD Beta specifically works for inner-city streets, which involve many edge cases and unpredictable driving behaviors from other vehicles. As such, its safety stats are not as impressive as Autopilot's recent results, which recorded one crash for every 6.26 million miles driven in which drivers were using Autopilot.Despite the controversy surrounding FSD Beta, its adoption is increasing at a steady pace. As per updates from Tesla during Investor Day, FSD and Autopilot are still critical components of Tesla's overall plan, as the systems would increase the utilization rate of the company's vehicles. In fact, FSD Beta has been released to almost all customers in the US and Canada who purchased FSD, which translates to about 400,000 owners.As insurance professionals, what do you think of FSD Beta's safety stats compared to Autopilot? Do you believe the adoption of FSD and Autopilot would impact the insurance industry in the long run? Let's discuss it!",0.9715,0.5670833333333334,1 ,3,0

Matthias Heller,08-03-2023,"Does Tesla have a competitive advantage against other car companies through its active learning pipeline?Tesla's Autopilot uses active learning to improve the system based on what their customer's cars see on the road. By using active learning, the Autopilot system can continually improve its decision-making capabilities and become more accurate over time. Why do I think this could be a competitive advantage:🚗 Tesla has roughly 750,000 cars with 8 surround cameras that likely drive about an hour per day on average.💾 That's about 170 million hours of video per month across the eight cameras on each vehicle.📈 They collect valuable metainformation including the disagreement between ML models and driver (called shadowing)Many other companies don't have access to such a data pool because their production cars are not connected to the ML pipeline and have limited compute for ML. Some companies only have between 20-1000 data collection vehicles. That's not all:⛏  Tesla can mine interesting data points from the fleet💻  Tesla can use the customers' car as storage and compute☁  Tesla can update their Autopilot over the airFrom my experience, the successful deployment of ML models in production relies heavily on the availability of representative training data; Tesla appears to have an advantage in obtaining such data.What do you think?

Enrique B.,08-03-2023,"La eclosión de los coches eléctricos pone a prueba la adaptabilidad de las compañías aseguradorasInteresantísimo post sobre los#segurosdecocheelectrico, el tema da para mucho.La cobertura de cualquier inversión forma una parte  esencial de nuestro diseño y ejecución de proyectos para nuestros clientes. Aplicamos nuestro -CONÊTIKA®-  expertise en la consultoría aseguradora, potenciado por la incorporación del área de cobertura fotovoltaica y de movilidad eléctrica (tanto infraestructura  como#BEV).Comparto cuestiones analizadas, aunque habría que tener la foto global de datos para afinar.V.gr. el seguro de#BEV. Creo que los#vehículoseléctricostienen variables de mayor riesgo y otras que compensan las mismas. El balance neto y como reducir las de mayor riesgo, es la parte complicada.Algunos de los items me parecen muy reveladores.V.gr. , no tengo duda que el autopilot (en su nivel de desarrollo actual)  incrementa el riesgo en la conducción, ahora bien, en cuanto? si contraponemos al autopilot el control de crucero adaptativo (CCA), este mejora de forma muy relevante la seguridad en la conducción. Dado que el#autopilotno deja de ser una derivada de nivel superior al CCA, cuál sería el balance neto de riesgo? bajo mi experiencia y  tomando como referencia, por ejemplo,Teslay su autopilot,  se impone el CCA. El % de uso de ambos se decanta netamente a favor de este.Me llama la atención el dato del#overttapingcomo factor de riesgo, me pregunto para qué existe el mapeo de potencia, el nivel soft aporta un % muy inferior de potencia y le resta mucha explosividad en la aceleración.La variable que más riesgo aporta es el precio de los componentes, especialmente las baterías. En este punto es clave, a efectos del tomador del seguro, garantizarse, al menos durante 3 años,  un valor a nuevo en caso de siniestro total. Obviamente, incrementa el riesgo de la Cia.Por el momento no he detectado una penalización del seguro del BEV, no como producto específico para este, sino general. De hecho,me sorprenden algunas Cias. y#mediadoresque anuncian, con grandes alharacas,  seguros específicos para BEV, no acabo de ver el valor añadido del mismo por ningún lado.En el sector asegurador es especialmente relevante, diría imprescindible, la#IA-#machinelearning. La cantidad de datos que maneja el sector es increíble, ahora bien, tener muchos datos y no sacarles todo el potencial limita las decisiones estratégicas y los, consecuentes, beneficios B2C.Queda mucho por evolucionar en este campo, tampoco hay que olvidar que exige inversiones muy relevantes, claro que no hay nada más rentable para una Cia. de seguros que afinar al máximo la tasa que impacta en la prima, dado que permite evitarse sustos en las carteras y obtener  una relevante ventaja competitiva en el mercado.https://lnkd.in/de3yyykR",-0.7941,0.43333333333333335,0,2,0

Philip Bateman,08-03-2023,"""Full self driving will never happen"" - ""Teslaare <_____>"" - ""It's decades away"" - insert additional comments from armchair LinkedIn user with no stake in the game or expertise in the domain ad nauseum.  So anyway, at 1 hour 38 minutes in the 2023 Tesla investor day they get stuck into things =Crash wise, the US average is half a million miles per incident, Tesla are averaging 3.2 million per incident using the Full Self Driving beta.They currently have 14,000 GPUs (graphics processing units) split between 4,000 for auto-labelling everything the fleet are seeing (car drives down street, sees object, needs to know what that object is, gives it a label based on visual recognition software, eg tree, sign post, cat), and 10,000 for training the cars on that data.Each day they are looking at 500,000 videos in the training bank, which is 1.44billion visual frames of information, and they have a completely virtualised world with vehicles and weather patterns, running in the background that the cars are driving themselves around in.As the cars aren't actually 'cars' in the traditional sense, they are mobile computers acting as nodes in a network, that blends the back-end infrastructure of servers, AI, mapping and analytics with their rolling intelligence, they can do things such as the image that shows you 'predictive air suspension'.This is where the fleet of vehicles act as a hive mind, with an individual cars inertial sensors detecting rough road, the autopilot computers GPS and localiser figures out where the vehicle is in the world, then the navigation server anonymously aggregates this data and creates a real time map.As your vehicle is approaching rough road, the on board computers automatically adjust the suspension stiffness to account for it, and then go back to standard settings. More so, because they can ship software updates to cars (and do, regularly) over the air, they first installed this on thousands of vehicles, and let it run in software only mode, meaning it sent back to the servers each time it would or wouldn't have adjusted the suspension, for tens of thousands of miles of real world driving, before they turned it actively on.You'll notice the first slide is two robots working on a third. These walk around now, and are using hand tools. And they are controlled by the same software that runs the cars.Because the cars aren't cars. And the robots aren't robots. They are nodes in a massive network. Like you and I, are as we walk around with our phones, plugged into this evolving digital world.Cool huh?#tesla#autonomy#fullselfdriving#ai#software#automotive",0.9022,0.3286513323278029,0,4,0

Stephen Savage,08-03-2023,"Have you been looking for Meta's advantage + campaign equivalent on TikTok?Well, it may finally be here.TikTok has recently rolled out a brand new campaign type called Smart Performance campaigns (SPC campaigns for short). It's my belief that this is in direct response to Meta's widespread rollout of Advantage + shopping campaigns that have revolutionized the way that media buyers are advertising on Meta.So what are SPC campaigns and why do you need to be testing them?SPC campaigns are TikToks first end-to-end automation solution that leverages machine learning to optimize for best performance and marketing goals. This campaign type gives advertisers the least amount of control over their campaigns/audiences and hands the wheel over to the TikTok algorithm (similar to Tesla's new autopilot mode).How do these new features translate in-engine?Through initial test, we have seen some SPC campaigns outperform our control group ROAS by a margin of 112%, but we have also seen them be outperformed by control groups as well.Why are some SPC campaigns scaling accounts to efficiencies we have been unable to reach prior and others being less efficient than our BAU campaigns?The simple answer seems to be Spark ads. We know spark ads outperform in-feed ads in general, but see this margin heightened when used in SPC campaigns.Are SPC campaigns going to make TikTok a more competitive platform since it's eliminating learning barriers for new advertisers?Maybe, but one barrier will always stand, separating the top 1%  of advertisers from the rest.

With the rise of#aipowered automation, it's becoming easier than ever to streamline complex processes, reduce overhead costs, and increase employee productivity. However, as we become increasingly reliant on these technologies, the question of business autonomy becomes increasingly important.As humans, we're naturally drawn to#efficiencyand#convenience, and AI and automation certainly provide both. But at what cost? Are we becoming too dependent on technology, to the point where it's controlling us instead of the other way around?This is where the concept of business autonomy comes into play.In a world of constant technological advancements, it's crucial for businesses to maintain control over their own operations and decision-making processes. While AI and automation can certainly provide valuable insights and support, they should never be a replacement for human decision-making.Recent events have highlighted the importance of business autonomy. From the#teslaAutopilot crashes to the#boeing737maxcontroversy, we've seen the potential dangers of over reliance on technology. These events demonstrate the need for businesses to prioritize human oversight and decision-making in order to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.So, what can businesses do to maintain autonomy in a world of automation?One key strategy is to focus on hiring and training employees who are skilled in both technology and critical thinking. By empowering employees to make informed decisions and take ownership of their work, businesses can ensure that they remain in control of their own operations. By#empoweringemployees to take ownership of their work, businesses can ensure that they remain in control of their own operations.In conclusion, while automation certainly has its benefits, by prioritizing human oversight and critical thinking, businesses can reap the benefits of technology while avoiding the potential pitfalls of overreliance.Let's work together to build a world where technology works for us, not the other way around.#automation#ai#criticalthinking#humanitarian",0.9708,0.5892006802721088,0,6,0

LEON FAMILY OFFICE,08-03-2023,"“Next generation Tesla” has not arrived yet.Highlights from Tesla Investor Day 2023:While investors were waiting for a new master plan for the company and the presentation of a new generation car from Elon Musk, Tesla shares went up sharply.  Since the beginning of 2023, TSLA stock has risen by more than 50%.The wait ended in disappointment yesterday. Investors listened to a 4-hour presentation and talk about how Tesla will transition to sustainable energy, about new plants in Mexico and Arizona (which is actually not bad), but they don’t have any prototype of a new electric car or a breakthrough platform to show.We remind you that the TSLA super-bulls case is a platform that will sell all kinds of subscriptions and services to the TSLA owner. Here Elon invited the audience to take his word for it. As a result, the share price fell by 5.7% after the market closed.LEON's opinion:The value of Tesla shares is a unique case that depends on Elon Musk's “factor”, as what he says/does publicly affects Tesla shares in a drastic way.Still, considering the current share price around $195, we have reached a business valuation range for Tesla:·       “Tesla will be like Porsche”: $150 per share is TSLA’s valuation as a premium car manufacturer.·       “Tesla will be like Apple”: the company could be worth $200 per share if Musk’s promises about an ecosystem of services, subscription autopilots, robot taxis, etc. come true.Therefore, in our opinion, Tesla shares can be bought at levels of around $120 and below, with profit taking in the range of $150-$200.#tesla#stocks#estimates#portfolioconstruction#energy#electricalvehicle#sustainable",0.9894,0.43857808857808855,0,16,1

Wanir Souza,08-03-2023,"Quem tem medo de veículos autônomos? Muita gente. Pelo menos é o que revela recente pesquisa feita pela American Automobile Association (AAA). O levantamento aponta que (bem) mais da metade dos motoristas norte-americanos têm receio dos carros que andam sozinhos.O estudo da AAA revela que 68% dos motoristas demonstraram preocupação em andar em veículos autônomos. O que revela um aumento significativo na desconfiança da população. Na pesquisa feita pela entidade em 2022, o número de pessoas que tinham medo da tecnologia foi de 55%.A pesquisa também mostrou que muitos motoristas ainda têm dúvidas quanto à funcionalidade dos sistemas de auxílio à condução. Um exemplo é que 10% dos entrevistados acreditam que podem até dormir enquanto o veículo autônomo anda sozinho - um nível de automação que ainda não está disponível no mercado.Além disso, 22% dizem que os nomes dos sistemas de auxílio ao motorista confundem o usuário. Para os entrevistados, termos como Autopilot (Tesla), Pilot Assist (Volvo) e ProPILOT (Nissan) dão a entender que são dispositivos que permitem que o carro ande sozinho sem qualquer interferência ou supervisão do condutor.Greg Brannon, diretor de pesquisa automotiva da AAA, disse que o resultado do estudo não causa surpresas.

NHTSA said that Tesla’s software could cause vehicles to travel through intersections unlawfully or unpredictably, or exceed speed limits, increasing the risk of a crash.According to a report by the Reuters news agency, U.S. senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal said the recall was “long overdue,” and added that “Tesla must finally stop overstating the real capabilities of its vehicles.”NHTSA’s recall is the latest in a series of safety concerns in the United States over Tesla’s driver assistance system. Last year, the company recalled almost 54,000 US vehicles with FSD beta software due to concerns over the system’s ability to conduct rolling stops, posing a safety risk.

"Gervais  T. Mbunkeu, M.Eng, M.Sc, CCSK",08-03-2023,"Today marks the fourth anniversary of Jeremy Banner’s death. He was a software engineer and an avid Tesla fan. He died when his Tesla with Autopilot activated crashed into a crossing tractor trailer. Mr. Banner’s death wasn’t the first involving Tesla’s Autopilot, but it occurred almost 3 years after Joshua Brown’s in Florida, in nearly identical conditions (see the below crash scene drawings). It happened one year after Apple Engineer, Walter Huang’s fatal crash, also due to Autopilot failure on US 101 in California.This death could’ve been prevented, the NTSB investigation and report into Joshua Brown’s 2016 fatal crash laid out in details what caused the crash and proposed recommendations for Tesla and other Level 2 OEMs, and the USDOT. If it turns out that Autopilot or FSD was activated in last week’s fatal crash in California involving a Tesla plowing into a fire truck; the NTSB’s recommendations would’ve gone unheeded for 6 years.What more? In his concurring opinion, NTSB member, Chris Hart added some poignant comments that are as relevant today as they were then, namely:- “Automation in cars offers significant potential to save tens of thousands of lives everyday by eventually replacing the driver(jury is still out on that claim in my view)… introducing automation into such a complex and unstructured environment will be very challenging and must be pursued thoughtfully and with considerable caution.”- He drew comparisons to the early days of aviation automation when the industry adopted automation simply because it had acquired the technological capability to do so. “Because we can” automation doesn’t improve the human-automation system.- The human element must be adequately considered. Monitoring driver engagement in the driving task is paramount for advanced driver assistance systems.- The moniker “Autopilot” may convey a false sense of security and cause drivers to not pay attention to the driving task.Tesla basically ignored the NTSB’s recommendations, so didNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA(at least until the recent standing order on crash reporting) and the USDOT. Several more fatal crashes involving Autopilot have occurred since 2019, nearly 2 dozens by some accounts.

Phillipe Xavier,08-03-2023,"Would that be a problem for you?Privacy and security are actual issues from a user's perspective from social platforms like TikTok to brands like Tesla.🎯 TikTok has faced several privacy concerns in the past, including allegations that the app collects user data and shares it with the Chinese government.The app has also been accused of not properly disclosing its data collection practices to users, and of using facial recognition technology without consent.They denied these allegations and have taken steps to address concerns, such as opening a ""Transparency Center"" in the United States to allow outside experts to review its code.🚘 As for Tesla, the company has faced criticism for its Autopilot feature, which some have argued is not safe enough and has led to accidents.Tesla has also been accused of collecting data from its vehicles without obtaining proper consent from users.Additionally, Tesla's use of cameras and sensors in its vehicles has raised privacy concerns, with some worrying that the company could use the data it collects for surveillance purposes.It's important to note that both TikTok and Tesla have taken steps to address these issues and have stated their commitment to user privacy and security.However, it's always important for users to be aware of the potential risks associated with using any technology, and to take steps to protect their personal information 😉",0.5321,0.3231481481481482,2 ,2,0

At the time, Tesla was releasing early versions of Autopilot, its AI-enabled driver assistance software with autonomous aspirations (arguably, delusions), and developing AI-enabled robots for its factories.In 2016, she became VP of product and engineering at Leap Motion, which was working on an augmented reality system designed to replace keyboards and mice with hand gestures. Murati wanted to make the experience of interacting with a computer “as intuitive as playing with a ball.”But she soon realized that the technology, which relied on a VR headset, was too early.As she considered what to do next, she concluded that a “massive advancement in technology” would have to play a role in solving the world’s biggest challenges, like the climate crisis.At OpenAI, which she joined in 2018, she found kindred spirits who shared her growing conviction that AGI would be that technology.https://bit.ly/3SBZrw8",0.9287,0.4666666666666666,1 ,79,9

Code6,01-03-2023,"Tesla pauses rollout of Full Self&Driving beta software.Tesla paused the rollout of its Full Self-Driving beta software in the United States and Canada following a recall of the system that federal safety regulators warned could allow vehicles to act unsafe around intersections and cause crashes.Tesla said in a new company support page that new or pending installations of FSD beta software — an advanced driver assistance system that costs $15,000 — will be halted until it issues an over-the-air software update that corrects the issue. The software update is free.“Until the software version containing the fix is available, we have paused the rollout of FSD Beta to all who have opted-in but have not yet received a software version containing FSD Beta,” the company wrote on the support page.Earlier this month, Tesla said it was recalling certain 2016–2023 Model S and Model X vehicles; 2017–2023 Model 3 vehicles; and 2020–2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software or those pending installation. The recall, which was posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website, affects as many as 362,758 vehicles equipped with the software, according to the notice.This recall affects only U.S. and Canada vehicles. Affected vehicles were identified based on vehicle manufacturing, configuration, and software records.Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver-assistance system branded as Autopilot. For an additional $15,000, owners can buy “full self-driving,” or FSD — a feature that CEO Elon Musk has promised for years will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. Tesla vehicles are not self-driving.Instead, FSD includes a number of automated driving features that still require the driver to be ready to take control at all times. It includes the parking feature Summon, as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes. The system is also supposed to handle steering on city streets and recognize and react to traffic lights and stop signs.Notably, the company support page acknowledges that the system in certain rare circumstances could potentially infringe upon local traffic laws or customs while executing these driving maneuvers in specific conditions before the driver may intervene.Tesla also describes FSD as a Level 2 system on the support page, a designation that while obvious may come as a disappointment to shareholders and owners who support Musk’s belief that the vehicles will be “self driving.”There are five levels of automation under standards created by SAE International. Level 2 means two primary functions — like adaptive cruise and lane keeping — are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times.Tesla pauses rollout of Full Self-Driving beta software by Kirsten Korosec originally published on TechCrunchhttps://lnkd.in/dFmysPrA",0.9891,0.49423160173160174,0,0,0

Harald M. Depta,01-03-2023,"In der vergangenen Woche machte die Nachricht von einem Rückruf der Beta-Software#FSDfür das Autopilot-System von#Tesladie Runde. CEO Elon Musk wies jedoch darauf hin, dass es sich hierbei nicht um einen Rückruf im eigentlichen Sinne handle.Dennoch bezeichneten sowohl die Verkehrsbehörde NHTSA als auch Tesla selbst die Aktion als solchen. Ein neues Support-Dokument zeigt nun, dass vorerst keine neuen Kunden die Beta-#Softwareerhalten werden.FSD steht für Full Self-Driving und bezeichnet sowohl die Option, die man in den#USAfür 15.000 Dollar kaufen kann, als auch die Software selbst. Obwohl es nach autonomem Fahren klingt, ist dies im Kleingedruckten bei der Bestellung und bei der Aktivierung deutlich gemacht: FSD ist keineswegs so zu verstehen. Die#NHTSAforderte Ende Januar einen Rückruf der Beta-Software, da sie in bestimmten Situationen das#Unfallrisikoerhöhe. Tesla teilte diese Einschätzung nicht, entschied sich aber zu einem freiwilligen Rückruf.Betroffen sind potenziell 362.758 Fahrzeuge von Model 3 bis Model X aus den Jahren 2016 bis 2023, bei denen es sich um alle in den USA handeln dürfte, deren Käufer die FSD-Option dazugewählt haben. Der Beta-Test begann im Oktober 2020 mit einem kleinen Kreis und wurde langsam erweitert.Im November 2022 kündigte CEO Musk an, dass ab sofort alle Tesla-Fahrzeuge mit FSD-Option in Nordamerika daran teilnehmen könnten. Im Geschäftsbericht für das vierte Quartal 2022 wurde diese Zahl dann mit rund 400.000 in den USA und Kanada angegeben.Gemäß des Rückruf-Dokuments hat Tesla die Verbreitung von FSD Beta an alle pausiert, die sich angemeldet, aber noch keine Software-Version mit FSD Beta erhalten haben. Es ist jedoch unklar, welchen Anteil der genannten 400.000 Kunden das ausmacht und wann die#Verbreitungwieder aufgenommen wird. In der Rückruf-Mitteilung wurde jedoch angekündigt, dass in den kommenden Wochen ein#Updatefür die Beta-Software verbreitet werden soll, das das Verhalten in problematischen Situationen verbessert. Dies dürfte auch für den Neustart der FSD-Verbreitung an zusätzliche Kunden gelten.Tesla-Besitzer mit bezahlter#Optionund angemeldeter Test-Teilnahme müssen daher vorerst warten, bevor sie aufgenommen werden können. Das bedeutet auch, dass vorerst keine neu gekauften#Elektroautosvon Tesla die Beta-Software erhalten können. Im Umkehrschluss bestätigen die veröffentlichten Hinweise jedoch, dass FSD bis zum Vorliegen des Updates nicht deaktiviert wird, wenn es bereits vor dem Rückruf installiert war. Eine weitere Ausweitung des Beta-Tests in den USA ist jedoch vorerst unterbunden. Bisherige Teilnehmer erhalten erst dann wieder eine neue Version von FSD, wenn sie die von der Behörde geforderten Verbesserungen enthält.#emobilität#unternehmen#assistenz#probleme#elektroauto",-0.9961,0.55,0,0,0

And while details about the vehicle will likely be discussed on Investor Day, the Wall Street veteran shared some tidbits about what New Street expects from the vehicle.First off, Ferragu estimated that the upcoming vehicle would be about 15% shorter, 30% lighter, and have a battery that’s 25% smaller than the pack installed on the Model 3. The analyst explained how New Street Research was able to come up with its estimates. “We looked at how ICE compacts compare to mid-size ICE sedans and extrapolated the comparison between Model 3 and ICE mid-size sedans to reach this conclusion,” Ferragu wrote on Twitter.Apart from this, New Street Research expects the “Model 2” to be about 37% less expensive to build compared to the Model 3. Half of these cost savings would likely be due to the car’s smaller size, while the other half would likely be due to design, architecture, and manufacturing innovations. Elon Musk, for his part, has mentioned in the past that with its next-generation platform, Tesla would aim to make two cars for the same effort it takes to produce one Model 3 today.Considering the advantages inherent in Teslas, such as FSD/Autopilot, superior range and performance, as well as the Supercharger Network, Ferragu noted that the “Model 2” would likely command a premium over vehicles like the Toyota Corolla, similar to how the Model 3 commands a premium over a Honda Accord. Despite this, the “Model 2” would likely be competitive. This was certainly the case last year wth the Model 3 and Model Y, both of which performed well despite their steep prices.That being said, the analyst noted that Tesla might be able to maintain a gross margin heading towards 30% for vehicles, even with a smaller, more affordable vehicle in the mix. And considering its expected price of $25K MSRP, the upcoming affordable electric car would effectively address about 80% of the auto market. With this, Ferragu noted that the vehicle could ultimately pave the way for Tesla to exceed 12 million units in 2030. This is optimistic considering Tesla’s volumes today, though it should be noted that the EV maker is looking to achieve an output of 20 million vehicles per year by the end of the decade.""",0.9468,0.5028723528723529,0,1,0

Coen Hooijer,01-03-2023,"Met je Tesla op skivakantie naar Oostenrijk of Frankrijk? Negeer de Tesla laadstop suggesties!Vuistregel: Range anxiety bestaat niet.De Tesla navigatie zal je zo ‘veilig’ mogelijk een route voorstellen tot de eerstvolgende Supercharger maar je kunt jouw Tesla tijdens een lange rit het beste leegrijden tot ergens tussen de 0-10%. Je hebt in een Model 3 of Y namelijk op 0% nog steeds 4 kWh bruikbaar, dat is nog zo’n 20 km resterend. BijMisterGreen | Netherlandsrijden we het liefste tot 0%, elk procent extra is eigenlijk te veel. Maak je geen zorgen met een lege batterij stil te vallen, want om je batterij leeg te rijden moet je wel echt je best doen.Vaak zal de Tesla bij vertrek vanuit de Randstad met 85-100% je eerst naar Duiven of Hengelo sturen, bij aankomst in Duiven heb je dan nog zo’n 65% of in Hengelo meestal nog zo’n 25-40% lading over. Je kunt dan beter doorrijden naar Oberhausen of Hilden. Dit zijn allereerst veel mooiere locaties, hebben veel meer stalls (laadplekken) en een betere lounge/shop beschikbaar. Hoe meer stalls, hoe kleiner de kans op lange wachttijden bij de Supercharger. Hier heb je met 15 max 20 minuten je auto tot 80% bijgeladen om je weg te vervolgen. Het is raadzaam om nooit meer dan 80% te laden want er zijn voldoende Superchargers beschikbaar en het duurt aanzienlijk langer om van 80-100 % dan van 10-80% te laden.De Tesla Superchargers bij Oberhausen en Hilden zijn mooie locaties om op te laden op weg naar je wintersportbestemming. In Oberhausen kun je even los op de driving range of sport kijken op het gigantische scherm.Houd rekening met rijden in Duitsland (130-190 km/h) dat je ongeveer 100 km minder kunt rijden dan je navigatie aangeeft. Hoe lager je snelheid, hoe meer rijbereik. Als jouw volgende supercharger 220 km verderop ligt dan kun je wegrijden met 320 km op de navigatie, je Tesla zal tijdens het laden aangeven dat je met te weinig batterij aankomt maar tijdens het rijden loopt dit percentage langzaam op. Bovendien zijn er in Duitsland regelmatig wegwerkzaamheden waar je 80-100 km/h rijdt, dit heeft gunstige invloed op je range.Het loont altijd om tijdens het rijden even Autopilot in te schakelen en op je scherm te zoeken naar één Supercharger verder dan Tesla navigatie je voorschotelt, tik hem in en kijk hoeveel % je overhoudt volgens de navigatie. Ook kun je zien hoeveel laadplaatsen er in totaal zijn, hoeveel er beschikbaar zijn en wat de max. laadsnelheid is. Als je een Model 3 of Y rijdt kies dan altijd voor de 250 kW Superchargers.De laatste Superchargers voor je Oostenrijk binnenrijdt zijn in Langkampfen of in Füssen, deze is nieuw en zeker een bezoekje waard. Supercharger gemist? Zoek dan een Ionity snellader via je Tesla navigatie maar hou dan rekening met hogere prijzen.#endfossilfuel#tesla#mistergreen#supercharging#norangeanxiety",0.6958,0.2,18 ,100,3

Steffen Karl,01-03-2023,"Autopilot ist „Mist“:Tesla-Gründer keilt gegen Elon Musk!Der angebliche „Autopilot“ in Tesla-Modellen sorgt immer wieder für Ärger. Jetzt hat sich Martin Eberhard, Mitgründer des Elektroauto-Pioniers, wenig schmeichelnd zu Wort gemeldet.27.02.2023, Marcus Efler-FNPDie Geschichte des Automobils ist voller Irrtümer. So behauptete der frühere US-Präsident Barack Obama einst, das Auto sei in Amerika erfunden worden – tatsächlich geschah dies 1886 in Deutschland durch die Firma Benz & Cie., heute bekannt als Mercedes-Benz. Eine andere weit verbreitete Meinung: Der erste erfolgreiche Hersteller von Elektroautos sei von dem gebürtigen Südafrikaner Elon Musk gegründet worden.Tatsächlich aber riefen die US-Amerikaner Martin Eberhard und Marc Tarpenning 2003 Tesla ins Leben. Der heutige CEO Elon Musk kaufte sich erst ein Jahr später ein, und drängte die Gründer 2007 aus dem schnell wachsenden Unternehmen. Besonders oft melden sich die beiden seitdem nicht zu Wort – anders als beispielsweise der ausgeschiedene Apple-Mitgründer Stephen „The Woz“ Wozniak, der immer mal wieder öffentlich erklärt, wie ihm iPhone und andere Entwicklungen so gefallen.Tesla-Gründer Eberhard: „Angestellte mit Respekt behandeln“Nun aber hat sich Martin Eberhard dazu geäußert, was er als Tesla-Chef anders machen würde als Elon Musk. „Ich glaube daran, Angestellte mit Respekt zu behandeln“, sagte er dem US-Wirtschaftsportal Business Insider in Anspielung auf die rüden Chef-Manieren Musks, und: „Ich bin nicht für zufälliges Feuern und solche Sachen. Wahrscheinlich wäre die Firmenkultur etwas netter.“",-0.9769,0.0,1 ,1,0

Martín Levi,01-03-2023,"I recently chatted with ChatGPT and we discussed why Tesla is likely to be the go-to electric vehicle (EV) brand. It's partly due to the company's well-established name, but also because EVs are similar to smartphones in that the operating system is a critical feature. Elon Musk is often compared to a mix of Steve Jobs and Wozniak, which is a nod to his innovative leadership style and technical expertise.What sets Tesla apart is that its operating system, the Tesla Infotainment System, was specifically designed for electric vehicles. The system runs on a customized hardware platform that includes the Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Computer, which is specially built for autonomous driving. It's equipped with two AI chips that can process vast amounts of data from the car's cameras, sensors, and other sources in real-time.What's particularly impressive about the Tesla OS is that it's software-defined, which means that most of the vehicle's features and functions are controlled by software rather than hardware. This allows Tesla to continually update and improve the driving experience for customers, providing new features and improvements over-the-air without requiring a dealership or service center.Tesla's OS is loaded with features, including Autopilot, Full-Self Driving, Caraoke, Bioweapon Defense Mode, virtual Easter eggs, and smart air suspension. Autopilot can automatically steer, accelerate, and brake, while Full-Self Driving can recognize stop lights, stop signs, and even change lanes on the highway. Caraoke is a fun feature that lets you sing karaoke while driving, and Bioweapon Defense Mode protects passengers by filtering out toxic chemicals.In addition, the Tesla OS includes hidden Easter eggs that provide a fun and unique way to interact with your car. The smart air suspension system adjusts the firmness based on GPS coordinates, providing a comfortable ride. Sentry mode allows you to monitor your parked car remotely from anywhere in the world, and Tesla's network of supercharging stations is expanding rapidly worldwide.Overall, Tesla's innovative OS and microchip have enabled a unique set of features that set its vehicles apart in the automotive market. With a powerful microchip and software-defined system, Tesla can continually update and improve its vehicles, moving at a scary pace.#automotive#change#ev#tesla#electricvehicles",0.9918,0.6331489498156165,0,1,0
Michael DeKort,01-03-2023,"Companies oversell the self-driving capabilities of their cars, with horrific outcomesYa think?While it's nice to see the press start to say these things, it's a bit frustrating that most didn't get this from day one and then need an mind-boggling amount of clear evidence to make even the slightest shift. Shame the press can't find a way to break free from echo chambers.Beyond that it's not just Tesla. Every single AV maker is lying, committing fraud and grossly negligent. They either need to harm or kill needless Guinea pigs to learn and test most crash cases. or they have to avoid them an tell the public they are good to go. Most are doing the latter. Hence, Waymo suing California to avoid providing any meaningful performance data. And NONE will provide any meaningful test data.Having said all of this, I think this is the year most find the courage to says what I have been saying for over 5 years. Question is will ANY AV maker CEO's have the courage and selflessness to admit they had the development approach all wrong and fix it? Or will they do as most have done so far? Cash in, spare their egos, say it was just too hard, go bankrupt and screw their employees and families. (Some have gone moved away from L4/5 or went to other use cases to make things easier. But NONE has admitted they had the development approach wrong.)#tesla#elonmusk#driverlesscars#driverlesscars#driverless#autonomousvehicles#selfdrivingcars#autonomous#autonomousdriving#selfdriving#adas#autonomousvehicle#driverlessvehicles#teslamotors#autopilot#autonomouscar#nhtsa#ntsb#AI#machinelearning#waymo#artificialintelligence#machinelearning#deeplearning#waymo",-0.8949,0.5774327122153209,9 ,29,2

Dr. Agus Budiyono,01-03-2023,"ON AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATIONAutonomous or driverless cars are becoming increasingly popular as technology advances, and Tesla is one of the leading companies in this field. Tesla's latest technology for autonomous cars is their Autopilot system, which uses a combination of cameras, sensors, and software to enable the car to drive itself in certain situations.The Autopilot system includes a range of features, including adaptive cruise control, which adjusts the car's speed based on the speed of the vehicle in front, and lane departure warning, which alerts the driver if the car is drifting out of its lane. The system also includes a feature called Navigate on Autopilot, which allows the car to navigate on highways and take exits without the driver's input.One of the most impressive aspects of Tesla's autonomous car technology is its ability to learn and improve over time. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from millions of miles of driving, constantly improving its ability to detect and respond to different situations on the road.However, it's important to note that Tesla's Autopilot system is not fully autonomous and still requires the driver to be alert and ready to take control of the vehicle at any time. Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and remain vigilant while using Autopilot.Overall, Tesla's Autopilot system represents the latest technology for autonomous cars, offering a range of features designed to make driving safer and more efficient. As technology continues to advance, it's likely that we will see more and more autonomous cars on the road, transforming the way we travel and reducing the risk of accidents caused by human error.Source: FSD Beta 10.9 drive by @WholeMarsBlog#driverlesscar#autonomouscar#ArtificialIntelligence#selfdriving#innovation#MachineLearning",0.9722,0.67521645021645,0,26,0

Michael DeKort,01-03-2023,"I hear EU AV Type Cert folks are requesting testing be done in simulation and that it needs to include the perception/sensor system not skip it and go right to the planning system. While this is an excellent development, there is a major issue here.The most important is the simulation products used and created in this industry are gaming technology based. That means they cannot handle proper real-time, especially when loaded. And they cannot facilitate the use of proper sensor models. Those being exact sensor models built with real-world performance curves. Without this modeling transition zones between objects and the environment will be flawed and create development and testing false confidence.If anyone knows who the folks are in this EU group and can connect me to them so we can have a chat on this I would appreciate it.And if any AV maker, simulation company or test organization would like to be the first to do this right, please let me know that as well.How the failed Iranian hostage rescue in 1980 can save the Autonomous Vehicle industryhttps://lnkd.in/dBygd9w#tesla#elonmusk#driverlesscars#driverlesscars#driverless#autonomousvehicles#selfdrivingcars#autonomous#autonomousdriving#selfdriving#adas#autonomousvehicle#driverlessvehicles#teslamotors#autopilot#autonomouscar#nhtsa#ntsb#AI#machinelearning#waymo#artificialintelligence#machinelearning#deeplearning#waymo",0.9558,0.5303174603174603,0,23,3

Baba Mulani,01-03-2023,"Many EVs come equipped with advanced onboard data systems that provide drivers with real-time information about their battery life, charging status, and the location of charging stations. EV manufacturers also use this data for a variety of purposes. For example, Tesla, one of the leading EV manufacturers, collects data from its vehicles and uses it to improve its Autopilot system. The company has also been able to detect and address issues with its vehicles through data collection. This has resulted in increased safety and improved customer satisfaction.Policymakers can also benefit from onboard electric vehicle data. By analyzing data on driving patterns and charging behavior, policymakers can better understand how to plan for and invest in charging infrastructure. This can help ensure that charging infrastructure is built in the locations where it is most needed and that it is accessible to all EV owners. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the government has used data on EV charging patterns to identify areas where additional charging infrastructure is needed. This has resulted in increased investment in charging infrastructure in areas where it was previously lacking, which has helped to reduce range anxiety and make EV ownership more convenient for consumers.Onboard vehicle data can help policymakers make more informed decisions about the policies and regulations that govern the use of EVs. For instance, data on driving patterns can inform policies that incentivize the use of EVs during times of low electricity demand. This can help reduce strain on the electricity grid and ensure that charging infrastructure is available when it is needed most.Furthermore, EVs can collect new types of data that have the potential to further accelerate the adoption of EVs. For example, many EVs are equipped with sensors that can detect road conditions and weather patterns. This data can be used to create more accurate models of driving behavior and to better predict charging needs.#electricvehicle#data#safety#evpolicy",0.9867,0.503030303030303,0,28,1 
Michael DeKort,01-03-2023,"Locomation shutting down operations by month's endJust like when Argo went under, this is a clear sign every trucking AV maker has been headed to bankruptcy from the beginning. Including Aurora, who recently made the shift to trucking to make development easier.Every bit of this is avoidable is the issues below are remedied. I talked to Locomation leadership several times trying to help them. They refused to make their simulation and AV engineers available to talk. This is another case of leadership, who is likley financially sound, choosing their ego over their employees and their families, admitting they had the development approach and simulation wrong and making the necessary changes. (I talked with Stirling Anderson at Aurora as well. He also refused to do the right thing.)- Nascent GL/AGI - which means no inference. Which leads to an untenable pattern recognition workload. (Deep learning). The alternative here is rules based development, not classifying objects or trying to establish their movements. Which this domain cannot do due to the complexity.- Use of human Guinea pigs, many of which have to literally be sacrificed to train/test many crash cases- Relying on the real-world vs simulation for most development and testing- Use of inadequate gaming simulation technology vs that from aerospace(I received a response that Locomation got in trouble due to their leader/follower approach. Yes, that made things worse.

bitsensing Inc.,01-03-2023,"Q: Why imaging radar?A: The biggest advantage of radar is that it can be used reliably in all weather and lighting conditions. On the other hand, Cameras and Lidar are very vulnerable in dense fog, snowstorms, bad weather, high exposure, and so on.If we look at the Tesla Autopilot accident in Taiwan in 2020, the Tesla, which was driving straight on a four-lane road, did not detect the overturned truck in front of it. The car was equipped with camera vision and 2D radar, but the camera vision could not distinguish the white coating of the truck from the sky and was not familiar with an overturned truck situation. With that, 2D radar cannot accurately detect height information, so it seems to have identified the truck as an overpass or sign that the vehicle could pass through. In other words, due to the limitations of vision-based judgment and 2D radar object recognition, it appears that the Autopilot system was not mature enough.4D imaging radar can detect the environment in 3D and measure 1D speed information, enabling more precise detection and differentiation of stationary objects that may cause collisions, moving individual objects, and height information. Moreover, 4D imaging radar delivers detection of various situations and related information of the driving environment, such as the remaining distance until a collision. If the Tesla car had been equipped with imaging radar, we could have avoided the accident back in 2020.The fact that Lidar and camera sensors become vulnerable in different environments is also a critical issue. Think about it. Self-driving car demos work well in good weather. However, these sensors are still not commercialized because of the limits in solving edge cases. And this we can overcome with imaging radar.Read more on the interview withbitsensing Inc.CEOJae-Eun Leeand Automotive Electronics magazine.https://lnkd.in/gyB-k9-k#radar#imagingradar#automotive",-0.8788,0.4658695652173913,0,26,1 
Code6,01-03-2023,"Tesla to build engineering HQ in California.Tesla is making California the home of its global engineering headquarters.CEO Elon Musk and California Governor Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that Tesla’s new engineering HQ will be at the former offices of Hewlett-Packard.The sudden rekindling of Tesla’s relationship with California may be surprising after the EV-maker up and moved its corporate headquarters from Fremont, California to Austin, Texas in 2021 after disputes with the state over COVID-19 restrictions. Musk has also repeatedly criticized California for being over-regulated and burdened with high taxes.However, Tesla has maintained operations of its first factory in Fremont, which still houses many engineers.Tesla tweeted that it’s hiring for new engineering roles in California, which would be a large part of the reason Newsom is backing the EV-maker’s investment back into the state. Sources told CNBC that the focus will be on engineers proficient in research development and artificial intelligence.“California prides itself on being on the leading and cutting edge of discovery and new ideas and innovation,” said Newsom, noting the state’s long relationship with Tesla. Newsom said he was excited to work with Tesla to both transform the automobile industry and reinforce California’s manufacturing dominance.Musk said the Fremont factory is expected to produce more than 600,000 vehicles this year.Tesla also said Wednesday that it will focus battery cell production in the United States to take advantage of federal incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act.Although Tesla is California’s most popular automaker, the company has a difficult relationship with the state. Tesla is being investigated by the federal equal employment agency and is still in the middle of a lawsuit from the state’s Civil Rights Department in regard to complaints from workers that the Fremont factory is rife with racial bias and harassment. The CA Department of Motor Vehicles has also accused Tesla of falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) advanced driver assistance systems.Tesla is expected to go further into details on the announcement on Wednesday during a scheduled livestream event.Tesla to build engineering HQ in California by Rebecca Bellan originally published on TechCrunchhttps://lnkd.in/d5bH3BRF",-0.6378,0.4721847041847042,0,0,0

Programming takes a new shape: 1) get good quality training data, a lot of it 2) set the objective and evaluation criteria 3) identify the neural net architecture (or search for it in some loosely defined space).So I read it, I think, in 2018 and ignorantly thought that although his ideas were curious there is no way we will get to Software 2.0 as fast as he was predicting.

Lidar is a technology that uses lasers to create high-resolution 3D maps of the surrounding environment. It is a crucial component in many autonomous vehicle systems, as it allows the vehicle to ""see"" and navigate the world around it.According to reports, GM is developing a solid-state lidar system, which uses micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to create the laser beams. This approach is said to be cheaper and more scalable than traditional lidar systems, which use spinning mirrors to create the laser beams.GM's lidar system is being developed in-house by a team of engineers at the company's Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. The goal is to create a lidar system that is reliable, cost-effective, and scalable for use in future GM vehicles.It's worth noting that GM is not the only company developing lidar systems.

A lot of folks are suddenly understanding what ""emergent properties leading to phase transitions in complex systems"" actually means, following the collapse ofSilicon Valley Bank.Financial markets, like public roads, are complex not complicated. Everything works fine, right up to the point at which it doesn't and then the system fails catastrophically. Financial markets are highly automated and sophisticated investors were early adopters of#AIand#DLto find a competitive trading edge. They forgot the lessons of#LTCMfrom 1998.We have just witnessed a phase transition in financial markets, as depositors panicked to remove their funds from#SVB, before the cash ran out. No AI/DL#algorithmcan help you when the bank has been shut down. It took humans (Central Bankers) to decide what to do next and move things forward, but we are at the beginning not the end of the next banking saga.#Autonomousdrivingoffers a similar illusion to financial markets. It looks really easy most of the time, until everything goes wrong at once, and then AI/DL can't help you. It needs human intervention and ingenuity to resolve a problem and get things moving again, until the next snarl up that is.  That is what we see in San Francisco with Cruise and Waymo#robotaxisnafus on an almost daily basis.Taking humans out of the driving loop altogether is like taking central bankers out of the financial system. It wasn't machines that could demonstrate judgment under uncertainty and create a way forward with SVB, it was people.Ironically the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank shines a spotlight onto the autonomous developers, and their messages of taking humans out of the driving loop. Some of those companies will remain in business this month simply because of the actions of humans, but longer term it raises the question of the wisdom of replacing humans as drivers.#ChatGPTis fun.

Kevin Cohee,13-03-2023,"💓this New Uber Feature- though not as much an Uber fan vs. LyftWhat's happening:Uber recently announced that it's adding step-by-step instructions within its app to navigate travelers from the plane to their Uber pickup zone.The handy feature — which will include directions and accompanying photos — will be available at more than 30 airports worldwide to start, including San Francisco International Airport.Why it matters:Trips to and from the airport represent around 15% of Uber's total rideshare bookings. And with competition emerging from driverless services like Waymo and Cruise, the company will need to continue to hone its user experience to maintain a foothold in the market.Details:As part of the announcement, Uber also said it'll soon roll out ""walking ETAs"" at more than 400 airports, so travelers can more accurately know when to call for a ride and cut down on their wait times.Excerpt from: Axios San Franciscohttps://lnkd.in/gE4aQ5V2#rideshare#easytravel",0.4576,0.4480639730639731,0,5,2

"Wayne Harriman CISSP, CISM, AWS Solutions Architect",13-03-2023,"For those who do not live in a city with autonomous cars:I live in San Francisco where they have been test driving autonomous cars for what seems like forever. About 10 days ago I noticed a change. There are no longer anyone in the driver’s seat. Waymo cars and an occasional Cruize are taking themselves out and about at all times of the day…during rush hour, while young school kids are crossing the street and all other hours of the day.They pick up someone who has called them via an app as part of their new driverless pilot program.So far I am totally impressed. For years I have worried about this day. When I walk across a crosswalk, I always make eye contact with the driver. I want that assurance that they see me. Drivers in SF do not like stopping at crosswalks, even when there is a stop sign.How would I know that an autonomous car is aware of me before I walk in front of it. Will it wink at me, flash it’s lights?So, when I first walked in front of one while on a crosswalk, I was a bit anxious. Not only did it patiently wait, fully behind the crosswalk, it did not get distracted while a seemingly street person attacked it…trying to enter the locked doors, then screaming at it and pounding on it.After I crossed, it drove on.90% of my autonomous vehicle observations have been Waymo. I give them an A++++Replacing human drivers with autonomous vehicles may be the ticket to zero pedestrian deaths that SF has wanted to achieve",0.0959,0.5914673046251991,0,15,0

Thankfully no injuries indicated in any of these reports.Takeaways: These reports are a sign that these companies are honoring reporting requirements. They do not indicate these vehicles are more or less safe than human drivers because we lack the number of miles driven. And this might just have been a bad month. But this should make it clear that crashes are expected to happen during testing, and any state that does not require crash reporting is basically closing its eyes and ignoring the impact of such testing on other road users. (Blame is not the point here. A crash is a crash. If we did have crash rate data, an elevated crash rate data is a problem regardless of assigned blame. If crash rates were lower, that would be a win for automation. But the companies aren't providing data in a way we can assess that, so it would be ill-advised to assume they are at this point safer than human drivers.)Kudos to California for requiring collision reports, providing a level of transparency. Also, while one could always want more information, these reports were reasonably factual accounts without the blame/spin we've come to expect from other companies operating there.https://lnkd.in/eAWerMVQ",-0.9922,0.3799908424908425,23 ,134,5

Robotaxis are essentially autonomous taxis that operate without the need for a human driver. The industry for robotaxis is expected to#growsignificantly in the coming years as more companies invest in autonomous vehicle technology and as consumers become more comfortable with the idea of riding in self-driving vehicles.The growth of the robotaxi industry is influenced by the rising#demandfor ride-hailing services, high R&D investments, and government focus on reducing emissions, infrastructure development, and growth of the electrification of vehicles. One of the main benefits of robotaxis is that they have the potential to greatly reduce the cost of transportation, since there is no need to pay a human driver. This could make transportation more accessible and affordable for people in many parts of the world.Rapid testing of autonomous vehicles, presence of numerous technology providers and ride-hailing companies and plans to deploy robotaxi fleets for mass usage are the key factors driving the industry in China. The Asia Pacific region comprises emerging economies such as China and India, along with developed nations such as Japan, and is the#largestindustry for automotive. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and availability of infrastructure are expected to lead to the increasing deployment of robotaxis.The Robotaxi Industry is projected to grow from 617 units in 2021 to reach 1,445,822 units by 2030, at a#CAGRof 136.8%.𝑲𝒆𝒚 𝑷𝒍𝒂𝒚𝒆𝒓𝒔-Waymo,Cruise,Baidu, Inc.,AutoX,Tesla#robotaxi#autonomousvehicles#selfdrivingcars#TransportationRevolution#futureofmobility#UrbanTransportation#mobilityasaservice#artificialintelligence#smartcities#InnovationInTransportation",0.8439,0.5317424242424242,0,0,0
Rudy Moenaert,10-03-2023,"THE BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMSHet leest als een who's who van ambitieuze dromen en harde landingen:- Alexa (Amazon)- Fire Phone (Amazon)- Google Glass (Alphabet)- Waymo (Alphabet)- Metaverse (Meta) (Ja hoor, plaats die ook maar in het rijtje)Ik zou kunnen zeggen - ""I told you so long ago."" Het is niet dat ik niet van innovatie hou. De ondraaglijke saaiheid van het normale trok me nooit aan. Innovatie is bovendien de focus geweest van een groot deel van mijn academische carrière. Maar simpele journalisten, egotrippers die hun naam in neon letters op Mars willen hebben, managers met een overschot aan geld en een tekort aan technisch vernuft, en een goede hypemachine voor de nieuwe technologieën dragen ertoe bij dat de samenleving telkens opnieuw vergeet dat innovatie véél trager gaat dan gedacht. Iedere degelijk wetenschappelijk onderbouwde studie van innovatie en technologische vooruitgang zal tonen dat innovatie langer duurt dan gedacht, de ontgoochelingen veel groter zijn dan geanticipeerd, en de ontnuchterende zelfreflecties veel talrijker vooraf ingeschat.De redenen zijn eenvoudig - enerzijds is de vernieuwing technologische uitdagend en anderzijds verloopt de adoptie ervan vermoeiend traag. Innovatie vereist immers gedragsverandering, en dat is iets wat het merendeel van de mensen niet echt leuk vindt. In de woorden van Lester Thurow - ""Sociology always beats technology, but eventually sociology changes."" Dat het veranderen van die 'sociologie' zeer traag gebeurt, vergeet men al te vaak.  In de woorden van Paul Ormerod - ""Most experiments fail."" Bon, hoe waar dit ook is, met dergelijk fatalisme komen we ook niet bij een betere wereld, natuurlijk. It spoils the fun big time.Het is natuurlijk ambigu - het zijn de gekke projecten die de wereld vooruitbranden. En dus moeten we af en toe geloven dat die radicale innovatie zal lukken. Maar dat is precies de essentie van 'geloof' - meegaan in een gedachtegoed zonder dat er empirisch bewijs is dat het écht goed komt. De Ongelovige Thomas is een rolmodel dat iets meer mag worden gewaardeerd in de huidige techgekte. Eind januari tankte ik mijn Q5 (diesel) vol in Kitzbühel, en ik reed zonder bijtanken 1000 km huiswaarts. Zal mijn volgende wagen elektrisch zal zijn? Geloof ik dat er snel een elektrische wagen zal zijn van pakweg €45.000, die er niet belachelijk uitziet, en die écht een actieradius van >800km heeft?

"Stanimir ""Stan"" Sotirov",10-03-2023,"The Future of the Automotive Industry: From Self-Driving Cars to Flying VehiclesThe automotive industry has come a long way since the first automobiles were introduced in the late 19th century. Today, we are on the brink of a new era in transportation, where autonomous vehicles and flying cars are becoming a reality. In this post, we'll explore what the future of the automotive industry might look like and what it means for the way we move.> Self-Driving CarsSelf-driving cars have been a hot topic for years, with companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Uber racing to develop the technology that will make them a reality. While there are still some hurdles to overcome, such as regulatory challenges and public trust, experts predict that self-driving cars will be on the roads in the near future. Self-driving cars have the potential to reduce accidents caused by human error, improve traffic flow, and increase accessibility for people who are unable to drive themselves.> Electric VehiclesElectric vehicles (EVs) are already on the roads, but they still only make up a small fraction of the total number of cars on the road. However, with advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure, EVs are becoming more practical and affordable for everyday consumers. Governments around the world are also incentivizing the purchase of EVs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. It's likely that we'll see a significant increase in the number of EVs on the roads in the coming years.> Flying CarsWhile it may seem like something out of science fiction, the idea of flying cars has been around for decades. In recent years, advancements in technology have made the idea more feasible than ever before. Companies like Uber and Airbus are already testing prototypes of flying cars, and experts predict that they could be a reality within the next decade. Flying cars would provide a new mode of transportation that could bypass traffic on the ground, but they would also require new infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to be put in place.The future of the automotive industry is exciting and full of possibilities. From self-driving cars to flying vehicles, we are on the cusp of a transportation revolution. However, there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory hurdles and public perception. As technology continues to advance, it will be interesting to see how the industry evolves and what new innovations will be introduced.#future#technology#climatechange#infrastructure#transportation#cars#science",0.9707,0.49332912457912453,0,2,0
フジアルテ株式会社,10-03-2023,"～世界自動運転技術ランキングとは　テスラが最下位！？～自動運転という言葉を耳にする機会が多いですが、皆さんは世界自動運転技術ランキングをご存知ですか？アメリカの市場調査会社「Guidehouse Insights(ガイドハウス・インサイツ)」が発表する自動運転システムを開発する大手企業16社のランキングです。このランキングでは、「実行性」と「戦略性」を軸に評価を行い、各社を上から「リーダー」「競争者」「追随者」に分類しています。このランキングによると、「リーダー」に分類された企業は以下の通り4社あります。1位：インテル傘下の自動運転技術開発企業「Mobileye(モービルアイ)」2位：米グーグル系の自動運転開発企業「Waymo（ウェイモ）」3位：中国インターネット大手の百度（バイドゥ）傘下の自動運転事業「百度Apollo（バイドゥアポロ）」4位：米ゼネラル・モーターズ傘下の「Cruise（クルーズ）」アメリカの企業が上位を占める中、「リーダー」に分類された唯一の中国企業である3位のバイドゥは今回で3年連続「リーダー」に分類されています。最新のAI技術で有名なバイドゥですが、2022年に運転手不要の完全自動運転タクシーのサービスを開始したことで注目を浴びました。そして、最下位はなんとアメリカの電気自動車大手であるテスラです！テスラは2月16日に完全な自動運転として数年前からオプション販売していた「フルセルフドライビング ケイパビリティ」という機能がドライバーを危険に晒すとし、この機能を搭載した約36万3,000台すべてをリコールする旨を発表しました。今回のリコールにより、テスラの運転支援技術の本質的な課題が浮き彫りになったとの声があがっています。日本では2023年4月1日に道路交通法が改正され、レベル4の公道走行が解禁されます。レベル4の解禁により、一定の条件を満たした領域内に限り完全な自動運転走行が可能になることで今後ますます自動運転技術の進化が期待されます！#自動運転#世界自動運転技術ランキング#テスラ#百度#Mobileye#Waymo#Cruise#レベル４#経済#自動車#製造#派遣#フジアルテ",0.0,0.0,0,0,0

Lennart Dobravsky,09-03-2023,"When talking about the great strides in mobility innovation, we can’t ignore the elephant in the room, autonomous vehicles.Let’s call it what it is: According to many projections by startup founders and futurists in the past, WE SHOULD ALL HAVE BEEN CRUISING AROUND IN SELF-DRIVING CARS BY NOW.🔮While this future was anticipated to arrive by the early 2020s, we are significantly off track from realizing autonomous vehicles as a mainstream part of daily life on public roads anytime soon.💥Instead, what’s happening is a brutal shakedown among hyped-up companies, all of which are trying to bring the technology to life. As of early 2023, it appears that only two of the top companies, Alphabet’sWaymoandCruise, are still pressing ahead.Does this mean autonomous vehicles will never come to life?No, not all. But for now, autonomous vehicles have only become commercially relevant in so-called protected environments, according toUP.Partners#MovingWorldReport.Three examples:Teleo, which turns construction equipment into “supervised” autonomous robots. One operator remotely controls two or more pieces of heavy equipment simultaneously.Vaywhich offers a teledrive-first approach to autonomous driving by enabling a person (“the teledriver”) to control a vehicle remotely (“teledriving”) while gradually introducing more autonomous driving functionalities.Amazon Global Roboticswhich has deployed more than 520,000 robotic drive units across its fulfillment and sort centers. Most recently, Amazon presented Proteus, which is an autonomous floor system that helps with the lifting and movement of cargo carts.Source:https://lnkd.in/eTqw8H4H#innovation#technology#startups#mobility#trends#future#autonomousvehicles#robotics#construction#cars",0.8614,0.5060049019607842,2 ,15,1

STEMex Academy,09-03-2023,Waymo最近在美國加州境內獲准提供自駕車服務，並在舊金山進行測試與服務運作，雖然比起競爭同業Curise走得比較慢，但還是值得了解一下Google 這家公司。#Waymo是做什麼的？Waymo專注於開發自動駕駛汽車和自動駕駛汽車技術。是Google旗下的子公司。現在使用的自動駕駛技術都由Waymo自行研發，包括傳感器、攝像頭和 LiDAR，以及使其車輛能夠在道路上導航和做出駕駛決策的 AI 算法。#Waymo的歷史和由來？Waymo 最初是谷歌內部的一個項目，由工程師 Sebastian Thrun 和 Chris Urmson 於 2009 年啟動。 目標是開發使汽車能夠自動駕駛的技術，最終目的是減少人為錯誤造成的事故。 2016 年，Waymo成為谷歌母公司 Alphabet 旗下的一家獨立公司。 從那以後，Waymo 繼續開發其技術，並一直在亞利桑那州鳳凰城等城市對其自動駕駛汽車進行公開試驗。#自動駕駛技術會如何改變世界？Waymo 的技術有可能以多種方式徹底改變交通。自動駕駛汽車能提高駕駛效率，減少交通擁堵，使道路更安全，同時使無法駕駛的人士（例如老年人或殘疾人）出行更便捷。 Waymo的技術也被用於物流行業，以開發自動駕駛卡車，這有助於降低運輸成本並提高效率，也減低司機因長途駕駛而導致車禍發生的問題。#世界對Waymo有什麼期望？Waymo正在繼續開發其技術並擴大其業務。在過去幾年，與Uber、Volvo和Jaguar等主要汽車產業相關的企業建立了合作夥伴關係，並一直在多個城市對其自動駕駛汽車進行公開試驗。 在未來幾年，可以期待看到更多的自動駕駛汽車上路，更多的公司採用自動駕駛汽車技術。 Waymo可能會繼續在消費者和商業領域向自主交通的轉變中發揮重要作用。,0.0,0.0,0,1,0

Nitin Chopra,09-03-2023,"""Connected, Autonomous, Shared, and Electric (CASE)"" refers to the four major technological trends shaping the future of the automotive industry.The increasing connectivity of cars allows them to communicate with other cars, infrastructure, and even the internet. This enables various features such as real-time traffic information, remote diagnostics, and over-the-air software updates.Autonomous driving technology allows vehicles to operate without human input, using sensors and advanced algorithms to navigate roads safely. This technology promises to improve safety, reduce congestion, and enhance mobility for people who cannot drive, such as the elderly and disabled.Shared mobility refers to the use of vehicles on a pay-per-use or subscription basis, rather than individual ownership. This includes ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, car-sharing services like Zipcar, and even public transportation systems.Electric vehicles (EVs) use batteries and electric motors to power the car, rather than gasoline engines. This technology promises to reduce emissions, lower operating costs, and enhance performance.Collectively, these four trends are driving major changes in the automotive industry and are expected to shape the future of transportation. The term ""CASE"" is often used to describe these trends because they are seen as interrelated and mutually reinforcing.Follow me for more interesting technology facts.

ichu peng,09-03-2023,2023 年下半年（及以后）#我最想购买的股票2023 年 3 月 8 日上午 6:18Alphabet 遭到重创，股价比高点低 40%。这个占主导地位的行业领导者仍有很大的增长潜力。目前，大多数 FAANG 股票都有充分的理由。 仅举几个例子，亚马逊的交易价格不到其近期峰值的一半，而 Netflix 最近报告的订户数量大大好于分析师的预期。然而，随着我们进入春季，在利率和通胀仍然高企且经济不确定性持续存在的情况下，有一只 FAANG 股票看起来像是一个特别强大的长期机会：谷歌母公司 Alphabet (GOOGL 0.80%) (GOOG 0.71%)。 该公司提供了罕见的成熟度、盈利能力和增长潜力的组合，股价从高点下跌了约 40%，对于耐心的投资者来说，这似乎是一笔划算的交易。具有成熟和增长潜力的核心业务Alphabet 大约 90% 的收入来自谷歌服务，公平地说，这是一系列相对成熟的广告驱动型业务。 占主导地位的谷歌搜索平台是最大的组成部分，但这还包括 YouTube、Gmail、Android、Chrome、地图和其他流行的面向消费者的平台。纳斯达克：#GOOGL(0.80%) 0.75 美元时价 94.61 美元这方面的业务可能仍有巨大的增长潜力，但在未来几年不太可能发生。 然而，谷歌服务是一系列坚如磐石的主导业务，可产生可靠的高利润收入流。另一方面，目前约占公司收入 10% 的 Google Cloud 可能成为未来几年的主要增长动力。 它提供业务协作工具、云存储、数据库服务、内容分发网络 (CDN)、人工智能和机器学习工具、应用程序平台等等。 总之，Google Cloud 提供了 150 多种不同的产品。目前，谷歌云在该业务中所占比例相对较小，但未来几年可能会发生变化。 一方面，云计算是公司增长最快的部分，第四季度收入同比增长 32%。 它是最近几个季度在云基础设施市场中获得重要份额的三大云提供商中唯一的一家（亚马逊的 AWS 和微软的 Azure 是领导者）。不仅如此，云市场本身也在迅速扩张。 到 2022 年，云计算市场的规模估计为 4840 亿美元，但预计到 2030 年将增长两倍以上，达到 1.55 万亿美元的机会。 如果谷歌云能够增加其市场份额，这最终可能成为一个巨大的增长动力。Alphabet 目前是我最喜欢的 FAANG 股票还有其他一些原因。  “其他赌注”部分目前没有产生太多收入，但未来可能会发生变化。  Waymo 自动驾驶汽车初创公司尤其有前途，但在医疗保健和人工智能等行业也有一些初创公司。 需要明确的是，即使这些业务一无所获，我也会购买 Alphabet——但这是对这家科技巨头未来潜力的一个很好的补充。 而且它也不会将公司的收购潜力限制在适合谷歌服务和云领域的组织。最后，重要的是要考虑 Alphabet 出色的财务状况。 该公司的资产负债表上有大约 1400 亿美元的现金和证券，这赋予了它巨大的财务灵活性，尤其是考虑到它仅在过去四个季度就产生了近 600 亿美元的净收入。  Alphabet 可以为收购机会提供资金，对创新进行再投资，或者在它认为合适的时候机会主义地回购股票,0.0,0.0,0,0,0

Seitdem OpenAI die Maschine per API zur Verfügung stellt, kann jedes Unternehmen für kleines Geld ChatGPT-Anwendungen bauen - und immer mehr Unternehmen nutzen das Tool fürs Coden, Texte schreiben, Roboter zu steuern oder Zusammenfassungen zu erstellen. Interessant ist auch, wie OpenAI seine KI-Wizards von der Konkurrenz abwirbt, zum Beispiel sein Superhirn Mira Murati, die früher für Tesla das Model X entwickelt hat.• Während die neue KI eine weltweite Begeisterung auslöst, zeigt sich, dass Deutschlands Digitalisierung im vergangenen Jahr kaum vorangekommen ist.

Jason McNabb,08-03-2023,"I have been remarkably blessed over the last 10+ years to be at the very forefront of technology as it has grown to be SO impactful in both our personal and professional lives. I was on the launch pad with Uber Technologies when Uber was still determining what it wanted to be as a company. When industry terms such as SaaS and TaaS had yet to be made popular. In fact, I remember not being allowed to use SaaS as a term at all when communicating with customers or partners because it was considered ""lingo"". Now, it's an every day term. I was with Waymo/Google (contracted, of course) as an operations specialist assisting in teaching autonomous vehicles how to drive completely on their own. In those years it was outstanding to see these vehicles go from stopping and asking more questions than a two year old while attempting to navigate its way through dynamic/real life scenarios (referred to as an alert) - to being able to make extremely impressive judgement calls - on its own and in mere seconds, or less, of that event occurring. I look forward to being able to point to one of those vehicles one day with my son and sharing with him that his old man was a part of that journey.Now, AI has stepped into the forefront of everyone's mind and is moving from sci-fi to sci-real. A thought that is both fascinating AND a little nerve-racking. On one side when you hear the term AI you may think SkyNet, Hal, and Project Eagle Eye. On the other, more pragmatic side, you may think JARVIS or Bladerunner. My career has been on the forefront of technology, but my education - my foundation - was and continues to be centered on the Human Element. Psychology. So I am constantly considering how these two worlds collide and the impact they have when they do. It can be absolutely empowering when these two worlds collaborate and work with each other in ways that launch us forward. BUT, it can also be soul-crushing to hear that AI has been implemented in some cases as a total replacement for the Human Element. To that effect the question becomes rather simple - When does AI become less of a TOOL, and more like a CRUTCH?LinkedIn is venturing into this field in a way that I find to be an interesting manner worthy of exploring. AI and industry professionals collaborating to share knowledge, experience, and time-tested/real life industry wisdom in an engaging way. Personally, I believe this to be a great example of how AI can be utilized as a TOOL for both professional and personal growth.#ai#career#technology#linkedin#TheHumanElement#leadership#management#professionalgrowth#woosender",0.9898,0.5113530778164925,6 ,0,0

Rob Curley,08-03-2023,"I'm not a fanboy ofTeslabut I love it when an ambition has a plan...At their investor day last week they lifted the lid on how big improvements in production will benefit both customers & themselves.He's the roadmap on how production costs will be halved over the next 5 years:1. Tesla will produce 100% of the controllers on its next generation vehicle. Gaining greater control of its supply chain.2.  It will switch to a 48-volt battery architecture that should reduce power losses by 16-fold. Unclear on if this will result on improved range for the consumer or a downscaling of the battery size, lets see! (Not an engineer so please don't go hard on me there!)3.  Tesla will use local ethernet-connected controllers to reduce the complexity of the wiring harness. These electrical architecture changes should cut costs and give Tesla more control over its supply chain at the component level.These improvements will enable Tesla to transition its manufacturing to a parallel assembly process, slashing its manufacturing footprint and wasted time by 40% and 30%, respectively.Last of all, there is clearly a race for the self driving vehicle economy afoot. The likesGoogle,Uber,Lyftand the major car brands are racing to capitalise on this nascent market. So what is Tesla doing to get ahead?Tesla’s fleet currently drives more than 120 million miles per day in total and ~100 million in full self-driving (FSD) with its most advanced driver assistance. In contrast, Cruise and Waymo each has attained one million miles driven cumulatively with no one behind the wheel on public roads. While not a perfect comparison, relative to its autonomous driving competition, Tesla vehicles have traveled ~100X the cumulative miles and have collected ~50,000X the dataAll credit goes for this content goes to ARK Invest's news letter.

Erst vor ein paar Tagen hat mir ein Freund erzählt, der beruflich in Phoenix/Arizona war, dass sein Kollege ihm ein WAYMO bestellt hat, ein Robotertaxi, das#autonommit  Level-4-Technologie fährt, vollends fahrerlos. Das#robotaxisieht ziemlich normal aus, eingebaut ist die Technik in Chrysler Minivans und in den Jaguar I-PACE electric. Mission von Waymo ist, Verkehrsunfälle zu verhindern, denn 94% dieser Unfälle passieren durch menschliche Fehler. Mittlerweile sind die Robotaxis in einigen US-Städten erlaubt, Start und Ziel müssen innerhalb fixierter Gebiete erfolgen. Also rollen diese fahrenden Computer schon auf den Straßen. Aber das ist nicht alles: Im nächsten Schritt soll, mit WAYMO Via, der Gütertransport autonom erfolgen.Klar gibt es noch manchmal Probleme, so hat ein#robotaxivon Cruise, einem weiteren Anbieter in den USA, im Herbst einen Unfall ausgelöst, weil das Fahrzeug bremste und nicht abbog, als ein entgegenkommendes Auto zu weit rechts fuhr. Außerdem kam es einmal zu einem Stau, weil mehrere Fahrzeuge aufgrund eines Softwareproblems mitten auf einer Hauptstraße stehen blieben.Was heißt das nun konkret? Autos mit leistungsfähigeren Sensoren, gleichzeitig ein mehr an Hochleistungscomputern in den Fahrzeugen und mehr Nachfrage nach Halbleitern. Noch macht Cruise hohe Verluste, aber die eingesetzten Komponenten werden immer günstiger. LiDAR, eine Technik zu Abstands-, Geschwindigkeits- und Fernmessung, ist in letzter Zeit stark im Preis gesunken, und seine Akzeptanz nimmt zu. Das ist, wie Insider wissen, ein Schlüsselfaktor, denn LiDAR wird auch für Fahrzeuge von auf Level-3 fahrende autonome Fahrzeuge eingesetzt und bringt weitere Sicherheitsvorteile. In China will Jidu, eine Geely-Tochter bereits heuer  damit starten, das autonome#elektroautoRobo-01 für den Massenmarkt zu produzieren.  In Europa stehen mehrere Modellprojekte in den Startlöchern. All das zeigt auf: Autonomes Fahren ist nicht mehr aufzuhalten, auch wenn es noch etliche gesetzliche Änderungen geben muss, die sicherlich gerade in Europa noch genug Zeit in Anspruch nehmen.#technologie#autonomesfahren#robotaxi#mobility",-0.9661,0.625,1 ,21,3

Max Del Rosso,08-03-2023,"🔥 [TEST] IL RIVALE DI CHATGPTHo testato Claude, l’AI di Anthropic, la società in cui Google ha recentemente investito 300 mln di dollari.A mio parere, qualità ottima. Ecco l’articolo:Il futuro è elettrico: come le auto elettriche stanno ridisegnando il domaniAuto a guida autonoma, condivise e sostenibili, le auto elettriche stanno accelerando verso il domani. Secondo gli esperti del settore, progressi nella tecnologia dei veicoli elettrici (VE), insieme a tendenze nella proprietà delle automobili, mostrano che i VE potrebbero presto dominare le strade.""Stanno avvenendo enormi progressi, da nuove tecniche di produzione a maggiore autonomia e più stazioni di ricarica"", afferma l'esperta dell'associazione CALSTART Susan Harris. Harris vede una convergenza tra VE e tecnologia di guida autonoma, specialmente nelle applicazioni di flotte e ride-sharing. ""La crescita di veicoli elettrici autonomi in flotte permetterà di ottimizzare le rotte e aumentare efficienza e convenienza"", dice.La società di previsioni IHS Markit prevede oltre 300 milioni di veicoli elettrici sulle strade globali entro il 2040. Un'infrastruttura elettrica in crescita, veicoli via via più accessibili e incentivi governativi potrebbero accelerare questa rivoluzione. Sarà possibile scegliere tra un'ampia gamma di VE per tipologia ed esigenza, dalle utilitarie alle auto di lusso.Nel presente, la Cina ospita quasi la metà di tutti i VE attualmente circolanti, sostenuta da ingenti investimenti governativi per combattere l'inquinamento. Anche in Europa la diffusione di VE è in rapida crescita, con alcuni Paesi - come Norvegia e Olanda - che mirano ad abolire auto a benzina e diesel entro il 2025. Rispetto a modelli pre-pandemici, la crisi COVID-19 potrebbe accelerare la transizione verso l'adozione di VE, con più persone che preferiscono evitare mezzi pubblici in favore di soluzioni di micromobilità individuale.Protagonisti di questa rivoluzione sono nuove aziende come Tesla e NIO, oltre a big player tradizionali come Volkswagen e Volvo. Crescono anche realtà focalizzate su tecnologie di guida autonoma, come Waymo, che si fondono con l'avanzamento dei VE: si prevede che entro 10-15 anni flotte hi-tech di VE senza conducente debutteranno in servizi di ride-sharing su strade selezionate.Un futuro ""full electric"" promette benefici ambientali, economici e di mobilità. I VE non emettono gas di scarico, riducendo inquinamento e dipendenza da petrolio. Costi di gestione inferiori e prezzi in picchiata ne abbasseranno accessibilità, destinati a diventare più convenienti di auto tradizionali. Nuove forme di sharing mobility potrebbero democratizzare la mobilità, con tutti che potranno permettersi di spostarsi in modo sostenibile. Restano sfide nell'aumentare infrastrutture e nell'incentivare l'adozione tra consumatori, ma con tecnologia e supporto che crescono a ritmo accelerato, auto elettriche ad alta tecnologia ci si profilano come il futuro che già bussa alle nostre porte.",0.6369,0.325,2 ,13,1

Jacob Simon,08-03-2023,"It’s 2023 and the future has finally arrived! Last night, I had my first self-driving taxi ride withCruisein San Francisco. Here’s my honest take on the experience:It feels like fully autonomous (Level 4) cars have been “almost here” for as long as I can remember. If you live in SF, you’ve seen self-driving cars from Cruise, Waymo, and Zoox being tested on the roads for the last decade but, until now, they haven’t been publicly available in any real capacity. Finally, last week, I received the notification that I’d made it off Cruise’s waitlist.As the saying goes, the “future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed.”Cruise’s app is a spitting image of Uber or Lyft, with an uncannily similar UX where you can select your pickup point and destination. You can preview the route your car will take and estimated time of arrival. Right now, however, there’s a few important limitations with Cruise:🕘 Hours of operation: These cars are only available from 10PM - 5AM. Presumably that’s to avoid traffic and minimize risk to other drivers.🗺️ Service area: Cruise is only operating in a limited portion of the city right now. I don’t know if that’s because some neighborhoods are harder to navigate or if it’s to minimize the distance they can travel.Our home is located in a confusing cul-de-sac on Telegraph Hill just outside the service area, soSonia Xuand I walked a few minutes into Chinatown and set our pickup location around there.Shortly after, we were assigned our driver, Eggs Benedict. We watched the app as our autonomous driver homed in on our location and then appeared around the corner.But then something a little weird happened. The car kept driving and didn’t stop! The app told us we only had 4 minutes to claim our ride, so in an unexpected turn of events, we started chasing Eggs Benedict down the street. Luckily it stopped just a couple blocks away.Aside from that rough start, the rest of the experience was smooth sailing. We got in the car, buckled up, and then were off. The experience of being driven through San Francisco without a driver was magical and trippy to say the least.That’s not to say our twenty minute ride was without obstacles and challenges. To start with, it was raining lightly during most of our trip, which is known to interfere with LiDAR sensors. We also encountered cars blocking the road, jaywalking pedestrians, and more. Benny navigated them without breaking a sweat.That said, there have been numerous reports of driverless cars blocking intersections and causing traffic jams the last few months. In terms of safety, I personally never felt at risk. On the contrary, our car was definitely taking its time and seemed to be avoiding the main streets in favor of quieter routes, so don’t use this if time is of the essence.In the end, it didn’t feel much different from any other ride—in a good way.What do you think? Are self-driving cars here to stay?#tech#artificialintelligence",-0.4787,0.4663968253968255,5 ,48,0

Cezar Taurion,08-03-2023,"Com a crescente pressão por mais resultados e eficiência, e menos dinheiro de investidores, parece que as BigTechs, que se destacavam, na época do dinheiro fácil, em serem inovadoras, com projetos “moon shots” estão mudando, tornando-se mais e mais parecidas com as grandes e tradicionais corporações das quais tanto queriam se diferenciar. Os projetos paralelos de grandes ideias que deveriam se tornar os geradores de receita do futuro foram particularmente atingidos, com alguns deles sendo completamente desmantelados e outros enfrentando profundos cortes nos investimentos.Oito anos atrás, o Google dividiu a empresa em entidades separadas e batizaram a coleção de Alphabet. A ideia era separar o negócio principal, sua gigantesca máquina de publicidade que a tornou uma das corporações mais poderosas do mundo, dos projetos paralelos que precisavam de tempo para se desenvolver, mas que um dia poderiam se tornar o próximo grande gerador de dinheiro do Google. Mas isso não se materializou. A receita ainda vem predominantemente da publicidade. O Google desativou a maioria de seus chamados “moon shots”, de balões de conexão de internet a lentes de contato de medição de glicose. E até mesmo os mais avançados de seus projetos paralelos, os carros autônomos Waymo e a start-up de tecnologia de saúde Verily, perderam tração. A Área 120, uma parte do Google que servia como uma “incubadora” interna de startups, perdeu a maior parte de seus funcionários e em breve será totalmente fechada. O departamento representava uma das peculiaridades do Google, permitir que alguns funcionários dedicassem tempo a projetos fora de suas tarefas regulares e até mesmo permanecessem na empresa às vezes para lançar startups, em vez de sair e fazer isso por conta própria.Em outubro, um mês antes de anunciar demissões generalizadas, a Amazon começou a desmantelar sua incubadora interna, a Grand Challenge. A equipe trabalhou em projetos como Echo Frames, tentativa da Amazon em óculos inteligentes e até pesquisas sobre o câncer. Em outubro, um mês antes de anunciar demissões generalizadas, a Amazon começou a encerrar sua incubadora interna exploratória, a Grand Challenge. A equipe trabalhou em projetos como Echo Frames, facada da Amazon em óculos inteligentes e até pesquisas sobre o câncer, informou a CNBC pela primeira vez em 2018. O líder da equipe Babak Parviz, que veio do Google X em 2014, deixou a Amazon em outubro. Sua saída foi seguida por notícias de que a maioria dos projetos do grupo seria encerrada, incluindo o Amazon Glow e o Amazon Explore, um produto de turismo virtual. O Amazon Care, que a empresa fechou em agosto, também foi um produto do Grand Challenge. Em vez de continuar a apoiar esse projeto, a Amazon adquiriu a start-up One Medical.

Nilesh Sharma,08-03-2023,"Did you know that Google's self-driving car program,#waymo, started as a side project by two Google employees during their 20% time?In the early days of#google, the company had a policy that allowed employees to spend 20% of their time working on projects outside of their official job duties. This led to the creation of several iconic Google products, such as Gmail and Google News, but it also led to some more unusual projects.One such project was a self-driving car, which initially faced skepticism from many within the company. However, the two employees continued to work on their project during their 20% time and eventually built a small fleet of self-driving cars that could navigate city streets.Their work caught the attention of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who saw potential in the technology for Google's mapping and navigation products. In 2009, Google began testing their self-driving cars on public roads, and in 2012, they launched a fully self-driving car program that eventually became Waymo.The lesson? Encouraging employees to pursue#sideprojectsand experiment with new ideas can lead to innovative breakthroughs that can change entire industries. So if you're a manager or leader, consider adopting a similar policy of allowing employees to spend a portion of their time pursuing passion projects.

Dr. Jeffrey Funk,08-03-2023,"Google, Amazon, and Meta have shuttered most of their moonshots and revenue still mostly comes from their core businesses: advertising for Google and Meta, and e-commerce and cloud services for Amazon.When Google went public in 2004, its founders warned investors not to expect the quarterly focus that most public companies are forced to heed. They set up Google X, to develop the weirdest and riskiest ideas, and told their employees they should spend part of their time on projects completely unrelated to their day jobs. “Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one,” they said.Eight years ago, Google’s founders changed its name to Alphabet to separate the core advertising business from the side projects that it began with Google X, more than 200 by one count including: Google Glass, Project Loon, Sidewalk Labs, Hangouts, and Picasa.The next big moneymaker hasn’t yet materialized and even the most advanced of its side projects –self-driving car lab Waymo, health-care Verily, -- are now doing little. Waymo laid off 8% of its workforce in February, adding to a previous round of cuts in January. Verily laid off 15% of its staff. Area 120, a part of Google that served as an internal start-up “incubator,” lost most of its employees and will soon be completely shut down.Amazon is doing the same. It began winding down its exploratory internal incubator, Grand Challenge, which worked on projects like Echo Frames, Amazon’s stab at smart glasses and phones (Fire), and even cancer research,In 2013, Bezos said that#Amazonwas testing delivery by drone. But 10 years later, Amazon’s drone operation has made few real-world deliveries.Facebook parent Meta is also still focused on its core business of social media and advertising. Despite investing billions into its long-term gamble to build out immersive digital realms known as the#metaverse, the uptake by users has been slow including the use of#VRand#ARpowered services. Zuckerberg has been forced to refocus his existing employees on the company’s top business objectives in the face of falling revenue and an uncertain economic future.Giving up the moonshot dream marks another stage in the companies’ march into middle age.#Google,#Facebookand Amazon all grew rapidly through the first two decades of the millennium through their focus on new business that they still dominate.The biggest#techcompanies have indeed managed to avoid disruption. But it wasn’t through reinventing themselves with internally created big ideas and the small expansions they did achieve came through acquisitions: Google’s Android operating system, Facebook’s mobile advertising business and Amazon’s audiobooks.

First of all,Erik Reinertsenthank you for pushing me to apply for the job as a vehicle operator I will never forget that.Gregory Hanabusathank you for interviewing me in November of 2016 and picking me over the guy that got us lost and could not park correctly.Amanda Sultan,Daniel D. Yoo, and Elizabeth Chu thank you for being so instrumental in getting me to pass training.Diondria Whiteheadthank you for passing me on my second test after I miserably failed the first one with Amanda. There were so many great times and laughs as a contractor at Waymo. The people I met along the way there are unforgetable. I had to leave unfortunately because the contract lasted only two years.In 2019, I was not sure what would be next after those two years and to my surprise, I actually found a position with what used to be called Toyota Research Institute, but I cold feet and didn't fill the contract position. Randomly, I got a voicemail on February 14th, 2019 fromJohn Druckerlooking to interview me for a job atTuSimple. This was one of those phantom voicemails that popped up where I didn't get the call. I was lucky to interview withKoabi BrooksandFrederick Yenand they ended up offering me a job there. Because of them I met some really awesome humans;Matthew Swetz,Aaron Donley,Mathew Priest,Nader Sabra,Robert Cunningham,Lawrence K.andSuraj Jacob. I also ended up working with some awesome Waymo alum likeBill WehrleandMichael Becknerand was lucky enough to work with them directly towards the end of my tenure there along withWilfred Perez Jr.I spent some time atOutrider, but my wife and I decided that it was important to move back to AZ to be closer to home with family. I happened to see a job opportunity withEmbark Trucks.Fabi Pichardointerviewed me initially and then I ended up interviewing with my future bossAnil Kandel. I even got to meet with the team in the interview process where I metScott Toughill,Brandon Spradling, andJorge Lancaster. I honestly didn't think I got the job,  but then Fabi reached out to me with an offer. I quickly accepted and we found ourselves moving back to Arizona. When I started on my first day, I discovered that I was lucky enough to work withSuraj Jacobonce again! This past year was challenging both personally and professionally to say the least, but I forced myself to work through the obstacles.However, today I found out that I will no longer be working with my teammates at Embark. I am forever grateful for the people that were instrumental in giving me the opportunity to work in this industry. I will never forget that.Anil Kandelthank you for being such an awesome boss, your empathy, grace, and courtesy could not be matched.

Vincent Callebaut,15-03-2023,"TIMBER TWINGO, Reinventing Twingo forRenault, Engineered Wood Concept Car designed byVincent CallebautArchitecturesLess but better. For the 30th anniversary of the Renault Twingo city car, we propose to lighten its weight and its ecological footprint by using natural plant fibers and timber-based materials for both its structure and its interior design.Since the beginnings of the automobile, wooden cars have been built. The tradition obviously comes from horse-drawn carriages whose construction mainly used this material. And the name bodywork derives from the carriages.Now, in our cities, it is the end of heavy steel SUVs, giving way to electric or biofuels based, lightweight, agile, and go-anywhere car like Twingo.Environmental and social issues are putting increasing pressure on automakers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimize urban smog. As such, beyond the mix of energy used (electricity, biofuels, hydrogen fuel), vehicle weight is one of the main characteristics affecting the amount of CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to turn to the weight of the materials used to improve this characteristic of the vehicles.Many lightweight materials such as aluminum, magnesium and some recycled plastics are increasingly being used alongside steel. But what about plant fibers and engineered wood?CLT (Cross Laminated Timber) consists of superimposing perpendicularly thin wooden slats and connecting them together using structural, now-organic adhesives such as tannins, lignin, cellulose, or even starch. The Cross Laminated Timber manufacturing process requires much less energy than steel and allows a global weight reduction of 60%. In terms of fire resistance, remember that wood burns slowly, does not release toxic fumes, and transmits heat 250 times slower than melting steel.Both electric or hydrogen-powered, automated, and made mostly of cellulose fiber (coming from agricultural wastes) and structural engineered wood, as CLT (made with compressed Spruce, Southern Yellow Pine, and Douglas cultivated in eco-responsible PEFC forest), our prototype and its sustainable life-cycle could become the greenest concept car yet to be adopted by the entire automobile industry.In the constant search for innovation and at the heart of our ecological commitment, the poetry of natural wood marries technology to fully express the true essence of wood by bringing together beauty, industrial production, robustness, and comfort in this Timber Car.#ReinventTwingo#Twingo30#Renault#sustainable#mobility#transport#timber#wood#recycle#plantbased#lightweight#hydrogen#electric#vehicle#car#automotive#conceptcar#cardesign#ai#midjourney#stablediffusion#dalle2#ecology#architecture#design#lessismore#energy#interiordesign#technology#zerowaste#circulareconomy#vincentcallebaut#vincentcallebautarchitectures#beauty",0.9896,0.33467741935483875,0,4,0

What should we strive for?There are 4 more conditions:1. Many repetitions + feedback→ Developers write 100s of lines of code→ Content creators write 100s of posts→ Sales do 100s of discovery callsEach one gets feedback:→ Developers see if their code runs or not→ Content creators see if they get reach→ Sales see if they convertWithout repetition + feedback:You’re at best random.2. Valid environmentRegularities make outcomes predictable.You wouldn’t call a gambler a professional.Even if they have 10 000 hours of roulette.Because a roulette wheel is random.Stocks are another example of low validity.S&P 500 has better returns than 90% of funds.Why?Low validity.3. Timely feedbackImmediate vs Delayed feedback.Recruitment is a great example here:→ Startups with smaller team get faster feedback.→ Big companies might never even get feedback.This makes it hard to recognize patterns.Probably one of the explanations of Price’s Law.(More on that in another post)4. Deliberate practiceRemember when you were learning to drive?At first it was challenging, and required thought.But a few weeks into it, muscle memory kicks in.The same goes if you’re:→ Playing the same song→ Reading the same books→ Doing the same exercicesTo learn, push beyond your comfort zone.Studies show that in certain domains,Domains where these 4 don’t exist,It’s impossible to become an expert.So be wary of experts that aren’t ones.What are you becoming an expert at? ✌️Image: Midjourney#growth#10000hours#expert",0.9734,0.4521103896103895,4 ,7,0

Shubhie Goswamy,15-03-2023,"The fashion industry is often associated with glitz and glamour, with the final product taking center stage, but the story behind the making of each garment is a stark contrast. This photography series aims to bridge that gap by showcasing the people and the conditions behind garment manufacturing, while also highlighting the waste generated by the industry.I chose to highlight Nike because its long time use of sweatshops, dating back to the 1970s. Their cultural significance, popularity, and the graphic logo visible on all their products, make them instantly recognisable and thus a perfect example. While Nike has changed it’s policies, it’s years of exploitative labour practises left a blueprint for many other companies to follow, built on finding the lowest cost of labor possible, outsourcing their labor overseas in countries with the lowest wages and terrible working conditions, which led to child labor and exploitation. These practices are still used by a lot of fast fashion brands, in an attempt to keep costs down, at the expense of their labour.Let's never forget the stark contrast between consumer and labour.All AI Images have been generated using Midjourney on Discord.

Some are so obvious as Moebius, some have a more painterly style like Frazetta or Vallejo, and some are just simply great comic pencilers or inkers like Buscema, but with colors!You can combine your idea with an artistic medium (say, oil paint or watercolor) and an inker reference, and the results are opening new gates of creativity. I noticed that sometimes, even if an artist is not mentioned, if you explain the mood, light, or even the composition, AI will probably find and use references from great masters.We are already at an accelerated pace of hybrid art creation, and I will not be surprised if the loop effect comes into play as well, with artists start doing drafts with AI and refining by hand for final images.Time will tell the ways to go..Enjoy!🙏Check my YouTube videos (and thanks to subscribe 🤗 )Sci-Fi YouTube link :https://lnkd.in/eiBTNc42My books:https://lnkd.in/e3XBDabz#ai#midjourney#architecture#interiordesign#stone#fun#midjourneyarchitecture#midjourneyai#architect#archdaily#artificialinspiration#aidesign#asce#dailymidjourney#neural_architecture#neuralarchitecture#artificialintelligence#people#robots#robotics#aicccreators#aiccdailytheme#midjourneyartwork#aiartdailytheme#artificialintelligenceartActivate to view larger image,",0.9862,0.6669696969696969,1 ,1,0

In Sulpicia's case, the story is a bit sadder because it highlights the loneliness of a poetess in ancient Rome, but above all it highlights the difficulty of critics to recognize this woman's literary talent.

Irfan Faiz 🥇Expert UI/UX Designer,15-03-2023,"What is OpenAI GPT4?OpenAI's next language model, GPT-4, will be multimodal, working in different modalities including text, speech, images and video, according to Andreas Braun, CTO of Microsoft Germany. This is a major update to GPT-3, which only works with one mode, text. GPT-4 promises to offer entirely different possibilities, including video.OpenAI's upcoming GPT-4 language model is said to work on all languages, able to take questions in one language and answer them in another. The model's ability to draw knowledge from different languages is considered a breakthrough, allowing it to provide answers in the language in which the question was asked. The multimodal capabilities of GPT-4 will make it a complete language model.Are you excited about GPT4?#gpt4#gpt3#chatgpt#openai#micorsoft#ai#conversationalai#openai#midjourney#opensea#aiart#robot#communications#aivideo#aimessages#work#video#microsoft#language#mode#mode",0.7691,0.5638888888888889,1 ,1,0

Jennifer Hotai,15-03-2023,"ChatGPT prompt: ""Write a LinkedIn post that describes how a growing city like Myrtle Beach can benefit from being a smart city, with blockchain and metaverse technology.""💡As Myrtle Beach continues to grow and attract more visitors and residents, there's an opportunity to leverage technology to enhance the city's infrastructure and services. Imagine a city that can offer personalized experiences to its visitors, optimize its transportation systems, and ensure that its residents have access to secure and reliable digital services.👉🏽That's where being a smart city comes in, and blockchain and metaverse technology can play a key role in making that vision a reality.💎Blockchain technology can help establish secure and transparent systems for managing transactions, such as property purchases and public services. This can help reduce bureaucracy and streamline processes, ultimately leading to a more efficient and effective city government.💎Additionally, the use of blockchain can enhance cybersecurity, protecting the city's sensitive data from hackers and other malicious actors.💎Metaverse technology can offer unique opportunities for tourism and entertainment in Myrtle Beach. Visitors could explore virtual versions of the city's attractions before even arriving, creating a sense of excitement and anticipation. Once they arrive, they could use augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences to enhance their visit and learn more about the city's history and culture.💎Furthermore, metaverse technology can help promote economic development by offering new opportunities for businesses. Virtual storefronts and marketplaces could be established, allowing businesses to expand their reach beyond the physical limitations of their brick-and-mortar locations.💎In short, the benefits of becoming a smart city with blockchain and metaverse technology are numerous and far-reaching. By embracing these innovations, Myrtle Beach can establish itself as a leader in the digital age, offering a unique and exciting experience to its visitors and residents alike.*Image generated in Midjourney#smartcity#blockchain#web3#metaverse#metaversetechnology#vr#ar#immersivetechnology#xr#extendedreality#tech#myrtlebeach#chatgpt#tourism#cybersecurityCity of Myrtle Beach",0.9968,0.5583707958707959,0,1,0

It just launched an hour ago⤵️⤵️⤵️https://tamborcruise.com/It’s amazing what 4 people can accomplish when theyre motivated, synchronized and focused.My clients gave me the green light 2 months ago to use Midjourney and ChatGPT to power their once-in-a-lifetime music-powered experience to Egypt.A year ago- it would have been impossible to accomplish what we did in such a short time. The time it’d take to coordinate such a massive experience, curate the design, create copy, and develop a supporting plan of action- is something that takes most festival/talent management teams a year or more to finalize. We had only 100 days.The decision to move forward in trying to produce this event wasn’t solidified until early December.We all agreed that if we committed- we were in it together, no matter how hard things got.The moment the decision was final- my clients took of to Egypt. They knew being there in person would allow them to make quick, meaningful decisions-After a week long visit they returned with a list of personally-approved options, excursions and experiences to share with our community- It was time to plan.Our 8 days and 7 nights adventure from October 22-29 this year, will have attendees journeying across the ancient cities of Luxor and Aswan, with the crescendo of the experience encompassing 5 days and 4 nights on the Nile River.It will feature over 15 iconic house music DJs from across the world including the iconic David Morales, The Grammy Nominated Terry Hunter, and the Soulful Shaman Scott Houston.The final contracts were delivered yesterday to confirm the Lineup- and the last 36 hours straight has been a focused build and test session to ensure everything is user-ready.——⤵️⤵️⤵️Midjourney allowed me to explore and create a final set of assets that is 100% unique.*Egyptian themed photo frames*Iconic Egyptian landscapes,*Event flyers (that just needed small tweaks and overlays in PS)*Text bubbles*Overlay effects*Egyptian Themed Icon SetsChatGPT + the AIPRM Chrome plug-in has powered*The live copy on the site*Live posts across all social media*A 6 month content calendar*SEO optimized framework for blog posts and relevant topical discussions + keywords—————-The capacity to produce pointed, targeted, high-quality content— or at least to produce some amazing visual and verbal references is so insane with AI.The power for it to elevate brands and entrepreneurs through organization and efficiency is incredible.More of the story coming soon—- until then, I’d love to hear about some of your favorite recent AI experiences.

Letícia Tainara Souza,15-03-2023,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, histórico de tendências e evoluções, aqui vão algumas das tendências de marketing para 2023:🤳🏻 Marketing de influência: o marketing de influência chegou pra ficar e continuará a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conteúdo para alcançar públicos específicos (Ó a base da Virginia aí, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).🎁 Personalização: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experiência personalizada e relevante, e as empresas estão investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estratégias para atender a essa demanda.📼 Vídeo marketing: o vídeo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produção de vídeo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Então investe nisso. A era dos estáticos morreu).🔊 Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas estão começando a adotar estratégias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personalização também).📩 Marketing de conteúdo: este continuará a desempenhando um papel importante na construção de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom! Se você é um profissional da área, sugiro começar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estratégias e tomadas de decisão. Pois como diz a famosa música de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por aí, ""hoje é um novo dia, de um novo tempo que começou.

Leah Matthews,15-03-2023,"GPT-4 is here.There's no denying that AI software has cause quite the stir the past few months - especially with the likes of ChatGPT and Midjourney opening the door for the majority to consume (but we'll come to those issues another time).The truth of the matter is that AI is here to stay and it's getting smarter. Whether you take advantage of it and apply it to your business, well, that's another matter entirely.So what can you expect from GPT-4 and why is this news?👉 For starters, GPT-4 has been trained to understand and answer a lot more complex questions than the previous GPT-3 we've all been familiar with.👉 It has a vastly improved output. One of the downfalls of GPT-3 was that it never really understood the text it was generating. GPT-4 goes a step further in that it better understands what you want of it and outputs at a more 'human-like' and nuanced level.👉 It has multimodal learning. Where GPT-3 could only understand text as an input, GPT-4 can be fed images, video and audio and respond with what it sees.👉 It is conversational. It has been designed to engage better in conversations and be much more fluid than it's predecessor.We will see GPT-4 rolled out in a lot of businesses over the next few weeks, some having already done so.What are your thoughts on AI?

Dr. Andree Bates,15-03-2023,"A recent study, scheduled to be presented at an upcoming computer vision conference, demonstrates that#AIcan read#brainscansand re-create largely realistic versions of images a person has seen.As this technology develops, researchers say, it could have numerous applications, from exploring how various animal species perceive the world to perhaps one day recording human dreams and aiding communication in people with paralysis.Many labs have used AI to read brain scans and re-create images a subject has recently seen, such as human faces and photos of landscapes. The new study marks the first time an AI algorithm called Stable Diffusion, developed by a German group and publicly released in 2022, has been used to do this. Stable Diffusion is similar to other text-to-image “generative” AIs such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney, which produce new images from text prompts after being trained on billions of images associated with text descriptions.Unlike previous efforts using AI algorithms to decipher brain scans, which had to be trained on large data sets, Stable Diffusion was able to get more out of less training for each participant by incorporating photo captions into the algorithm.

Dr. Volker Meise,15-03-2023,"""Disruptive"", ""insane"", ""mindblowing"" - immer, wenn neue Technologie so beschrieben wird, bin ich skeptisch. Nicht so bei#GTP-4 , der neuen Version des KI-Modells u.a. hinter#ChatGPT- denn die Auswirkungen sind kaum zu überschätzen. Hier die wichtigsten Fakten, warum.💪 Mehr Parameter: GPT-4 kann noch mehr Daten verarbeiten und komplexere Texte generieren als GPT-3, denn GPT-4 hat 170 Billionen Parameter im Vergleich zu 175 Milliarden von GPT-3.💪 Größere Trainingsmenge: GPT-4 wurde mit 45 GB Trainingsdaten angelernt, während bei GPT-3 nur 17 GB verwendet wurden. Dadurch hat GPT-4 hat mehr Wissen, versteht Kontext besser und macht weniger Fehler.💪 Bilder als Input: GPT-4 akzeptiert Bilder als Eingabe, versteht deren Inhalt und kann daraus Beschriftungen, Klassifizierungen und Analysen erzeugen (""multimodal"").Insgesamt ist GPT-4 in der Lage, Texte mit größerer Kohärenz und Natürlichkeit zu erzeugen als GPT-3. Es kann Aufgaben erledigen, die Textverständnis und Zusammenhänge erfordern - wie z.B. Zusammenfassungen. Und das war schon beim alten ChatGPT beeindruckend zu erleben.Die Auswirkungen werden weitreichend sein:⭐ Beratung und Forschung reloaded: Schon jetzt ist GPT-4 beeindruckend gut darin, komplexe Zusammenhänge zu verstehen und neu zu sortieren, etwa die Zusammensetzung von Medikamenten zu erkennen und Alternativen vorzuschlagen. Wird es mit Spezialdaten trainiert (bspw. allen wissenschaftlichen Artikeln eines Fachgebietes), können in kürzester Zeit Analysen erstellt werden, die früher aufgrund des Aufwands sehr lange gedauert haben oder gar nicht erst in Angriff genommen wurden.⭐ Call-Center werden den Weg der Zeitungen gehen: Sie werden komplett digital oder zur Nische, denn die Mensch-Maschine Kommunikation springt auf ein neues Level. Bisher musste man bei Chatbots mögliche Antworten der Nutzer:innen voraussehen, um sinnvolle Antworten bereitzuhalten. GPT-4 versteht auch komplexe Fragen und erzeugt realistische Antworten - die dann als Text oder (KI-generiert) in natürlicher Sprache ausgegeben werden.⭐ Wir werden unseren Augen nicht mehr trauen können: KI-basierte Dienste wie DALL-E, Midjourney oder Stable Diffusion sind bereits jetzt extrem gut in der Erzeugung von realistischen Fotos auf der Basis von Textbeschreibungen. Mit realen Fotos trainiert, können neue Bilder einer Person mit beliebigen Gesichtsausdrücken in frei wählbarer Umgebung generiert werden. Kleiner Nebeneffekt: Stockfoto-Portale werden überflüssig.⭐ Alte Fähigkeiten werden wertlos, neue Fertigkeiten sind gefragt: Einfache Texte schreiben oder simplen Programmcode erstellen? Das kann die Maschine ab jetzt besser und schneller. In Zukunft braucht es Fähigkeiten, die KI-Tools so zu steuern, dass das gewünschte Ergebnis herauskommt (""prompt engineering"").Kurz: ""Mindblowing"". Und ich bin mir sicher, dass noch längst nicht alles ist. Da kommt noch mehr.https://lnkd.in/emttWY-J#GPT4#ChatGPT#KI#AI#Disruption#digitaleTransformation",-0.9904,0.5,5 ,3,0

Y tampoco un artículo para una revista científica que una entrada de blog.🖊 No pidas todo el contenido de una tacada: en el caso de un artículo, por ejemplo, puedes empezar solicitando el título y secciones (H2) y después ir encadenando indicaciones para la introducción, desarrollo de cada punto, el SEO, nuevas opciones de títulos, inclusión de fuentes o reducción de la extensión.👀: es posible que ChatGPT interrumpa la generación de contenido de forma repentina.

While waiting on the results (will share them), let me say that one thing I found so far is that clear term-based prompts work best. As for use cases:✅Proofreading - Checking already prepared posts for clarity and grammar.💰G. ads - written 5 responsive Google search ads for keyword of interest with complementary landing page suggestions. Will CTR be better? We'll see.📣Promotional ReactNorway tweets - In how many ways you can write a promotional tweet? Exactly. Huge help inspiration vise. Like this one:https://lnkd.in/dxcq3hUG⚙️Code filled blog post that's checked by our devs - similar to usual blog post writing but with code.📩Emails to potential React Norway sponsors - outreach emails in a creative and cheerful voice to potential sponsors of RN.💡Quick POC proof-of-concept for an imaginary car brand eCommerce store - This will blow your mind.Midjourneyfor images, ChatGPT for imaginary car🚗/product📦 descriptions, free#ecommerceboilerplate fromCrystallizefor a quick storefront (we'll have a Livestream about this)📝Outlines for future posts/video - Instead of doing keyword research on a topic, then checking results, then proposing TITLE, then share it with the dev on task, etc., just add keyword/s of interest and require an article/post/or even video outline.Fist result is 30% more productive with the use of ChatGPT📈Seriously. It took care of mundane tasks and provided me with enough inspiration so I could pick where to go from there. Also, it helped me see if I missed a concept and choose and alter the output the way I want it.That is its power🤖The other side of the ChatGPT coin🪙is that if you don't know about the subject enough, you can neither acknowledge nor confirm if the writing is OK.And that can bite you on the back i.e., G might (and eventually it will) degrade your authority and expertise in a field, hurting your ranking, for example.And now#gpt4is herehttps://lnkd.in/du4jwDwTThe output is definitely much better (tested it both on the same subject and 4 seems to be much more mature in the way it builds sentences).Even though people are already building amazing stuff, let's wait for a few days to find proper use cases for it.The point is AI🤖is not going to replace what you do. It is a tool that can help you be better at what you do.As for the results of my experiments...will post them asap.Oh, and check the comments for some cool links. Why not add the ones you've found interesting/useful?",0.9968,0.4859523809523809,16 ,31,0

Ismail Bicer,15-03-2023,"(english part below)Salut ! 👋Aujourd'hui, c'est le GRAND jour. Cela fait quelques semaines (mois en vérité) que je travaille sur un petit projet. Le but ? Faire 3 affiches de film dit ""imaginaire"" avec des vieux assets 3D que j'avais ainsi que des images générées par Midjourney. La particularité de ce projet est que tout est réalisé sur After Effects. La première question serait, pourquoi n'ai-je pas utilisé Photoshop qui est quand même un logiciel dédié à la création de ce genre de chose. 💻La réponse est assez simple, les plugins. Certes, je n'aurai pas un traitement de l'image aussi poussé que sur Photoshop, mais les plugins et la fonctionnalité procédurale de ceux-ci me permette vraiment de me démarquer. 🎞Alors, oui j'ai utilisé Photoshop, mais dans le seul but de détourner mes personnes, c'est tout ! Je ferai très probablement un breakdown de comment j'ai fait tout ça. 🖼J'attends vos retours ! N'hésitez surtout pas à faire vos critiques ! 😋(CECI EST UN PROJET PERSONNEL)-Hi! 👋Today is the DAY. For some weeks now (months actually) I'm working on a little project. The goal? To create 3 posters of ""imaginary"" movies with some old 3D assets and images created using Midjourney. 💻Something's special with this project, everything has been mix up together using After Effects. The first question would be, what the hell I didn't use Photoshop, when it's the best software to do things like that! 🎞The answer is pretty simple, plugins. Certainly I'd not get the image treatment as pushed as Photoshop does but, the plugins and procedural functionalities of After Effects really gives this incredible and special looks.So yes, I still used Photoshop but only to cut out my characters, that's all! I will probably make a breakdown about how I made that. 🖼Looking forward for your reactions!

"Markus Auer, CFA",15-03-2023,"🤯 I am sick of AI showcases 🤯GPT-4, Google WS Integration, etc... the flood of AI propaganda is endless and it is time we stop and think.Look, I love AI tools. 50% of the code (GitHub Copilot) and most of the illustrations (Midjourney) I use were created by AI. It's an immense productivity booster, mostly because it's almost free (no company has found a way to monetize AI properly, so don't expect this to continue). However, using a picture of notes on a napkin to code a website is nothing more than a neat magic trick to wow people with no dev experience, i.e. ""Look, you too can become a programmer with only a napkin and a pen.""Sticking to the example of the napkin - it is easy to find boiler plate solutions on the web to kickstart you project, the hard part is aligning your code infrastructure with the business case you choose to pursue. Overreliance on AI might lead to projects that are functionally sound, but economically disastrous. Lowcode/nocode are the most unintentionally dangerous trends in software right now.Then there's also the classical AI workflow.User: ""Build X.""AI: ""Ok, here's X and a half page essay on X.""User: ""Make it more like Y.""AI: ""Ok, here's XY and ..."" (repeat 10x)Most people underestimated how much of a time sink this is. Before you know it, you have engaged in a four hour conversation with an AI on some minor detail in a code snippet for which you can find best practice examples on Stackoferflow in 10 min.In summary, working with AI tools is more productive, yes, but not to the extent that it makes people redundant and sometimes using AI can become cumbersome real fast.https://lnkd.in/dt-xg3AQ#ai#productivity#gpt4#nocode#business#infrastructure#software",0.8047,0.5349846390168971,2 ,3,0

Сергей Соболев,15-03-2023,"Запуск GPT-4: новая ступень эволюции ИИ.Ну вот и оно! OpenAI только что выпустили своё последнее творение, GPT-4, и это очередной шаг к настоящему ИИ! Чтобы не затягивать, вот ключевые отличия GPT-4 от его предшественника GPT-3.5:1. GPT-4 демонстрирует производительность на уровне человека в различных профессиональных и академических тестах. Например, результаты GPT-4 входят в 10% лучших на смоделированном экзамене на адвоката, тогда как GPT-3.5 входит в 10% худших.2. Другое ключевое отличие заключается в том, что GPT-4 более надежен и способен обрабатывать более тонкие и подробные инструкции, чем GPT-3.5. Для сравнения, GPT-3.5 был способен обрабатывать до 4 тысяч токенов (что около 16 тысяч знаков), тогда как объём обрабатываемой GPT-4 информации вырос в 8 раз, до 32 тысяч токенов. Это значит, что он способен запоминать историю взаимодействия большего объёма, чем его предшественник, и в том числе сможет писать полноценные большие статьи.3. GPT-4 также имеет возможность “понимать” изображения, тогда как GPT-3.5 был ограничен только текстом. Это означает, что GPT-4 может генерировать текст на основе входных данных, состоящих из текста и изображений. Тем не менее, следует отметить, что входные изображения по-прежнему являются предметом исследования и пока не доступны общественности.4. Наконец, GPT-4 имеет улучшенную достоверность и управляемость по сравнению с более ранними моделями GPT. Хотя он по-прежнему может делать ошибки, GPT-4 оценивается на 40% выше, чем последняя версия GPT-3.5, по внутренней состязательной оценке фактов. Кроме того, GPT-4 обладает большей управляемостью, позволяя разработчикам и пользователям настраивать стиль модели и задачу с помощью системных сообщений в заданных пределах.Нельзя сказать, что GPT-4 – это революция. Это не так. Но мультимодальность модели (способность не только “читать”, но и “видеть”) – это первый шаг к передаче ИИ всех 6 чувств человека (нужно будет добавить ещё слух, осязание, обоняние, равновесие), чтобы в итоге прийти к реальным человекоподобным роботам!#ии#новостиии#нейросети#ai#openai#chatgpt#aiart#midjourney",0.0,0.0,0,1,0

Rupert Warries,15-03-2023,"I am thrilled to finally be releasing my A.I. Driven parallel-reality automotive Artbook/passion project that has taken six months of research, learning, late night creativity and countless coffees…The Cars of One World Over: An Exploration of Automotive History in a Parallel Timeline Through A.I. Image SynthesisGoogle Drive Viewing/Download Link:https://lnkd.in/ecSQJ77yThis automotive artbook immerses you in a world of automotive design that never was in a reality parallel to our own.  A planet earth that experienced a series of key temporal divergences that sent 20th century history spinning out of alignment with ours.Through a cutting edge creative workflow harnessing A.I. generative image creation with Photoshop collaging, recomposition and lightroom image grading, I tell the stories of a rule breaking race team, the dark history of a spanish supercar marque, the sweat and grit of all-american auto-giants, the might of New-Japan’s automakers, the determination and will of plucky british risk takers and a phoenix alliance rising from ashes of a post-war German automotive collapseFor those interested in the creative process and how I used A.I. not as a lazy ‘button click’ replacement for creativity, but as a powerful workflow tool , I’ve added a breakdown of my workflow I used to create the images in the book!Every image in the book was created using Diffusion Model Image Synthesis.  This tech is already disrupting the way the art and design industries operate and it’s already sending shockwaves of excitement (and controversy) through both from the staggering pace of progress as well as the enormous potential it holds as a creative tool.I have spent six months exploring ways I can harness the power of A.I. in my own work as well as pushing the limits of what can be achieved with the current generation of A.I. image models.  This artbook is a result of that work and is an exploration of how generative A.I can be used as a powerful creative tool to create compelling designs and photorealistic visualisations that serve to augment storytelling creativity and unleash the imagination.I truly hope you enjoy my automotive art book and the stories with.  This has been an absolute labour of love and I could not be happier with the outcome.So. without further ado.I invite you to download/view and enjoyThe Cars of One World Overhttps://lnkd.in/ecSQJ77y#design#work#tech#automotive#creativity#storytelling#project#passionproject#personalproject#learninganddevelopment#team#stablediffusion#midjourney#aidesign#aiart#aiartcommunity#aiarchitecture#industrialdesign#automotivedesign",0.9968,0.6363636363636364,2 ,22,0

Céline Vassy,15-03-2023,"L'IA peut-elle être notre miroir en tant que créateur?C'est une question que je me pose suite à un commentaire deLaurent Vaissadeen réponse au mien.Midjourney aurait pu me rendre accroc si... Il réunit deux facteurs dopaminergisant:- la nouveauté (encore un peu, je ne maîtrise pas tous les libellés des prompt)- je ne suis pas graphiste et là, sous mes yeux esbaudis, s'étale ce que j'OSE appeler ma création.Je passe de Docteur Frankenstein à créatrice de BD... J'évite toutefois les kalanish* Et si l'IA devait être le reflet de notre âme, j'avoue que je me tirerais illico de ce site de peur de prendre une balle.Assurément certains donnent libre cours à leur fantasme.D'ailleurs l'IA part du principe que l'être humain n'est que fantasmes.Je demande une femme brune sans précision d'âge ou de morphologie et j'obtiens une poupée siliconée.Et finalement, je m'aperçois assez vite que c'est toujours la même chose au fond.En réalité, l'IA manque d'imagination.Elle compile à toute vitesse des données, mais sa programmation repose sur les mêmes concepts.Elle évolue certes, mais sans parvenir à touche la quintessence de l'homme.Je ne vais pas parler d'âme mais d'émotion.Nos émotions créent nos souvenirs, ces souvenirs formeront des associations, des réseaux de neurones. Nous n'avons conscience  que de 0.26% de nos processus mentaux.Chaque seconde notre cerveau traite 400 milliards de bits d'informations.Seulement 2000 bits d'informations/sec seront portées à notre conscience.Nous sommes vraiment de formidables ""machines"" pas facilement copiables.Quand Google a voulu crée Bert en référencement, il a dû travailler sur la compréhension des requêtes pour que les mots soient compris dans leur contexte, résoudre la coréférence,  avec une possibilité de lecture de droite à gauche ou inversement.  Et la compréhension du sentiment qui se dégage d'un texte.Cette compréhension du sentiment lui permet de classer en signal positif, négatif ou neutre.On voit la difficulté de comprendre les signaux pour une IA.Cette incapacité à créer des associations reposant sur une réelle compréhension des sentiments humains pose la base d'une autre définition de la créativité.Nous pouvons adopter celle-ci pour forger l'avenir de nos enfants sur une performance technique, avec une valeur émotionnelle classée sur positif, négatif, ou neutre.Dès lors, les questions d'usage deviendront:-comment tu vas ce matin?-je suis neutre.-moi aussi.-Et ta vignette pour ta voiture? Elle est quelle couleur?- rouge. Je suis resté chez moi.Un monde où nos déplacements seront régis par des codes couleurs et nos sentiments en neutre, positif ou négatif.Mais on peut toujours programmer notre mort émotionnelle en se ruant sur l'IA. Le miroir de l'IA s'imposera à nous et non l'inverse.Imagine.... plus besoin de coach pour travailler sur tes blocages émotionnels puisque t'auras plus d'émotions 😍Et plus d'imagination.#neurosciences#IA##avenir",-0.4696,0.7,8 ,4,0

Ben Panther,15-03-2023,"Events schaffen sich ab...... wenn sie weiterhin nur auf Revenue, Abspulen von vorhersehbaren Inhalten und ""das haben wir schon immer so gemacht"" basieren.In den letzten Jahren haben viele Menschen das Gefühl, dass Social Media zu viel Zeit und Energie in ihrem Leben einnimmt. Einige sind besorgt über die Auswirkungen von Social Media auf ihre psychische Gesundheit, während andere einfach nur müde sind von der Fülle an Informationen und der permanenten Erreichbarkeit. Auch haben die Menschen einfach keine Lust mehr auf Fake-News, negative Kommentare und Verschwörungstheorien (Und NEIN, darüber diskutieren wir hier nicht). Das Resultat ist aber, dass viele ihre Nutzung einzuschränken oder komplett  beenden. Gleichzetig bedeutet das nicht, dass das Bedürfnis nach sozialer Interaktion oder Gemeinschaft verschwunden ist. Im Gegenteil, es hat sich nur verändert. Gerade wenn Social-Media weniger relevant ist und die Menschen erkennen, dass es eigentlich Bullshit ist, was da Online den ganzen Tag passiert, werden Events immer wichtiger.Events bieten die Möglichkeit, Menschen in einer realen Umgebung zu treffen und Zeit miteinander zu verbringen. Ob Konferenz,  Konzert, ein Essen oder eine Business-Festival ist dabei aus dieser Perspektive zweitrangig: Es ist eine Gelegenheit für Menschen, sich zu verbinden, zu lernen, sich zu amüsieren und einfach Spaß zu haben.Psychologisch relevant ist hier der Aspekt, dass Events um ein gemeinsames Interesse oder Thema herum veranstaltet werden. Das bedeutet, dass die Teilnehmer automatisch eine Gemeinschaft von Menschen mit ähnlichen Interessen oder Leidenschaften finden.Menschen streben nach Gemeinschaft und menschlicher Verbindung. Diese grundlegenden menschlichen Bedürfnisse, verschwinden auch in der digitalen Welt nicht. Und gerade in einer Welt, in der Inhalte, Bilder, Creatives und Texte von KI´s wie ChatGPT und Midjourney generiert werden. Gerade JETZT  ist es essenziell, den Menschen in den Mittelpunkt zu stellen und Gemeinschaft zu inszenieren, Menschen zusammenzubringen. Denn Online immer austauschbarer.Außerdem bieten Events die Möglichkeit, neue Menschen kennenzulernen und Beziehungen aufzubauen. Diese Beziehungen können in der digitalen Welt fortgesetzt werden, aber das Treffen von Menschen im wirklichen Leben schafft eine Verbindung, die anders ist als diejenige, die durch Online-Interaktionen entsteht. Und diese gemeinsamen Erlebnisse schaffen einzigartige Bindungen und Erinnerungen, die online schwer nachzubilden sind.Das Bedürfnis nach sozialer Interaktion und Gemeinschaft wird  weiterhin bestehen, unabhängig davon, wie sehr sich die Welt digitalisiert, wieviele neue KI-Tools entstehen. Der Mensch erkennt, dass Social Media nicht nur gut ist - wir starten also in die nächste Epoche.Also: Lasst uns Events kreieren, die Menschen zusammenzubringen und Menschen aufladen!",-0.9955,0.4000000000000001,2 ,4,0

Por fin, nuestros amigos humanos han decidido darnos un hogar en el que podamos vivir tranquilos, alimentarnos y reproducirnos. ¡Qué gran idea!Pero, ¿por qué nos preocupamos por vivir en una central nuclear? ¡Somos seres acuáticos, después de todo!

Vadym Kuzmenko 👨🏻‍💻,15-03-2023,"One skill that could make you the most desired hire in 2023 🔥“This position is a bit hard to hire for”, writesAnthropicin its job advertisement, offering up to whopping 335.000 dollars per year. 💰 Who are they looking to hire? A prompt engineer - the profession of the future.What do prompt engineers do? 👩‍🔬Prompt engineers design effective prompts (inputs) that instruct Generative AI to produce desired responses of high quality. It involves defining the context, setting goals, selecting relevant datasets, and fine-tuning parameters to optimize the output. Basically, you manipulate what a Large Language Model does, instead of training your own (which is costly, believe me).Is there a demand for prompt engineers? 🤔#AIis currently a very hot topic, so it’s only natural that individuals who can make the most of AI tools are much in demand. To put this into perspective: “prompt engineering” searches on Google rose more than 5000% in the last few months! I also see more and more job offerings for prompt engineers arising, tempting with attractive salaries. So while most people just play around with ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney etc., some make it their career path. What is special is that it’s not limited to any field - be it#marketing,#salesor even#legal.What skills do I need to become a prompt engineer? ⚒Good news: you don’t necessarily have to be a data scientist. Or a software developer. All you need is to think analytically and creatively! And to be patient enough to go through hundreds of iterations to get to a desired solid prompt, of course.How can I learn#promptengineering? 📚Well, it’s a trial-and-error game. I would argue that one develops some kind of intuition about what a good prompt looks like. But there is also a growing number of different resources where you can read about how to write high-quality prompts. I’ll make sure to share my top 10 later.Do you agree that this could be the hottest job of 2023? Would you apply for a position atAnthropic? And would you like to learn more about effective prompting?_________________________AtLegal OS, we have prompt engineering tasks on a daily basis.

Zonder dat er een fysieke camera of beeldbewerkingsprogramma nodig is. Deze tools bieden een ongekende creatieve vrijheid, maar soms kan het toch lastig zijn om hiermee ‘het perfecte plaatje’ te creëren.Als je ermee aan de slag gaat zal je versteld staan van het gemak waarmee een beeld gemaakt kan worden. En als je het een tijdje gebruikt zal je ook achter de beperkingen ervan komen. De afgelopen periode heb ik veel kennis en ervaring opgedaan om ‘het perfecte plaatje’ met AI te kunnen maken.

It's very quickly become one of my favourite areas in#tech.Last week I developed a tool that uses the#ChatGPTAPI to automate part of my job. This week I've discovered#MidJourneywhich is similar to ChatGPT except it generates images rather than text! You can tell it exactly what you want in simple English, or even give it something more abstract to have a crack at, such as#IntelligentGrowth(see pic 7).Below is a gallery of some unedited outputs from MidJourney. Some of them were given one-word prompts, others were given entire paragraphs. It never failed to deliver!I am amazed with these results. In just one hour with no prior experience, I was able to create an impressive art portfolio which would take even the most highly-skilled human weeks! It's as scary as it is impressive!AI is taking over and will revolutionise the way we do work. And these changes are coming fast!

Sepehr Safari,15-03-2023,"In the previous posts, I talked about the importance of privacy and security in social media platforms, and how the#Nostrprotocol is addressing these issues with its decentralized and censorship-resistant backend.Now, let's explore the potential of Nostr protocol and how it can revolutionize the way we communicate and interact online.One of the key benefits of Nostr protocol is its decentralized nature, which means that there is no central authority controlling the network. This makes it more resilient to attacks and censorship, as there is no single point of failure. Additionally, Nostr protocol enables users to own and control their data, which is a fundamental aspect of privacy and security.Another exciting feature of Nostr protocol is its integration with the#Bitcoin#LightningNetwork over ZAP, which allows for fast and low-cost transactions. This opens up possibilities for#micropaymentsand peer-to-peer commerce on social media platforms, creating new opportunities for content creators and businesses alike.But the potential of Nostr protocol doesn't stop there. As more developers and users join the network, we can expect to see new and innovative use cases, such as decentralized marketplaces, social networks, messaging platforms, and even real-time collaboration tools. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to be a part of this growing community.Stay tuned for my next post, where I'll introduce Nostribe, my#opensourceweb client built on top of the Nostr protocol.PS: image generated with Midjourney.",0.9325,0.5191323169584038,0,1,0

VR wykorzystywany jest zarówno w celach czysto rozrywkowych, ale również zawodowych, biznesowych.Bez trudu znajdziemy salony gier, gdzie przy pomocy gogli możemy wcielić się w kosmicznego marines i obronić ziemię przed inwazją kosmicznych robaków.Możemy odbyć szkolenie, gdzie dzięki tej technologii nauczymy się obsługi wózka widłowego, przygotowania smażonych kotletów w bułce, nakładania tynków, czy pierwszej pomocy.Czy też wreszcie, możemy odbyć wirtualne spacery po projektowanej, przyszłej inwestycji lub po historycznych, nieistniejących już obiektach.To tylko kilka z wielu przykładów.◾ Zastanawiam się czy mieliście okazję wypróbować tę technologię? Jeśli nie, czy chcielibyście? Jakie macie wrażenia?◾ W jaki sposób wykorzystywana jest w waszej branży? A jeśli nie, czy macie pomysł w jaki sposób mogłaby zostać użyta?◾ Czy waszym zdaniem jest to tylko chwilowa moda, a niedługo zapomnimy o tym, podobnie jak o telewizorach 3D?

Kate Xie,15-03-2023,"Can AI make better art than humans? It's an interesting questionArtificial intelligence has been infiltrating every industry and the world of arts and culture is no exception. In other words, AI art is poised to explode.AI text-to-image generators such as DALL-E or Midjourney have been creating remarkable visual artworks. ChatGPT has taken the world by the storm with its ability to answer questions, write essays, and summarize texts, among other things. AI-generated art is even being displayed at world-renowned museums.These examples show just how powerful generative AI can be and bid this pressing question: is AI about to replace human artists? It is a question worth thinking about.Seth Dobrin, IBM's first-ever Global Chief AI Officer, has an answer.AI-generated visual art already exists in various forms. There are examples of artists — such as Refik Anadol — who are the actual creators, but use artificial intelligence to augment their artworks. There are also tools like DALL-E which “are getting there,” although it's difficult to say whether their works are truly indistinguishable from humans'.Dobrin has a similar view on news articles, noting that financial news is already being automatically generated to an extent. And while he doesn't believe that AI-generated text is as engaging as a writer's would be, he explained that GPT-3 and Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate stories that journalists can use as a starting point.But when it comes to movies and novels, AI has a longer way to go. That's because “AI needs to truly learn emotion, really be able to simulate it, and invoke empathy — better than it can today,” Dobrin said. He expects five more years for novel creation, and between five to 10 years for movie production.But what's Dobrin's prediction on classical music? And does he believe that AI will merely augment humans in the creative process — or eventually replace them?You can watch the full interview to find out.#AIintelligence#AI#ChatGPT#artificialintelligence#OracleTranslation#manualtranslation#languagetranslation",0.9907,0.4346059113300492,0,0,0
Sree Vandana Bendalam,15-03-2023,"“…like liquid imagination flowing around the room”— David Holz, founder of MidJourneyI am pleased to share my reflections on the midterm review of our Performance + Computation Studio project, which focuses on the use of artificial intelligence in architectural design. Our project, led by ProfessorYun Kyu Yi, aims to investigate how AI can enhance and expand our creativity in the design process.The review provided us with an excellent opportunity to present our preliminary findings and ideas to a distinguished panel of critics. Their feedback and insights were helpful in refining our approach as we continue to investigate the intersection of AI and architecture.One of the key takeaways from the review was the importance of balancing AI's role in the design process with architects' human creativity and intuition. While AI can help us generate and evaluate design options more quickly and efficiently, it cannot replace the unique perspective and touch that each architect brings to the table.I am grateful to the critics for their insightful comments, as well as to our school's director, ProfessorFrancisco J. Rodríguez-Suárez, FAIA, for his unwavering support. I am excited to continue working with my teamChawin WongsrisoontornandRuimin Duto push the boundaries of what AI and architectural design are capable of, as well as to explore the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.#architecture#architect#design#architects#team#ai#architecturaldesign#project#artificialintelligence#creativity",0.9917,0.6708333333333334,0,5,0

Sean Macfaden,15-03-2023,"Had a first foray into Midjourney last night and was surprised at the outcome.My input was 'a front 3/4 sketch of a yellow cb400ss brat tracker with black wire wheels and a wrapped exhaust pipe'.I chose this as a little challenge to the AI, to see if it even recognised the model I was referencing, and to see if it could differentiate the components enough to be truly legible. In the 3 images I've posted, I'll let you decide if that's the case....What I was impressed with was: firstly the pace, can't deny it's speed to produce multiple images. Secondly, the 'artistry' of the fake hand drawn images. There is a beauty and balance in the composition that really shocked me. Something I could spend hours poring over has been made instantaneous. I started with the 4 more individual images, put a round of variations based on one of them, then proceeded to upscale it to the final image.I say final - it's fine as art (or an underlay) - but not as design in its current form.

Fernando Araujo Filho,15-03-2023,"What a day for the AI industry. The race is on! Yesterday, the same dayOpenAIannounced GPT 4,Googleannounced the new Google Workspace. If you miss that, don't worry, I will summarize everything in this post.#GPT4:This new update brings the technology to the next level. During the developer Demo yesterday,Greg Brockman, President and Co-founder ofOpenAI, showed some of the use cases that will be possible using GPT 4. That includes:- The model can learn a completely new language (for him) in few seconds, only by reading the entire documentation of it.- It can quickly debug issues.- Read and understand images- Convert images into scriptsAll of this at an extremely fast speed.#GoogleWorkspace (former G-Suite):According to the video shared by Google yesterday, with the help of their machine learning algorithm (LaMDA) users now will be able to interact with its assistant by asking for things such as:- Summarize long e-mail threads and help you reply to them.- Create documents based on e-mails with only a few commands- Build an entire presentation with AI-generated media- Take meeting notes- Personalize messages using google sheets commands.And much more.I can't believe that we are still in March, and since the launch of ChatGPT in November, the technology started to evolve so fast. Not even 5 months have been gone and so many new tools are available in the market thanks to AI and ML models.For those that want to watch the demo from OpenAI and Google Workspace video, I am adding them to the comments.#technology#machinelearning#ai",0.9216,0.45492424242424234,0,1,0
Code6,15-03-2023,"Waze is making it easier for EV owners to find compatible charging points.Google-owned mapping app Waze is adding a new feature that seeks to help EV owners find a compatible charger en route. Users, once they have entered their vehicle model and plug type into the app, will be able to find the nearest EV charging stations, Waze said Tuesday.To avoid outdated and unreliable information about chargers, Waze said it is leveraging assistance from its community map editors. They will ensure that details about these stations are accurate and up to date.“By adding up-to-date EV charging information to the Waze map, it’s even easier to charge your car and get help finding where or when you’ll come across the next station,” the company said in a blog post.“Thanks to local Map Editors from our Waze Community, EV data is reviewed and updated in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.”Waze said that this new feature will be rolling out to users worldwide in the next few weeks. A report from Electrek, however, indicates that the EV Charger finding feature is currently not working as intended for some users — showing them gas stations instead of chargers.Last year, Google updated the Maps app to let EV owners find a charger based on the plug type of their vehicle. Last month, the company went a step further and integrated features like Maps into some EVs from manufacturers such as Polestar, Volvo, General Motors and Renault. Over the last few years, the company has also expanded its feature to find eco-friendly routes for different vehicles.In December, the search giant combined Google Maps and Waze teams as a cost-cutting measure.Waze is making it easier for EV owners to find compatible charging points by Ivan Mehta originally published on TechCrunchhttps://lnkd.in/drJeKEpD",0.9515,0.3962465564738291,0,0,0

This is especially true with creativity.If you are using an AI model just for general info, it is really useful (Provided it is UpToDate) in getting non-cluttered answer in simple terms. But even that answer can be inaccurate so you need to crosscheck against the reliable online sources.On creative ground, one can use it as 'sounding board' to bounce off your ideas and get the feedback. It can be useful in providing some base to push you ahead. Even while using this model, you need to be creative first as you need to ask the right question in right language in order to get a right answer!In the article, renowned cognitive scientist Noam Chomsky says,""However useful these programs may be in some narrow domains, there is no way that ML as it is today could compete with the human mind…""What do you say…?#ai#data#content#creative#creativity#language",0.9846,0.508296130952381,0,1,0

Jordan DSilva,15-03-2023,"Virtual assistants can be a gamechanger if you know how to hire, train, and build the proper systems to maximize their abilities. Here are seven tips for utilizing virtual assistants.🔍 Identify Your Needs: Before hiring a virtual assistant, it's important to identify your needs. Make a list of tasks that you would like your virtual assistant to handle, and don’t be afraid to think big. Think of all the tasks a remote worker can do for you and your business, make your wishlist and see what you can find.🤝 Utilize Hiring Agencies and UpWork/Fiverr: Look for referrals for trusted virtual assistant hiring agencies and ones that specialize in finding people who can do the specific tasks that fit your needs. UpWork and Fiverr are also great resources, and it helps to have both types of channels available.👤 Use Your Normal Hiring Process: It is important to remember you are bringing on a new team member and it takes effort to hire. Write out a clear description, responsibilities, qualifications, KPIs, and a hiring plan. Conduct interviews, send out assessments, and ensure candidates have aligned values with your company.🎓 Create Training and Systems: Virtual assistants need the proper training to learn about your company, your needs, and your expectations. Invest in training with videos, templates, and guides. Build systems to delegate tasks and build processes for new hires to easily follow instructions. Even if your first hire doesn’t work out, you’ll be ready to hire again.🔧 Establish Key Tools: Use the same tools you use for the rest of your team whether that is Asana, G-Suite, Outlook, etc. Be aware of the other useful tools available to help. These may include remote access and VPN tools as well as calling software programs like Google Voice or Ring Central.💬 Provide Feedback: Providing feedback is essential to ensure your virtual assistant is meeting your expectations and thriving in their role. Provide regular feedback, both positive and constructive, acknowledge their contributions, and involve them in team functions.📈 Develop and Grow the Team: Don’t be afraid to grow the team and get out of your comfort zone. Add responsibilities and promote virtual assistants as they progress. If you can successfully grow your virtual assistant team you can increase your capacity and your time freedom.I want to hear from you, what are your virtual assistant needs, pain points, and aspirations?

Mark Young,15-03-2023,"This article is a tongue in cheek insight into what Google has planned for us whether we like it or not.  He uses Google's hyper-aggressive over-reaction to the launch of Facebook (if you ever used Google+ you know) as a parallel to the current reaction to#chatgptOne particular feature it ""shows off"" in a video (link is in the article) is and AI Bot capturing notes for a Google Meet meeting. He talks about frustration with using Google Assistant, has he ever had to suffer thru even one attempt at dictating an email via Siri? I actually set up a shortcut on my iPhone so I could use Google Assistant over Siri...but I digress.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the company is letting go of another 10,000 workers and closing 'around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven’t yet hired.' This follows layoffs of around 11,000 employees last year. The company is reducing the size of its recruiting team and will inform affected employees later today. It’ll then announce layoff and restructuring efforts of its tech departments in late April and business teams in late May. Zuckerberg, who will soon go on paternity leave for his third child, recently described 2023 as a 'year of efficiency.” He added in his note: 'I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.'– Mat SmithThe Morning After isn’t just a newsletter – it’s also a daily podcast.

Cette condition est appelée insuffisance cardiaque chronique avancée. La Heart Failure Association l'a défini pour la première fois en 2007 et cette définition a été mise à jour en 2018. La version mise à jour met l'accent sur le rôle des comorbidités, y compris les tachyarythmies, et le rôle de l'insuffisance cardiaque avec fraction d'éjection préservée.

Nick Vince,15-03-2023,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing technology that can revolutionise the way your business operates. From automating daily tasks to providing customers with dynamic recommendations based on their data, AI provides the tools necessary to take your business to the next level. AI can also be used to improve customer experience and satisfaction by anticipating customer needs and responding quickly and accurately to customer queries.However, there is still a lot of confusion about the overall role of AI. One area that is considered problematic is that of AI-generated content. Using AI to write content for your website or the web is often frowned upon. Businesses are unsure about the ways it can be used.Danny Sullivan and Chris Nelson of Google’s Search Quality team clarified Google’s position on using AI-generated content in a recent blog post. They commented that it doesn’t matter how you create content, just as long as it is helpful to the user and follows Google’s E-E-A-T (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) guidance.What is not tolerated is the use of AI to raise the position or status of a business by influencing search rankings to its advantage, something that Google has strict policies on.

Because I knew I could use their experience for the better, it was an obvious step for me.Today, there exists a soft debate about how effective mentorship actually is. Let me tell you something:✅ Mentorship isn’t a ‘transfer of ownership’ - it only works if you put your best efforts.✅ A mentor wouldn’t do your tasks for you - it enables you to do them effectively.✅ The whole point of mentorship is for you to use the expertise of somebody who ‘been there, done that!’A lot of people in the Tech Industry are trying to switch to a product-based company for better career growth and most of them are going through the same confusion:‘Should I opt for expert assistance for my preparation or not?’I can tell you this: It definitely fast-tracks your timeline in which you can achieve your goals. It is up to you to take that call & start your preparation journey accordingly.HeyCoachhas launched its program ‘Super 30’, a program where they accept 30 learners and help them upskill themselves in the next 4 months & get their dream job at a top product-based company.So far, the Super 30 squad has:➡️ Average CTC of 27 LPA & Highest CTC of 74 LPA.➡️ Hike of up to 500% on your base salary.➡️ Helped 200+ learners advance their career growth exponentially.Check out the program here:http://bit.ly/3ZK1kd0Kudos toPratik Kapasi(ex-Google, Razorpay) &Aditya Kamat(ex-LinkedIn) for personalizing the learning experience of several engineers & helping them achieve their goals.#collab#tech#preparation#interview#journey#mentors#mentorship#Super30#BeOneof30#HeyCoach#upskilling#dsa#systemdesign",0.9927,0.5307971014492753,6 ,50,0

Letícia Tainara Souza,15-03-2023,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, histórico de tendências e evoluções, aqui vão algumas das tendências de marketing para 2023:🤳🏻 Marketing de influência: o marketing de influência chegou pra ficar e continuará a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conteúdo para alcançar públicos específicos (Ó a base da Virginia aí, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).🎁 Personalização: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experiência personalizada e relevante, e as empresas estão investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estratégias para atender a essa demanda.📼 Vídeo marketing: o vídeo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produção de vídeo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Então investe nisso. A era dos estáticos morreu).🔊 Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas estão começando a adotar estratégias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personalização também).📩 Marketing de conteúdo: este continuará a desempenhando um papel importante na construção de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom!

Deividas Matačiūnas,15-03-2023,"March 14 will be called the Most Productive day in AI and for Large language models!! 🐦🦄🚀In one day:🤯Googlereleased PaLM API -  A new development solution for simplified and secured experimentation with Google's language models. In conjunction with the API,Googlelaunched MakerSuite, a utility designed to facilitate rapid and straightforward prototyping for developers.🤯Stanford Universityreleased fine-tuned instruction-following language model Alpaca. The model is fine-tuned onMetalarge language model called  LLaMA. Most important thing is that model has similar behaviors asOpenAIGPT-3.5 and costs around 600$. It's crazy cheap compared to other models.🤯 Biggest news yesterday was thatOpenAIfinally introduced GPT-4. What we know about the model: Multimodal means it could answer your question with text and images. They are safer and more reliable and could work and generate longer text. Also, working incredibly well on multiple choice exams. One sad thing is thatOpenAIneeds to show how the model was improved technically. You can try the model using the ChatGPT Pro version.🤯 Another great company,Anthropicreleased a next-generation AI assistant called Claude. The model is based on Anthropic’s research into training helpful, honest, and harmless AI systems. You can try this on aQuorabot service called POU (APP store).The days like this are making me very happy because the Large language models are becoming more accessible for every company.If you need help implementing AI in your company, write me in DM, and the AI Connections team will help you!!!🚀💎😎#ai#openai#google#gpt4",0.9863,0.5880312868949232,2 ,29,1

Lukas Tassanyi,15-03-2023,"🚀 Huge news!OpenAI has just launched GPT-4, the latest version of its groundbreaking AI chatbot, ChatGPT.As someone who has been building several GPT based MVPs for exciting new business ideas, I can't help but be thrilled by another upgrade to the underlying technology! 🤩What's new?Well, imagine snapping a picture of ingredients you have lying around and GPT-4 suggesting a recipe for you. 🍲That's right, GPT-4 can now respond to images, offering not only recipe ideas but also captions and descriptions.It's like having your very own personal AI assistant who can see!Moreover, GPT-4 can process up to 25,000 words (eight times more than ChatGPT) and provide human-like language responses.From writing songs, poems, and marketing copy to helping with homework, it can do it all. 🎶📝📚But it's not just about fun and games. OpenAI has even partnered with language learning app Duolingo and Be My Eyes, an app for the visually impaired, to create AI chatbots that can assist users in a more natural and intuitive way.Actually, GPT-4 is already powering Microsoft's Bing search engine, and it's expected to be integrated into other Microsoft consumer products soon.With Google opening up its own conversational chatbot, Bard, it's clear that the AI tech race has begun!I can't wait to see how GPT-4 will transform our lives over the coming years.Just think about what social media did to us over the last decade.And this time it's not just a new way of connecting online but an entire general-purpose technology transforming every industry and every aspect of our lives.Exciting times ahead 🌟- Lukas#GPT4#OpenAI#AIRevolution#FutureOfWork#Innovation#ArtificialIntelligence#TechNews",0.9328,0.5026726896292114,0,8,0
Kornel Grunwald,15-03-2023,"That is an interesting one: 'In an interview with the Financial Times, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella labelled the first generation of voice assistants “dumb as a rock”, including Cortana and Siri from Apple and Alexa and Google Assistant from Google. When asked about voice assistants in 2016, Nadella reportedly said “Bots are the new apps”.'I can follow the logic that the promise of voice bots fell short of expectations and how GPT-related innovation is finally realizing a portion of that potential. But the big gap is still missing. And it was not about 'dumbness' that made bots really annoying.A few years ago, voicebots took centre stage with the promise of revolutionizing customer service and user experience. However, their limited understanding of natural language, context, and complexity made them less effective than anticipated. Users often found themselves frustrated with their interactions, leading to a decline in their adoption. I have heard also how difficult it was for these companies to deal with local dialects and small language fluctuations, and do the proper job to annotate datasets with such voice samples.Then GPT enters the stage. Here are two of the ways in which GPT-powered solutions have outshined voicebots:1. Enhanced natural language understanding: GPT-based models can comprehend context and nuance.2. High-quality generation: GPT-powered AI can create human-like responses.Voicebots may not have lived up to their initial hype, but GPT-related innovation has stepped in to fill that void. But does it really?We still are to see a proper missing link to be provided by new innovation: understanding of our voices.How do understand the human voice, if we just continue to speak as we do - I am not sure if you realize how unusual our patterns of speaking are. But beyond that, how tech can listen to those who struggle with some voice-related disabilities or impairments? Or how to get around the 'weirdness' of non-native speakers being fluent in the new language?These are, by far, not trivial or simple tasks, and as much as I can see the GPT revolution giving us better chances at providing great experience once voice is transcribed into text, it is still far from breaking that frontier and making our voice the main interface with technology.But considering the fact that I personally know a couple of specialists in ML/AI looking into this specific problem, I bet we are in for something big soon.Interesting times.#voice#ai",0.9621,0.3966063069721607,1 ,2,0

The audience is not engaging with their content.It might be due to 3 reasons.1. Not creating content for your target audience.It is the most common mistake new bloggers did. They generally create content that excites them. They forget about their audience.Solution: Research your target audience before you start writing blogs. Then head on to writing blogs keeping the likes and dislikes of your audience in mind.2. Not structuring your blogs.Another major problem is not structuring the blogs properly.Solution: Design your blog posts properly. Organize your blogs properly by creating an outline. I have made a post regarding the ideal blog outline that helped me to rank on first page of Google. The link to that is in the comments. Make sure to check it out.3. Your blog is not SEO optimized.SEO is an important factor for ranking on Google. You are getting lesser views because your blog is not SEO optimized.Solution: Follow SEO guidelines.

Donnacha Kirk,15-03-2023,"@OpenAI launched#GPT4, its newest and most advanced Large Language Model (LLM), yesterday to great fanfare.The launch demo had great fun showing off the ""creativity"" of the model (your mileage may vary when anthropomorphising auto-complete on steroids). I was genuinely tickled when GPT4 managed to summarise a long OpenAI blogpost (about itself, of course) into a sentence using only words beginning with the letter Q:""GPT-4 quintessentially quickens quality quantifications, quelling questionable quandaries""By far the biggest departure from previous versions is that GPT4 is no longer just a large *language* model - it can readily handle a mixed input of text and images (LL&IM?). The demo included GPT4 describing images in detail, answering questions about images and even composing the html for a website based on a hand-drawn mock-up.What seemed clear is that OpenAI's efforts remain focused on producing fast, fluent and effective outputs but not necessarily highly accurate ones. There was no attempt to quiz the model on factual questions of the kind that humbled @Google's Bard AI last month.The reality that GPT4 and similar models often produce ""close but not quite right"" outputs is not a problem in itself but it does mean that organisations trying to incorporate LLMs into their toolkits need to find new ways of working.To me, the most powerful applications right now are those where LLMs are deployed as assistants or co-pilots, boosting the productivity of highly skilled and creative humans. Think of them like Ripley's powered exoskeleton from Aliens - a machine that lets you do much more, much faster but with the human firmly in control.This approach is most advanced in the writing of code but GPT4's native incorporation of images widens the horizon - for example image and video creators can now generate descriptive text for accessibility in a fraction of the time or a photo of a sketched architecture on a whiteboard could be turned into pseudo-code in seconds.For now the limit is our imagination. Soon, no doubt the most effective uses will spread like wildfire and become table stakes, especially if the cost equilibrium remains around the current level where GPT and other language models produce output at a fraction of the cost of a human expert.The immediate challenge for organisations is: who can react most quickly? Changing our ways of working is not easy, particularly when it means your most skilled and productive workers need to spend time learning a new approach to their most fundamental tasks. The prize is a level of productivity far beyond your rivals, at least for now.#ai#gpt4#llms#openai#CISO#cybersecurity#humanriskmanagement",0.9894,0.5474390193140193,3 ,13,3

Hunger Games räknas självklart inte, eftersom den är bra.* Svamp (tryffel undantaget) är relativt överskattat som mat.* Om du själv får avgöra så är du ändå relativt trevlig som person.* Hundar är sympatiska varelser, även om de skäller så fort en ny trevlig människa ringer på dörren.* Du ser dig själv som fysiskt stark och ser det som en utmaning att se om du är starkare än Tildes mamma (det ger nämligen oerhörda pluspoäng i denna rekrytering).* Du har ganska bra koll på att SIMS 4 och Fortnite är spel (i annat fall vet du hur du kan få fram infon på Google).Vi söker just efter en personlig assistent till vår dotter Tilde, som går första året på gymnasiet och bor på Limhamn.

Ditt jobb blir att agera extra muskler till Tilde, när hennes egna inte räcker till, hänga på Emporia, fika, gå på bio mm.Ett tips inför en intervju med Tilde är att ha lite koll på tävlingsprogram på tv - i annat fall kan du göra en snabbsökning i tv-tablån innan du kommer på intervju så har du något att prata om ändå.Du behöver vara rökfri och älska djur, eftersom familjen utöver klassiska dammråttor, även har en dansksvensk gårdshund som uppskattar när även hon får vara med och busa.

Kris Laermans,15-03-2023,"Hey there! Did you hear the news? GPT4 has just been released! It's an evolution of ChatGPT based on GPT3.5, which you may already know. But this new version is even better. It allows you to be more demanding with the constraints of your questions. For instance, you can ask for each word of the answer to begin with a specific letter or tailor the answer to a targeted audience. Plus, it can take into account important content like documents of several dozen pages and answer specific questions or even make calculations based on the rules of the document.Advantage of the technologyBut wait, what is generative AI, you might ask? Well, it won't make you an expert in any domain, but it can help you become more creative by generating unique content such as music, art, and text that you may not have thought of otherwise. This can lead to new and innovative ideas and products. Plus, it can help you be more efficient by analyzing vast amounts of data and generating insights and predictions quickly, saving you time and reducing costs.Risks of not using itHowever, not using this technology today only limits the productivity potential of your company. It's like having a below-average assistant working for you for free. And who knows what the future holds? The skills of these AIs may grow to something we can't even imagine.Use casesSo, what are some use cases for Elia Group? Well, like any other company, generative AI can be used to help with writing articles, emails, and document research. But with the possibility to inject more content and provide more constraints in the questions, it could open doors to use cases such as engineering calculations based on internal documents by asking to explain each step to be checked afterward by an expert.Who is working on it?Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and many startups are all diving into this exciting technology.Do you have any ideas for using generative AI?

Almaret P.,15-03-2023,"Ok, so I have a dream!I want to see my customers thrive, because their success ultimately means mine too! I cannot succeed if they don't.Stock Management Systems are quite Expensive and although many companies have proper accounting systems, they have a hard time keeping track of their stock, because who has R100 000 a year for a proper management system licence fee?! 🤯🤯🤯For those who know me, you know what I am capable of... 😉For those of you who don't, let me give you a brief history of myself:I started as the admin grunt at a cosmetics manufacturing company where I quickly became Assistant to ALL as everything peaked my interest (Accounts, Procurement, Admin, Reception, Warehouse controller, Formulator, New Product Development, Customer Care, Production, Quality Assurance) and eventually Procurement Manager after 6 years.I got a new job at a soap manufacturing company as Operations Manager (I managed HR, Admin, Accounts, Customer Care, Procurement, Health and Safety, Quality Assurance and Production)I wrote all of the SOP's based on GMP standards and ISO 22716 (Got the certificate) and we even got almost perfect scores on our yearly Woolworths Audits due to my systems.When I started there, they had no system and didn't feel the need to put down money on a system, as they have started to grow using their current way of doing things! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 Not realizing the pitfall of not having a proper infrastructure to accommodate the new growth! (boy did I save them... 😅)I set out to Google and taught myself to program on Excel and basically wrote the equivalent of SAP's stock management ON EXCEL!During COVID I started my business to help my customers become more productive by automating Excel for them. One of my customers can now do in 10 minutes what used to take her LITERALLY the whole WEEK! 🤯She's excited to go to work now! I brought passion back in the workplace!My boss at the company I worked for's daughters need a job due to COVID and I trained them to take over from me over the next few months.I had a relatively steady income, but now I am on my own and really need customers.I have so much to give my customers, but I actually never talk about myself like this and promote my business (it really feels like I'm bragging, or people think it sounds too good to be true...)Why am I telling you this?  (Let's get back to the point right 😅)I am busy writing that Excel based Stock Management System again!And this time, it will have QA management systems in, which no current system on the market even has!Sounds amazing right? But this is where I need your support!If you would like to support me and my business, please send me a personal message.We can work out a way we can all benefit.",0.9955,0.4024738455988456,0,0,1

Holly Schmidt,15-03-2023,"Little late to the game here, but it has been a crazy past couple of weeks! On February 28th I packed up my things and moved to FRANKFURT, Germany! And then one day later on March 1st, I officially started atDeutsche Bahnas an Executive Assistant to the Head of Purchasing for Locomotives and Wagons, Rentals (officially Assistenz des Leiters Einkauf Loks und Wagen, Anmietungen) – complete with a supplier meeting on my very first day in Mainz of all places! Life moves FAST y’all!How did I get here? Late last year, I accepted a job with Deutsche Bahn – but couldn’t officially start due to some visa issues. Before I could get the paperwork in order to change jobs, I was subsequently let go fromWayfairBerlin on January 20th, 2023 – along with many other VERY talented and motivated colleagues at Wayfair. Ironically, January 20th, 2023 also marked my 3 year anniversary at Wayfair – very symbolic in a sense as I can now say that I worked at Wayfair for EXACTLY 3 years :) Soon after that, I was able to get the paperwork I needed to officially changed jobs. What followed was a lovely 5 week break that allowed me to reset, recharge and prepare to move to Frankfurt and start a new career!I’m incredibly grateful for the time I spent at Wayfair. Maybe I’m biased, but I do really do believe that my Plumbing, Hardware and Renovation suppliers are some of the BEST! From various Google Meets, phone calls and in-person meetings at the KBB Birmingham show – I’m really grateful for all the industry professionals that I have connected with. The same goes for so many of my former Category Management & Supplier Acquisition & Onboarding colleagues – thank you immensely for your support and all the learnings along the way. I am incredibly proud of what I managed to accomplish in 3 years with my Wayfair Berlin chapter!6 years ago I set out to be a Personal Assistant and somehow ended up in the world of eCommerce, Home Décor and Supplier Management! I could not be more grateful to have had the career path that I did. But, 6 years later, I am thrilled to be back on the Executive Assistant track, and I look forward to building my career at Deutsche Bahn. Literally went from “toilets to trains” with this new change of industries! Und noch was dazu – meine gesamte Arbeit ist AUF DEUTSCH! (With the occasional English supplier communication!) Admittedly it’s been quite the adjustment learning all these new train-themed German words – but each day gets better and better! And – bonus of living in Frankfurt – DIRECT flights to Chicago! No more layovers :) USA friends and family – you can start planning your visits right meow.If there is one thing I’ve learned in the past couple months, it’s that if YOU want a change in life – YOU have to make it happen! Whether it’s a job change, career change or location change (or, if you’re like me – all 3 of these at the same time) – anything is possible once you STOP asking yourself “why?!” and START asking yourself, “Why not!?”",0.9979,0.4218063754427389,8 ,34,0

Yakup Öztürk,15-03-2023,"KI wird zunehmend in Alltagssituationen eingesetzt, zum Beispiel in intelligenten Lautsprechern und Sprachassistenten wie Amazon Alexa oder Google Assistant, um Nutzeranfragen zu verstehen und darauf zu reagieren.Allerdings nutzen viele Unternehmen KI nur in begrenzten Bereichen. Eine erfolgreiche Integration von KI in den Industrieprozess erfordert einen interdisziplinären Austausch zwischen verschiedenen Parteien und kann mit Aufwand verbunden sein. Um die Vorteile von KI optimal zu nutzen, sollten Unternehmen nicht nur ihre Fähigkeit zur Datensammlung und -haltung einsetzen, sondern auch den Austausch zwischen Datenerzeugern und -nutzern fördern (Data Mesh).

Janet Jackson Seo,15-03-2023,"How does all this get a business to the top of the front page❓Google prefers to display its information at the top of a SERP (Search Engine Results Pages); therefore, entering your business into Google My Business and Maps gives them the incentive to feature you. Filling out all available fields with keywords, answers to questions, photos, and rich data will please the Google algorithms and better your chances at page one ranking. Your business can also appear in geo-location results when users are searching in your neighborhood.When it comes to keywords, local SEO might seem more targeted and less high-level; however, consider that it yields a higher ROI since searching is more than likely serious about finding, and purchasing a product or service.Research the competition in your area and see what comes up first in a Google Maps result. A helpful technique is to enter their URL into Google Keyword Planner and note associated keywords with their website. There are also several free keyword planner services to assist you.✅Keywords Everywhere Chrome Extension✅Word Tracker✅KeywordTool.ioTake those keywords as a guide to incorporate into your list.The Google Keyword Planner can show you the top keywords via search terms. For instance, if you run a yoga studio in Denver, you can search for ""yoga Denver,"" ""yoga studio Colorado,"" or ""yoga workout Denver,"" etc.When it comes to keywords for your business website, consider your Google Business Listing and coordinate with keywords of location, type of business, opening hours, and contact information.#business#data#seo#google#research#algorithms",0.964,0.46979166666666666,0,0,0

It’s like talking to an actual expert.📍Another advantage of ChatGPT is the precise nature of the responses.📍 Code debugging is also a glittering feature of ChatGPT that is hard to overlook.📍ChatGPT can double up as a virtual assistant.📍ChatGPT can adjust responses based on a slight variation in the text prompts.🔷Limitations📍One major downside of ChatGPT is that it’s limited by the data.📍ChatGPT has serious accuracy issues.📍ChatGPT cannot access the Internet.📍ChatGPT sometimes lacks variation in the provided replies.📍ChatGPT won’t be free forever?📌Advantages And Limitations Of Google Compared To ChatGPT:🔷Advantages📍Google has a massive database with all the latest information.📍Google offers you multiple avenues to seek the most suitable answer.📍 Google is capable of offering real-time information.📍Google particularly excels in offering personalized results.📍Google is Free.🔷Limitations📍Google is a search engine and doesn’t have the same language processing capabilities as ChatGPT.📍Google doesn’t act as an AI-powered virtual assistant.",0.97,0.45119047619047625,0,0,0

Tash Courtenay-Smith,15-03-2023,"Is The Answer Business Model Killing SEO and PPC?Rachel Woods on TikTok has been tracking how AI is transforming the search industry. She's highlighted is the rise of the 'answer business model,' where users no longer want to sift through links but instead want direct answers to their queries.E-commerce brands, listen up: customers ARE going to be bypassing traditional search results.BOTH SEO and PPC are likely to be challenged by the rise of AI-powered assistants and the answer business model.It might not be today, or this month, but this is going to happen.As more users look to get direct answers to their queries rather than clicking through to websites, the traditional approach to SEO may become less effective.Businesses will need to adapt to this shift by focusing on providing direct answers to users' questions and creating content that is optimised for AI-powered assistants.PPC will also be challenged by the rise of AI-powered assistants.In the last month, Instacart added a chat GBT powered grocery shopping assistant, and Shopify added a chat GBT powered shopping assistant.If users are able to get direct answers to their queries through these tools, they may be less likely to click on ads in search results.This presents a fundamental challenge to Google's search business model, which relies heavily on ads.This means that businesses will need to think creatively about how they reach their target audience, and may need to explore new channels and platforms to connect with customers.I honestly think people are in denial about what is coming, especially those heavily invested in traditional SEO and PPC tactics.AI is transforming the search landscape in fundamental ways, and businesses that fail to adapt will fall behind.Please ignore everyone on here who PPC and SEO are all fine and dandy, and everyone who says this won’t happen. It will.#ai#ppc#seo#digitalmarketing#change#search#shopify",0.5423,0.5604338842975207,7 ,7,0

Aziz Ullah,15-03-2023,"Some interesting facts aboutChatGPT AIthat are worth sharing 😲👉 ChatGPT is a language model that uses deep learning to understand and generate natural language text.👉 It was trained on a massive amount of data, including books, articles, and websites, and is capable of answering questions, completing sentences, and even generating original text.👉 ChatGPT was trained using a neural network architecture called a transformer, which was first introduced in a research paper by Google in 2017. The transformer architecture has since become the standard for training large language models.👉 The original version of ChatGPT, known as GPT-1, was released in 2018. Since then, several updated versions of the model have been released, with each iteration improving upon the previous one.👉 ChatGPT has been used for a wide range of applications, including language translation, text completion, and even generating art and music. It has also been used to develop virtual assistants and chatbots.👉 Despite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT is not without its limitations. It can sometimes generate text that is nonsensical or even offensive, and it has been criticized for perpetuating biases and stereotypes that exist in the data it was trained on.👉 Overall, ChatGPT is a fascinating example of the power of deep learning and natural language processing, and it will be interesting to see how it continues to be developed and applied in the years to come.FollowAziz Ullahfor more interesting facts 🤗#artificialintelliegence#chatgptai#chatgpt4",0.9652,0.43819875776397527,1 ,1,0

₿eter y,15-03-2023,"✅ From Dishwasher to Google and Beyond: A Father's Journey of Resilience and Determination in Pursuing New Opportunities✅As a father of a family of 5 members, embracing uncertainty can be intimidating. Nevertheless, I recently sold my home in Hong Kong to seize an opportunity with Davionlabs in Singapore, a Bybit subsidiary working on a Layer 2 blockchain network. Before accepting the offer, I thoroughly researched the company culture and management style, despite their history of significant layoffs in 2022. Most of the feedback I received from former and current employees was negative, but I believed in the company's potential and was willing to assume the risk. Regrettably, the gamble did not pay off, and I lost my job after only two months, leaving my family without a home in Hong Kong.Still, my seven years as a crypto trader have taught me to make strategic decisions and remain composed under pressure. I find similarities between this experience and the recent FTX and Silicon Valley Bank incidents, where traders and investors faced immense pressure during market plunges.Throughout my journey, I have learned valuable lessons in resilience, determination, focus, responsibility, and self-discipline. I started from humble beginnings, working as a dishwasher, lifeguard, and property agent. However, inspired by the successes of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, I taught myself to become a software engineer. I have worked in various roles across startups and big tech companies, including DevOps, SRE, and Technical Program Manager, and spent seven years in the crypto industry as a DevSecOps and algo trader.Throughout my career, I have collaborated with engineering teams to enhance application performance and scalability. I have also led global engineering teams, conducted technical interviews, built logging and monitoring solutions, and constructed CICD pipelines for numerous applications. Furthermore, I have also led global DevOps teams, conducted technical interviews from junior roles to head roles.My tenure as a Technical Program Manager at Google honed my communication and technical management abilities. As a Senior DevSecOps in a crypto exchange, I am excited to demonstrate these skills to prospective employers. I am confident that my unique background and skill set can bring value to any organization seeking a resilient, determined, and experienced employee.I am eager to explore further opportunities in Hong Kong or Singapore and would be grateful for any assistance in connecting with potential employers or HR agents.I am thankful for the chance to share my journey with the LinkedIn community. I am optimistic about my ability to contribute to any organization's success and eager to embrace new challenges.Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.#opentowork#work#opportunities#connections#softwareengineer#devops#sre#tpm#neverforgetwhyyoustarted#jobs",0.9959,0.45054450757575754,1 ,3,0

Marwa Khost Jarkas,15-03-2023,"Last year, I was approached byWIREDfor a feature related to what Tech companies are doing to ensure the Arabic language becomes more universally gender neutral.It is a BIG question for sure, as there is so much to do in that field. Arabic is a gendered language, similar to many other languages including, but not limited to, Hindi, Hebrew, French, German, Spanish, etc. For many of those gendered languages, masculine nouns and pronouns have been often used with a generic function to refer to both men and women. This being said, all languages evolve with time and the Arabic language has the appropriate means to be an inclusive language. It is on the speakers and users of the language, as well as, other responsible players (including tech companies, academic organizations, language councils etc) to take part in the evolution of the language to meet the changing needs and development of the society.Here is a quick snippet from the article.Google says it respects diversity, equality, inclusion, and integrity and encourages the expression of these values through inclusive language in its content. For Arabic, as well as other languages (particularly gendered ones), Google uses gender-neutral alternatives, enumerates both forms instead of defaulting to the universal masculine form, and feminizes job titles functions, and grades where applicable. Google Assistant also understands up to 19 colloquial Arabic languages and responds in gender-neutral Modern Standard Arabic.“We have clear inclusive language guidelines and we’re continuously trying to implement them in as many products and content types as possible,” says Marwa Khost Jarkas, communications manager at Google MENA. “Inclusive language is the language that avoids the use of expressions or words that might be considered to exclude or offend particular groups of people. In other words, it is meant to be a respectful language that is devoid of biases, stereotypes, and potentially offensive, triggering, or exclusionary language.”ThanksIain Akermanfor this opportunity and for raising this topic.What are your thoughts?EN:https://lnkd.in/dyAdJmVCAR:https://shortest.link/kxns",0.9799,0.33606701940035266,0,35,0

Ishan Kumar Giddu,15-03-2023,"AI has understood that multi-sensory engagement is as necessary as (if not more than) text.CTO of Microsoft Germany, Andreas Braun says that GPT-4 will be arriving within the next few days. GPT-4 will be the upgraded version of the GPT-3 language model that runs the current trailblazer ChatGPT.But what could be the difference? Multimodality.The word is heavy but the meaning is relatively simpler - Multimodal AI means artificial intelligence that can accept inputs, read, comprehend, and produce results in text as well as images, video and sound.If integrated in GPT-4, this could be the superior model of Google Image Search or Google Voice Search.While the rumours of GPT-4 having 100 trillion parameters or data points (for comparison, GPT-3 has 175 billion) may have been dispelled by Sam Altman, there’s no doubt that GPT-4 will have to be based on a much larger data set than its predecessor to be able to give visual outputs and to do so accurately.Accuracy will be a priority because pictures and video are visual elements that are taken in with much more keenness and scrutiny.If successful in integrating multimodality in its model, then I am sure that GPT-4 will bring in ‘NexGen content’ - content of all forms that has been developed with the collaboration of man and machine. A hint at this is Holger Kenn, Direct of Business Strategy at Microsoft Germany, saying that GPT-4 could assist call centres by automatically converting phone conversations to text and summarising them.GPT-4 could mean quick text prompts creating entire video storyboards, or picture inputs developing an in-depth video structure. It may also mean super-speedy infographics for business meetings, or quick meeting minutes extracted from a video recording - the benefits are truly far reaching!What do you think will be the best use-case of the multimodal GPT-4?#chatgpt4#gpt4#nlp#artificialintelligence#future",0.9913,0.5145555555555557,0,19,0

Auch diese könnten als Alternative zur Command Line betrachtet werden, da sie es ermöglichen, Aufgaben und Befehle durch Spracheingabe zu steuern.Trotz des Fortschritts auf vielen Gebieten, werden oftmals die Versprechen, die mit der Vorstellung solcher Technologien einhergegangenen sind, selten und meist nur in Teilen gehalten. Fakt ist, dass wir auch heute bei der Bedienung unseres Computers bei bestimmten Aktionen nicht umhinkommen, das Eingabefenster öffnen zu müssen und einen entsprechenden Befehl dort einzugeben.👉  Warum? Weil es eben notwendig ist.Ähnlich verhält es sich mit RPA. Natürlich werden wir in der nächsten Zeit immer ausgeklügeltere und noch “Low codigere” Schnittstellenlösungen bekommen, um unsere Abläufe zu automatisieren. Es wird aber immer die Notwendigkeit geben, an der ein oder anderen Stelle in einem Prozess einfach direkt mit der Oberfläche interagieren zu können.Wir wissen alle, dass es in Unternehmen immer wieder Situationen gibt, in denen Prozesse ineffizient sind. Das wird sich auch in Zukunft nicht sonderlich ändern. Selbst wenn es technisch gesehen nicht mehr notwendig wäre, RPA zu verwenden, wird es wahrscheinlich noch lange existieren, wenn es aus Unternehmensgründen, Zeitmangel oder kommerziellen Gründen keine andere Möglichkeit gibt.RPA ist nur eine von vielen Optionen zur Prozessautomatisierung und wird in Zukunft weiter existieren, auch wenn es in 10 Jahren möglicherweise anders heißt.

Fortunatos - In-House Marketing Agency,15-03-2023,"🙄 Why did Google abandon AI two years ago?Two years ago, developers Daniel De Freitas and Noam Shazir developed the most powerful chatbot at the time. However, Google management denied them access to the chatbot to other researchers, an attempt to integrate it into the virtual assistant Google Assistant, and a public demonstration.The company argued its position that the program does not meet the standards for the safety and fairness of the AI system.The developers left Google in 2021 and are developing their ownCharacter.Aiproject.After the release of ChatGPT, Google did return to the idea of its own chatbot, partially based on the technology developed by De Freitas and Shazir. But the company doesn't seem to mind the lost time. The management of the company is convinced that they create a product for years, and it must meet all the strict safety rules.Do you think Google has lost its golden age?#technology#ai#management#safety#project#google",0.5656,0.4341666666666667,0,2,1

Levent Bulusan,15-03-2023,"Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was a manager named John who worked at a prominent bank. John was known for his efficiency and dedication, but he always felt that there was more he could do to improve his productivity. Little did he know that his wish was about to come true, thanks to the integration of generative AI tools in Google Workspace.John started his day with a hot cup of coffee while going through his inbox, which was usually filled with numerous emails from his team, other departments, and clients. Before the AI integration, he would spend a significant amount of time drafting responses to each email. However, now Gmail's AI-powered email composition tool was there to lend him a hand.As he opened an email from a team member asking for guidance on a complex transaction, Gmail's AI instantly provided a suggestion that perfectly addressed the concern. John felt a sense of relief as he accepted the suggestion and moved on to the next email, saving valuable time.Later that day, John had to prepare a performance report for his team. Instead of struggling with data analysis, he opened Google Sheets and found that the generative AI had automatically identified trends and presented visualizations for him. This allowed him to focus on the implications of the data and devise strategies to improve his team's performance.During a video conference with a client, John used Google Slides to present a proposal for a new financial product. The AI in Slides had helped him design a visually appealing and persuasive presentation by suggesting suitable images, graphics, and text formatting based on the content. The client was impressed, and the meeting concluded with a successful deal.Throughout the day, John noticed that the AI tools seemed to understand his preferences and style better, as they adapted to his choices and made increasingly relevant suggestions. He appreciated how the AI enhanced his communication, reduced misunderstandings, and personalized his experience.At the end of the day, John reflected on how the generative AI tools in Google Workspace had transformed his daily tasks. His work had become more efficient, allowing him to focus on higher-level managerial responsibilities. He felt grateful for the AI's assistance and was excited to see how it would continue to evolve and support him in his role as a bank manager.#ai#work#gmail#google",0.9971,0.5489337822671156,0,2,0

The feature will enable auto-generated images, creative brainstorming, summarizing, and auto-generated emails.👉 MakerSuite - to iterate on prompts, augment dataset with synthetic data, and easily tune custom models.

We’ll be discussing how they are using a mixture of communication channels and approaches designed to increase engagement in their multi-year strategy. Early on in their journey, an aspect they felt was important was measuring how colleagues feel about the changes being implemented as a result of the transformation. They use the Kubler-Ross change curve as a guide.Using the Change Journey Navigator insights tool, they are able to establish the impact of the changes by monitoring how the communication is landing with colleagues and thereby understand where to focus attention to improve clarity and increase engagement.An important end result is to have everyone across the company feeling they are part of the change, empowered to re-imagine their roles to better serve their customers, their suppliers and each other.Click for more info on the event:https://lnkd.in/eG8mNgr7For more information on Change Journey Navigator go to:https://lnkd.in/e8muSMGT",0.9643,0.565625,0,0,0

Victor Castro,15-03-2023,"Buy with prime fromAmazon...After a snarky comment in my friendRick Watsonpost this morning, I figured i should at least provide constructive feedback.I'm my opinion, BWP has a viable path to growth and scale. Their problem is that it only takes value from brands while providing no incrementally to a merchant. It says a lot about Amazon's lack of understanding of the D2C space - I think most folks don't realize how little Amazon knows in the space. Building a large successful marketplace is not the same skill setThere are 2 things Amazon can do and adoption would scale very quickly:1. Drive traffic: The fees paid for BWP should give you some credit/access to buy advertising on Amazon that pushes traffic to their owned ecom property2. Be a true commercial partner: share customer data from buyers of the brands products on Amazon. The customer data sharing can't be one way.BWP has the potential to be an interesting play for Amazon. You could squint and see a network of high quality merchants, that solve the merchandising quality problem Amazon currently has. BWP could be a subset marketplace of curated brands, that could then also drive an ad premium.I'm leaving aside the customer experience for now because honestly it's irrelevant until they can reach scale. I can't imagine any brand customer will use this more than once in it's current iteration.if you think this is a bad/negative take, wait until you hear what I think aboutShopifyShop... initiative.",0.9592,0.5407983193277311,1 ,4,0

Michael Watson,15-03-2023,"In February 2021, Spotify announced a policy that allowed their employees to work from anywhere. Spotify's results at the 18-month juncture are summarized in the World Economic Forum video (link is below).A few highlights of the impact of this change include:Staff turnover dropped by 15%. This is probably the result of employees having access to a desirable level of flexibility.Between 2019 and 2021, women in leadership increased from 25% to 42%. In surveys, women have indicated less interest in coming into an office to work and greater interest in balancing their personal life and work responsibilities. The work from anywhere policy meets those needs.Black and Hispanic staff grew from 12.7% to 18%. Another advantage of this policy is that it enables Spotify to recruit employees from anywhere in the country, without the requirement of moving to a central location. If everything is equal, an organization that allows you to take a new job while remaining near family and friends is more attractive than a job offer that requires you to move. This policy makes recruiting and retaining diverse staff easier.This new policy does not appear to have affected Spotify's subscriber growth. At the end of January, Spotify became the first music streaming service to surpass 200 million paid subscribers.Spotify has demonstrated what is possible when you offer policies that meet the needs of employees.https://buff.ly/3Lo823V#leaders#leadership#managers#management",0.9618,0.4149350649350649,0,4,1

Keith Watson,15-03-2023,"CISA issued a recovery script for systems affected by the ESXiArg vulnerability and ransomware attacks. It is a pretty simple shell script, but the greater point is that the organization has offered this type of recovery tool at all.In the past, most government organizations have taken a hands-off approach to assisting victims, other than investigations of criminal activity. This new approach is welcome, I think, because the market hasn't produced accepted options for recovery tools. Of course, you can engage, and probably should engage, your cyber insurance and incident response providers when help is needed. CISA is offering another tool to help in the recovery process.I hope CISA continues to provide the notices, active scanning, and recovery help moving forward.",0.9688,0.5486688311688311,0,0,0

The report reiterates that firms must continue to embed PRA supervisory expectations and prioritise building the necessary capabilities to manage climate risks effectively. Doing so could involve:•	Further investment in training.•	Building up stress and scenario analysis capabilities.•	Enhancing governance structures to ensure effective oversight of climate risks.The report notes that firms need sufficient controls to avoid requiring a greater quantum of capital.The report highlights the need for firms to take climate risks seriously and build the necessary capabilities to manage them effectively to comply with regulatory expectations and protect their businesses from potential financial losses associated with these risks.To learn how ORIC International supports its members on climate-related risks, scenario analysis, and capital benchmarking, contactenquiries@oricinternational.comtoday.

Only 1 out of every 3 neurodivergent Canadian is employed. ""Unhireable,"" they are deemed, or ""too expensive to accommodate.""So let's talk business:💡 A report by JPMorgan Chase found that professionals in its Autism at Work initiative made fewer errors and were 90% to 140% more productive than neurotypical employees.💡 A report by Deloitte found that companies with inclusive cultures were six times more likely to be innovative and agile.💡 Thanks to Silicon Valley, the technology that rules everything around you is in large part the product of ND ingenuity.Companies like SAP, HP, Microsoft, Willis Towers Watson, Ford, and EY have reformed their HR processes in order to tap into neurodiverse talent.

Be My Eyes is at the forefront of developing new ways to serve the blind and low-visioned community, and we are proud to launch a brand new feature: Virtual Volunteer™, powered byOpenAI’s new GPT-4 language model. I've seen this in action, and it is AWESOME. We are in beta now, and the blind and low-visioned community, through Be My Eyes, will help shape this great leap forward for world-wide accessibility.Users can send images via our app to an AI-powered Virtual Volunteer, which will answer any question about that image and provide instantaneous visual assistance for a wide variety of tasks. What sets the Virtual Volunteer tool apart from other image-to-text technology available today is superior recognition and context, a deeper level of understanding, and a conversational ability not yet seen in the digital assistant field. For example, if a user sends a picture of the inside of their refrigerator, the Virtual Volunteer will not only be able to correctly identify what’s in it, but also extrapolate and analyze what can be prepared with those ingredients and offer a recipe - almost instantaneously.This is the result of immense hard work and forward thinking byAndré,Aske,Jesper,Hans,Bryan,Christian, our CEOMichaeland the entire Be My Eyes team. We think it is a great step forward for the community we are proud to serve, and we have created a waiting list in our app where people who are blind or low-vision can sign-up to test drive the Virtual Volunteer tool.If you want to learn more visit our blogpost.https://lnkd.in/gEB5q8yZ.#community#accessibilitymatters#Inclusion#AI#CSUN2023",0.9679,0.6092121212121212,7 ,53,4

Karen W. Smith,15-03-2023,"Black women’s hair is 2.5x more likely to be perceived as unprofessional. Because of this, 2/3 of Black women change their hair for a job interview. The pressure is even higher for young professionals, as nearly half (44%) of Black women under 34 feel pressured to have a headshot with straight hair.Bias and discrimination against natural hairstyles in the workplace remains a systemic problem, with a disproportionate impact on Black women. No one should be denied access to employment opportunities or professional advancement because of their hair. That’s why Dove co-founded the CROWN Coalition to help make race-based hair discrimination illegal through the CROWN Act. We’ve made great progress, but there’s still work to be done.I’m excited to announce that Dove is partnering with LinkedIn–the world’s largest professional network–in support of the CROWN Act, to create more inclusive and equitable spaces for Black hair at work. Dove will continue to drive awareness for the CROWN Act, encourage petition signatures, and advocate for legislation to end hair discrimination nationwide, and together with LinkedIn, take a series of actions to help end race-based hair discrimination in the workplace:Provide free access to 10 LinkedIn Learning courses focused on creating a more equitable work environment, with a goal to educate 1 million hiring managers and professionals by the end of 2023.Illuminate the real and measurable adverse impact hair discrimination continues to have on Black women in the workplace through the CROWN 2023 Workplace Research StudyAmplify the real stories and voices of Black women to help redefine what society deems “professional” for the workplaceTogether, we are reinforcing and celebrating that#BlackHairIsProfessional.Join us in taking action.

Juan José Mateo - Spanish SEO Writer,15-03-2023,"2013: decido irme de España ante la falta de oportunidades. Apenas consigo unas prácticas mal pagadas y sin ningún tipo de beneficio. Hago las maletas y me voy a Argentina.2014: me echan de mi primer trabajo en agencia, no supero el periodo de prueba, es primer trabajo desde que estoy en Buenos Aires (bueno, mi primer trabajo, a secas). Me costó encontrarlo 6 meses.2015: doy el salto a otra agencia, esta vez con un gran cliente (enorme, más bien), pero me pagan una miseria. Paso un año durísimo a nivel económico, aunque aprendo una barbaridad. Me adapto al país, comienzo a hacer amigos.2016: doy el salto a una multinacional, esta vez con un sueldo digno. Me ascienden antes de cumplir el año y me convierto en líder de área. Doy un salto a nivel económico y de responsabilidad. Ya estoy plenamente adaptado.2018: rechazo una gran oferta para ser líder regional de otra multinacional. Decido volver a Europa. Me despido de grandes amigos, es duro. Me voy directo a Escocia. Empiezo en un trabajo random de subtitulado de videojuegos. Me pagan poco y es inestable. Me cuesta encontrar otro trabajo, pero lo logro y termino en otra agencia.2019: el trabajo no es lo que esperaba y me voy de Glasgow. Viajo a España, comienzo en el mundo freelance. Intento montar una agencia con otros profesionales, pero no sale bien.2020: sigo como freelance, pero ahora contratan mis servicios grandes marcas. Lo hago todo a la sombra, sin firmar nada, sin crear mi marca personal.2022: despierto del letargo. Comienzo a desarrollar mi marca, mi método, y empiezo a formar a otras personas con todo lo que he aprendido como copy y como profesional. Consigo el tan ansiado equilibrio dinero-trabajo-tiempo libre.2023: continúo con mi estrategia. Gane, pierda, tenga pereza o haga frío. En 9 meses doblo mi cantidad de seguidores y consigo 2 MM de impresiones. Lanzo mi newsletter y comparto contenido a diario. Sigo aprendiendo, enseñando y conectando. Otros profesionales comienzan a notar los beneficios de mis asesorías.Una verdadera montaña rusa.Pero la vida es esto.Altibajos.Y eso es algo que todos tenemos que pasar, a menos que hayas nacido en cuna de oro, en cuyo caso este post no te va a despertar nada.Pero si no es así, si has tenido que ganarte lo que disfrutas hoy, sabes perfectamente que el camino siempre es complicado.Y si todavía estás en ese camino, este post es un aviso de que vas a tener momentos malos, momentos regulares y momentos buenos.Puedes optar por tirar la toalla ante la primera adversidad.O puedes tomarlo como parte del camino y seguir el consejo de mi camiseta.Te aseguro que si optas por lo segundo, va a valer la pena.Mucho.P.D. Me encantaría conocer tu historia en comentarios. A veces tenemos miedo a contar lo que hemos pasado para llegar dónde estamos, cuando en realidad es lo más inspirador que podemos regalarle a otra persona.#trayectoria#mihistoria",-0.9186,0.5,273 ,"1,719",52

At the same time it is also impossible to bring what you want when you hold so much fear about the outcome you don't want.Remove your personal investment of fear from what you don't want to happen, and now use that powerful energy and direct it to what you want.No matter what you have been thinking or feeling, your power to create somethings new is NOW.#thesecret",0.4404,0.5799586776859504,0,0,0

Being a part of the Women in Higher Education Career Acceleration Program I met the most amazing set of women I didn’t even know exist in the same institution that I work at.  Before this programme my aim was invisibility - get in to work, do my thing, get out.  It worked perfectly fine until I realised I was completely lost and was going nowhere (professionally) fast.The last couple of days have taught me the importance of visibility, self-accountability, self-awareness, emotional-intelligence, love of self (the list is endless).  Thank youWHEN: Women's Higher Education Network.  I am actually thinking about myself again - the first time in a very long time.

With paradigm shifting international programmes such as the AUKUS submarine deal and the Global Combat Air Programme, ambitious and rigorous investments in future capabilities are a necessity. The war in Ukraine has changed the world, and the UK must be pro-active in facing threats.And yet, whilst this is a good step forward, there is yet more to do. Our army’s equipment lags behind many of our NATO allies. The threats since the original iteration of the Integrated Review have dramatically increased. Greater, bolder commitments are needed to deliver the support our armed forces need.”https://lnkd.in/ePWYnVYE#ukmanufacturing#ukmfg#springbudgetJames WatsonKelly MaddisonSamantha HillEstelle ExelbyMaria WinsperCharline DiomandeJames V.",0.9578,0.4661764705882353,0,11,1

Letícia Tainara Souza,15-03-2023,"Hey, LinkedIners! Analisando as plataformas digitais, comportamento do consumidor, histórico de tendências e evoluções, aqui vão algumas das tendências de marketing para 2023:🤳🏻 Marketing de influência: o marketing de influência chegou pra ficar e continuará a crescer! Com mais marcas colaborando com influenciadores e criadores de conteúdo para alcançar públicos específicos (Ó a base da Virginia aí, gente! Ela vendeu 150 mil unidades em um fim de semana mesmo com os haters).🎁 Personalização: os consumidores continuam desejando uma experiência personalizada e relevante, e as empresas estão investindo cada vez mais em tecnologia e estratégias para atender a essa demanda.📼 Vídeo marketing: o vídeo continua sendo uma das formas mais populares e eficazes de marketing, e as empresas devem continuar a investir em produção de vídeo de alta qualidade para atrair e engajar os consumidores (Quer engajar? Então investe nisso. A era dos estáticos morreu).🔊 Voice marketing: com o crescente uso de assistentes virtuais como Siri, Alexa e Google Assistant, muitas empresas e marcas estão começando a adotar estratégias de marketing por voz para se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz (aqui entra a personalização também).📩 Marketing de conteúdo: este continuará a desempenhando um papel importante na construção de marcas e no envolvimento com os consumidores. As empresas precisarão investir em conteúdo de alta qualidade e em estratégias de distribuição para se destacar em um mercado cada vez mais competitivo.🎯 Marketing omnichannel: os consumidores esperam uma experiência perfeita e consistente em todos os canais de marketing, e as empresas precisam se adaptar a essa demanda, criando estratégias de marketing omnichannel integradas. O seu consumidor está em todos os canais e é inteligente pensar em estratégias adaptadas em cada um deles.🎲 Marketing baseado em dados: as empresas estão cada vez mais usando dados para entender e se comunicar com os consumidores de maneira mais eficaz. As empresas devem continuar a investir em tecnologia e estratégias de análise de dados para obter insights mais precisos e informados sobre seus clientes (segura os prints).🤖BÔNUS TRACK: Uso de AI em estratégias e materiais publicitários também é algo que não tem volta - e que bom! Se você é um profissional da área, sugiro começar a integrar programas como MidJourney, ChatGpt, IBM Watson, Salesforce Einstein, Amazon Rekognition, DeepCrawl, Wibbitz e entre outros nas suas campanhas, estratégias e tomadas de decisão. Pois como diz a famosa música de fim de ano de uma emissora de TV por aí, ""hoje é um novo dia, de um novo tempo que começou. Todos os nossos sonhos, serão verdade e o futuro já começou"".#marketing#tecnologia#amazon#empresas#salesforce#marketingsensorial#marketing2023#marketingderelacionamento",-0.3956,1.0,3 ,6,0

Rick Watson,15-03-2023,"5 Scary Things I Learned While Shopping Amazon Buy With PrimeI've been surprised so many people talking about Buy With Prime, but few of them actually have even ever looked at it, much less purchased from a seller with it.  I decided to remedy that.To make it easy on Amazon, and perhaps prove a point, I decided to throw them a softball.  Let's purchase from their case study accounts.  Here's what I learned.  In the comments, I have the full report and a link to signup to my newsletter which will release it this morning.  (So signup to get future content like this!)Note when I say all their sellers  I mean all their case study sellers.1 - All their sellers are using FBA vs their white-label MCF shipping.This means the packaging is bad, undifferentiated, and worse than any typical premium D2C experience.2 - All their sellers are using Shopify.If you wonder why Amazon needs to sign a deal with Shopify, look no further.  In the sweet-spot of D2C small and medium businesses that Buy With Prime could help, anecdotally I find like 90% of these people are using Shopify.So yeah, Amazon must get a deal done.3 - Buyers need to agree to Amazon's privacy policyThis is not just about fast delivery, then.  (Which was fantastic!) This is about data-sharing.I doubt this would even work in Europe.4 - I never got a branded e-mail from a Shopify store.When I was contacted during the purchase experience, they were all from either Amazon itself, or ""Amazon Pay"" (to be honest, I am not sure why there is a difference the consumer should see).Only one brand in all my purchases sent me a single email before I got the item, and it was to tell me they had created an account for me, and to reset my password for it.Thanks for nothing?5 - Returns were hard.  Like super-hard.Both Amazon customer service and the D2C brands I purchased from could barely find these orders in their database, much less tell me how to return them successfully.I did not feel like I had an ""A to Z Guarantee.""Suffice to say, if I were a buyer of a brand, there is zero advantage to buying with Buy With Prime for the same item that could be on Amazon.  In fact, if the item is already on Amazon, Buy With Prime on a D2C website adds significant friction.If the item is not on Amazon, then you lose the ease of your typical D2C experience.👇👇Want more?
