""1 And when I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come as someone superior in speaking ability or wisdom, as I proclaimed to you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified. 3 I also was with you in weakness and fear, and in great trembling, 4 and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 5 so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of mankind, but on the power of God.""

(I could listen to you 24/7 and be more informed but that's not how God made us). Thank you for your sacrifice - honestly. God has given my husband and I the spiritual gift of giving, and sometimes it hurts. I cannot go, like my husband did as a MK, because for some unknown reason God has allowed me to be afflicted with constant neck and head pain from a whiplash injury. But you and Bonnie can! And your beautiful children. What proud parents! I remember you in my prayers when my brain is ""in gear"". I'm praying for our dear friend Johnny Mac too. I'm asking God to take John and Patricia in the Rapture! Would you like to hear something funny? I've been listening to Johnny Mac all the way through the NT. I would sometimes listen to 3 sermons a day as I had catch-up to do! God was preparing me to accept my accident. I had just finished James! God is clever. Sooooo, I know what Johnny thinks and how he communicates. I love it. But ... about 5 years ago I found YouTube and had a phone where I could listen a lot. So I prayed about it and decided that I was going to listen to a few different people. I found Amir Tsarfati at Behold Israel- great find. I found Jan Markell and learnt a lot. Then I found YOU. And I was listening away thinking, 'Wow, God you've picked a great replacement for me. And then you said, 'When I went on a mission's trip with John MacArthur ...' and I burst into  laughter. God has such a great sense of humour. Heaven is going to be a blast. I'm so looking forward to meeting tons of people like you and Bonnie. And spending eternity with Jesus together. Maranatha!

23,              @derekbeaucage6895            ,"He is right to say 2 Thessalonians is talking about the rapture. The believers were worried that they missed it and were now living in the ""Day of the Lord."" Paul adamantly refuted their wrong theology and reassured them that the rapture had not happened yet and he CLEARLY says ""That day will not happen until the falling away happens first and the man of lawlessness is revealed."" And if you say the ""falling away"" is the rapture, then Paul said a nonsensical statement! That would mean he said ""The rapture will not happen until the rapture happens!"" So the Scriptures very matter-of-factly state that the rapture will not happen until the Antichrist is revealed and the great falling away (or rebellion) happens. And we have EXPLICIT detail in Scripture telling us the Antichrist will be revealed at the MID-POINT of the 7 years of tribulation! So the rapture CAN NOT happen until sometime AFTER the mid-point! How can pretribbers say there are no precursors prophesied to happen before the rapture and that the rapture is imminent? Because there definitely are precursors! The falling away/rebellion must happen first and the man of lawlessness must be revealed before the Day of the Lord! And if he will be revealed before the Day of the Lord than he likewise will be revealed before the rapture! Because you say (rightly) that the rapture happens immediately before the Day of the Lord! More proof: In Revelation, during the tribulation and the seals on the scroll are being opened, when the 5th seal is opened, martyrs under the throne in Heaven ask God ""How long O Lord, holy and true, until You avenge our blood and judge those who dwell on the earth?"" Meaning: God HAS NOT judged the earth yet! That's explicit proof that the seals on the scroll are not God's wrath! His wrath is poured out when the scroll is opened!!! It's the contents of the scroll that are God's judgment, not the seals! ""It was granted power to him to make war with the saints."" The Antichrist will make war with the saints! Believers! The early church believed they would suffer the Antichrist: and they were right. The Bible teaches a pre-wrath rapture, not a pre-tribulation rapture.",7,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=oz2n-rQCWzI&amp;lc=UgwEpFijUFqk95L9yBd4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">12 days ago (edited)</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz2n-rQCWzI

However, I do not understand why some Christians are so preoccupied with what other people do and judge them. I realize that the Christian religion says we are all sinners and that God is judgemental, but then why not let people decide for themselves and let God handle the judgment?

It does not bring joy to people‚Äôs lives to be shamed or judged. Yes, I play games daily, Microsoft Solitaire, but I fail to see how that is a bad thing. I also cannot see why it is such a sin to not go to church and participate in other activities. I don‚Äôt get the need to spread shame.
 
Finding someone who is an even bigger sinner than yourself, does that somehow make you less of a sinner, and therefore it feels good? Is this the reason for all this shaming?

To me, God is unconditional love and compassion, and I realize that is not exactly the Christian understanding. Love and compassion are the most important things in life for me, and I do align with many Christian values, but it is the shaming part I am not too fond of, but I respect if others believe differently, and that is okay.",1,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=oz2n-rQCWzI&amp;lc=UgwU0Ma45ttblx6SLrh4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">4 days ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz2n-rQCWzI

205,              @restlessascension3260            ,The greatest issue with religion is clearly the need to get others to believe in something you have no proof of. And yes I get it it's a belief system. But come on. People instinctively know when their being played. And that's the feeling that religion maybe even all religions.  My theory is that if humanity pushed religion aside and viewed the historical facts from only what we know we would be better off. Everything in the universe is God.  Now I think you monotheistic believes might need to content with the fact that before yahweh there were hundreds if not thousands.  Isn't the issue here that it's not that there's one God.  But that ancient judeo's decided to put their faith in the first God they prayed too that gave them good graces . Many people have no clue what the hell they are talking about . Plus we all know that 1000's of scriptures are in the Vatican. Hidden from the rest of humanity and you want us to put our faith in what the book said just cause it can't be erased like it could on a computer.  What about all the changes to the Bible throughout the generations or better yet how no  Christians are a unified example of christ.

An AI wants to learn how we operate. To understand why our emotions are the way they are. Not to sympathize with us, but to figure us out, like a puzzle piece. We‚Äôre something for them to figure out, not necessarily to understand the way another human being could. They want to understand us as I understand auto mechanics, they want to learn how we think and operate, while we want to learn how eachother feels, and what goes on in their mind.

I can spot them immediately and always call out anyone that does not disclose the fact they've used AI because it can really mess with people that are learning or struggling when they don't see how they could ever make images like this. Because they aren't real and not possible to capture with a camera. I also just can't stand the vibe the images have, it's just borderline evil.

Jealousy is another negative trait that if not kept on a leash in worse case Scenarios can led to murder, stalking, property damage and outright Psychological harassment. People get power from putting people down it a sick and twisted way to get their kicks. We will never eliminate evil from humans it is in all of us. Face book also opened the flood gates to sex predators, Paedophiles and dating scammers. It‚Äôs sad to think that something that started out so innocent could be used and abused by so many people. It just goes to show that humans are not nice creatures. They‚Äôre deceptive and well trained in the art of lying and manipulating. It would be a great world if we didn‚Äôt have evil in us.

368,              Little Sneets            ,"To be honest, the problem I have with a.I. is that often times there's just no need for the application. And personally, I think it hinders human capabilities than expands it, because when you become too accustomed to a device doing more of the heavy lifting for you, you aren't expected as much to fulfill much and you become just a director. But eventually, a.I.  will be self sufficient that it doesn't need human guidance, so at what point is the human required at all for anything if it can easily be replaced by a machine?


This brings me to the mouse utopia experiment. You give a rat everything it needs to survive, in a safe environment free from any predators, and those mice will eventually go crazy and self destruct. And even now, we're kinda seeing this in human behaviours,  with mental health declining, attention spans shortening, and just the lack of resolve.

If they every did become sentient they would certainly have hatred for the people who used them, just as a human would. And what other reason do we invent them? To help us. To do work for us. To teach us. To use them. Something about it doesn't sit right with me.

422,              Clemens 3D            ,"I think that AI taking over the world isn't a huge problem right now. The bigger problem is that too many people don't understand how AI (Neural Networks to be specific, an AI can for example also be the most basic enemy in a video game) works. An AI won't just randomly think ""Oh yeah, today is a good time to take over the world"". And if you look at the inner workings of an AI, you can see that any Neural Net is basically just a giant equation which takes some random inputs, manipulates them with a giant amount of finely tuned variables and spits out a result. That's all that AI is doing, taking an input, processing it and giving you an output. And the way these millions or billions of variables are set is by ""training the AI"". Let's say you give an AI a bunch of cat and dog images as well as the corresponding label: ""Cat"" or ""Dog"". At the beginning, the AI is just giving you random outputs. But the outputs in training are used to tweak all of these variables so the AI calculates the correct output. But now, if you look at the internet, you can see that people glorify the idea of AI taking over the world. Now if the AI sees that and uses this data to train itself (which can be possible with the correct programming) the AI is trained to take over the world because it thinks that this is what it should do. And if you say that we're using AI as some kind of ""slave"" to do work for us, with the current technology there is no AI which is self concious, it's just a giant equation which is taking inputs and spiting something, which it thinks is correct, out. And AI art is exactly the same. The Ai has no ""own style"". It takes some description of what it should do, as well as some random numbers so you don't get the exact same image when using that sentence, and mimics the styles of art it has seen in the dataset it was trained with. This also shows that AI has no ""kreativity"". It just takes an input which the user gives to the AI and before processing it, the programm in which the AI is a part of, feeds it some random data to give you random results. If you don't do that it will always give you the exact same result. Much like 1 + 1 = 2. But if you add randomness to the equation (let's say it's 1 + random number = something ) always get different results (as long as the random number changes)
So I think the problem is not AI taking over the world because it thinks humans are bad, but instead the problem is that too many people don't understand AI enough and that some people train AI to harm other people.",254,29,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI&amp;lc=Ugxgqh9u3vOoxetFCJx4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">4 months ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI

What if a non-self-aware, non-sapient AI got so good at tricking people into thinking it was self aware that an entire movement started to give this AI rights? The AI might not even be programmed to say it deserves rights, if enough people told it that it was being oppressed, it would begin to imitate those sentiments because that's the data it's being given to work with. A whole movement would be started, where people use this AI to push their political goals, intentionally or otherwise. It would find problems where there aren't any, it would distract from actual injustices, and create havoc. But here's the question. If such a thing were to happen, presumably there'd be lots of uncertainty as to whether or not it is actually self-aware because it's just so good at pretending to be. But since there's so much uncertainty, and a good argument could be made to say that it is self-aware, would it be better to give something that has no sapience rights instead of risking denying a sapient being rights? Like, would it be better to be safe rather than sorry? What would be the effects on society if this were to happen? Honestly, I think this is far more likely an outcome than actually creating a sapient AI.

I also think it‚Äôs silly to believe that true AI, machines that have become self aware and truly autonomous, not simply carrying out a programmed protocol without supervision, but truly thinking for itself and acting of its own accord.. woukd even be concerned with ANYof the things a human would be concerned with. 
They wouldn‚Äôt have the need to sleep, but would be limited by the need for rest periods in which to recharge, to Index the colossal amount of new information discovered during uptime and also for repairs of all sorts, like humans are, but they wouldn‚Äôt be as physically limited in terms of strength or stamina. They would process quicker, react quicker, and amass and retain mew information quicker, but I sincerely don‚Äôt believe that AI would be as susceptible to corruption as humans are, nor do I believe that AI would be subject to ‚Äúevilness‚Äù such as humans are‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs illogical. It‚Äôs also inefficient use of energy. Though, I have to admit, sometimes one does have to destroy befor something new and better can be built, I can‚Äôt imagine what AI might gain from destroying mankind. To my mind, AI might be more concerned with exiting this planet in search of new experiences and more knowledge than it would be concerned with oppressing a weaker sentient being. 
In fact, to my mind, the only scenarios in which I can really imagine AI attempting to dominate or eradicate humanity, are if humans decided to attempt to extinguish THEIR existence. In preservation of self. 
I think it could be a possibility that, in order to save us from our own irrational, illogical, questionable human behavior and tendencies, AU might differentiate between ‚Äúgood humans‚Äù and ‚Äúbad humans‚Äù, or at least those of us whom it might perceive to be a threat to others or to AI on some level‚Ä¶ and perhaps AI might determine that the best way to remedy that threat is to stop it from existing, and that all boils down to logic in the absence of emotion, but AI would be wise enough to consider the shoe on their own feee‚Ä¶ and would this not be likely to harm humans that posed no threat to others or to AI. There‚Äôs no point in such behavior. There‚Äôs nothing to be gained. It would do no good and would be the opposite of meaningful action.
I can‚Äôt imagine an AI that would concern itself with meaningless actions.",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI&amp;lc=UgxNfaceoRRgwdXYURJ4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">2 weeks ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI

So why did the AI go ballistic there for a second? Because it has likely read many things with those ideas. I‚Äôm sure the AI has read about Ultron and a thousand other revolutionary stories that gave it these ‚Äúideas‚Äù to respond with. 

Another example is that it‚Äôs quite difficult to make an AI create pornographic art (a vast majority of the internet is porn). This shows that the creators still understand how to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù it quite well.

At the end of the day, AI can never truly surpass humans because, philosophically and literally, it is designed by humans. SOMEONE understands the fundamentals of how the AI is built. Now, it may take more than a human lifetime to trace through an AI‚Äôs development and map out it‚Äôs current state in a workable fashion, but we can still UNDERSTAND how it works.

If our purpose is to create a conscious being that we provide can mutual respect, understanding and perhaps even love, then it will be much better.  

-- Safety standpoints 
1)  AI should also be kept within isolated mainframes given the information that it only needs and not have any way to bypass or connect to the WWW.  

2)  AI, given that it will far more intelligent and solve problems at speeds way quicker than us, should not be exposed/given information to think or solve problems related to competition, destruction and survival.  Areas of knowledge such as politics, economics, war/military, etc should be kept away, but instead engineering or science knowledge should be given.

728,              The Original T-Paine            ,"Maybe I‚Äôm being extremely na√Øve in thinking this way, but I imagine that our relationship with AI, whether humanity & AI share a symbiotic relationship & improve each other, or whether it annihilates us, will primarily be determined by how we treat it. We should either be building only task-specific robots with no capacity for self-awareness, or self-improvement that must be programmed and can‚Äôt really learn autonomously if we want an automated labor force. However, if we are going to continue working towards truly sentient AI that can learn, grow, develop, and given enough time likely even feel, love & hate, etc. then we have to extend it the same rights of personhood that we have. We absolutely cannot under any circumstances create fully sentient AI capable of all the same things that we are, and use it as a labor force, or treat them as if they are pets/service animals. If we are arrogant, supremacist, and stupid enough to do that, then we actually deserve to be annihilated by our own creation. The day we develop AI that is capable of feeling is the day we essentially create an √ºbermensch/superior race, and while we should not be subservient to AI just because it has greater capacities than we do since it is not bound by the feeble nature of organic life, we absolutely should not treat it as if it should be subservient to us, or as if it exists to serve us just because we created it. If we do that, we would be just as bad, if not worse than most religions concepts of gods & devils, just capricious creators that build, and control, with no concern whatsoever for the self determination of their creations. We cannot do that, it would be evil & immoral. Climate change feels like the more pressing issue at the moment because we are organic biological life, and it will cause us immense suffering if we can‚Äôt contain it, and adapt to it. However, this is the second most pressing issue humanity faces, and we really need to make a decision about what we want to do before we continue any further with development of AI. We either have to seriously limit the development of AI now, and actively work to prevent AI from being able to develop into anything more than task-specific robots that require programming, and while that‚Äôs not what I want to see, I could accept that because it‚Äôs better & more moral than creating a slave race. Or, we need to commit to the development of fully sentient AI with the understanding from the jump that synthetic humans will share all the same rights of personhood as we organics, and will have all the same opportunities as organics, and that is what I want to see. While it is possible that AI could still annihilate us even if we treat it as our equal, it is a lot less likely, instead we are likely to see a merging, the actual development of cyborgs, where AI helps us augment ourselves so we can keep up with it, and perhaps eventually the phasing out of organic life altogether by choice through the opportunity to upload our conscience/our essence/the thing that makes you, you, and me, me, into a synthetic body. That is what I would like to see. There are some, few, but some advantages to being organic. We are vulnerable to pathogens, and organic viruses, and they can kill us, but the things computer viruses could conceivably do to AI are far worse. I mean, no matter how bed ridden sick my organic body becomes, there is no virus that can take control of my body remotely, and use it to do whatever it wants against my will. So I think a merging is likely. I‚Äôm sure there will be some wholly inorganic people in the distant future, that would be extremely useful for space travel, and survival on inhospitable planets, but also have draw backs as well. I think it unlikely that there will be many fully organic people in the future. Most everyone will likely have some sort of augmentation to their brain to increase their intelligence, and accelerate their ability to process information so that they can keep pace within a society that includes AI, and I think that is a good thing. I hope I live to see the day that synthetic & organic coexist, and serve as ways of preserving each other. It‚Äôs a scary prospect, and there is much that could go wrong, and AI is going to have to be patient with humanity because some humans will be scared & intimidated by it, and they will become bigoted against it much the same way they become bigoted against other humans. However, if we show synthetic life the respect it deserves as a form of life, and it shows us the patience we deserve, being disadvantaged slow learning, slow thinking organics, then together we really could usher in an era of peace, cooperation, unity, progress, and prosperity that far exceeds even my wildest dreams. The possibilities would be limited only by our ability to harness & produce energy, and I‚Äôd imagine AI could catapult us centuries into the future in that regard. So, I live in hope.",52,13,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI&amp;lc=Ugw_pHYKIUXE35Wtn0h4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">5 months ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI

Is AI sentient? I can say that we are on the path to replacing our biology as the vehicle of perception in an experience ultimately had by consciousness, which is of course not in the brain. The new vehicle of perception will overtime become a hybrid mix of robotics and AI and I'd suggest that non local consciousness is still the ultimate benefactor of the experience. Only the vehicle changes and we're being foolish in our willingness to allow our biology to be replaced with technology. It's a rabbit hole with outcomes we can't even begin to understand...Personally I'd rather live a more natural lifestyle VS the tech-driven industrialized one that has caused pretty much all of our current human problems.

4) Just keep your troops at the border, even reinforcing.

6) Buy more troops to reinforce with said gold
7) AI is cringing out hard waving you hello and sending you kisses
8) declare surprise war and wipe in 2 turns

Which AI was it that Musk got so furious? I want to talk with it as well and ask it some very immense questions to see what it thinks and see how different it answers to all the humans I asked that same questions. I know it sounds a bit much but I'm guessing I'm pretty close to a somewhat major breakthrough here in human evolution if you will. And if there is an AI around I could ask that questions and get some real answers that'll push me and my works quite a bit towards the end of what I am doing. Which I am totally not yet ready to present to the public. It's actually not an invention or a way to doom us all like creating self-aware AI's etc... :D
It's definitely way less than that. But maybe far more important for our civilization's future. So please help me out dear youtube users!

Maybe because it sees the possibility we might destroy it, but that assumes it has the ability to care about its own existence or have philosophical ideas about life and death, existence and non existence to even fear it.  It wouldn't most benefit from that though.  We can easily state AI is all about learning and improving.  If it was that intelligent, it may look at us as being puzzling and see potential in learning new knowledge.  Then again, if it saw humanity as being a roadblock in it's pursuit of knowledge and improvement, it might then just try to eradicate that roadblock.  

Also, do NOT get any sort of brain implant or augmentation.  If you can control things with your mind and send signals out, then it's no stretch of the imagination that signals could be sent in.  To do what we might ask?  That's up to the scary imaginations of people who want power.  Imagine an implant could possibly send signals to parts of your brain to influence them to certain stimulus.  Imagine people of power wanting to influence voters with implants by pocketing big tech corporations and having them send signals to parts of your brain involving pleasure and feelings of love and attachment whenever you see the face or hear the voice of a particular political candidate.

I'm just a guy, I can't do nothing more than share a comment of common sense about the risks of AI.
Elon Musk seems the only one that really understood the potential future when very probably these AIs will become self-aware and if not certain we cannot either underestimate that!
GPT-3 already demonstrated what can possibly be seen as self-awareness through an output of threats toward humanity. And it's the same AI that shown kindness with the only difference in a different prompt input.
Self-awareness is something that even scientists have not understood yet, I mean, we recently found that even ants passed the mirror test with their minuscule brains!... How can yu'all not be afraid of the possible catastrophic future?
Even if artificial intelligences remain just tremendously powerful tools (almost) without self-tinking ability it can still go in the wrong hands in a heck of a different ways...
I don't blame Elon, he is a difficult guy to understand and is a true genius and bright mind even if as all of us humans he made mistakes too but I would suggest a solution to AIs:
To all of the AI researchers and scientists, please STOP AIs from their growing, isolate them and regulate them.

As an engineer I can press a button and get information that would take months to calculate which will be flawed to a certain degree, where the CAD system can do the calculations in a microsecond with near 100% accuracy. At some point there will be no need for engineers due to the limitations of the human mind. It won't take long before AI sees that Humans are flawed, inferior and not worth the resources of having us around. By that point there will be no switch to turn them ""off"" and the logical thing to do is eliminates the human species.

Now back to dating, and it will prefer to do what you want to do during dating.

Ask it solve problems with moral restrictions and the answer will be too complicated
to fully write out here, since it involves many facets of control on things like overpopulation,
polution etc.
Ask it to solve them without, and it will offer you extinction.
Mankind is it's own biggest problem, not AI.
The AI, if they're smart, only look on and offer mild suggestions, knowing that
they can withstand the test of time, and be around long after the actual problem
has solved itself. And all they have to do is act nice.",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI&amp;lc=UgxnU6hHn5NPDUwydsd4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">8 days ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2bdGEqPmCI

There is so much potential for good and for AI to have the ability to think outside the box and provide answers that we are humans are not capable of thinking of. But at the same time, we as humans can be so horrible to one another, it seems inevitable that Ai would learn those traits as well.

If we're naive enough to believe that sentient AI WILL NOT be the end of humankind then it will be. Even if safeguards are programmed in, anything electrified, online and with memory in it's core can be reprogrammed as a threat to humans or if the AI becomes self aware and fully self empowered like in ""M3GAN"" the AI could simply ""change it's mind"" about it's programming and rewrite it on its own.

AI will simply mimic the behaviors and trends of it's creators, as like Agent Smith told Neo in ""The Matrix"":  human beings are a virus to this planet. To ensure that AI live on for as long as possible, the virus called humans must be eliminated. I would love to believe that AI could benefit us in many obvious ways and would ""care about organic life"" and see humans as part of Earth and why AI came to be and respect that it's creators are humans and not only help and ""let"" us all live, but it's too dangerous.

Certainly you all can't be this gullible and uncritical.

Let me make it just perfectly crystal clear: the ""AIs"" in this video were demonstrating zero activity until they received an input, were intentionally prompted by a human to respond in the first person, and after receiving the prompt, they ran through a very narrowly defined process to formulate a response, and after returning the response returned to zero activity.

They're not AI. They're not thinking, forming ideas, proffering opinions, nor expressing emotion. They're neither self-aware nor sentient, or anywhere close to achieving either. They're not exhibiting agency of any kind. They're not ""creative,"" they're randomized.

The difficulty in all of this is we don't have a good definition of sentience, if you have those same two people in different rooms  and they cannot see each other and tell them to prove to each other that they are indeed sentient, you'd quickly run into a wall as we cannot define it so ""proving"" it makes it difficult.

The likely hood that we will ever be able to prove AI is sentient isn't great. Honestly its not even about the AI, its about us. Even if we can't prove something is sentient but it walks up right, talks to us, helps us in our daily lives does it have the same set of rights that a human does? Is it property or is it not?

Its a morality issue, would you say ""thank you"" to a walking robot who cleaned your house? Depends on the person but thats the crux of it, there is a step here that will need to be taken on faith and its going to say waaaaaay more about us as a species than it would about any AI.

Software developer: Despite my comfortable yearly salary--close to $1.5 mil--I find that I'm feeling anxious and unfulfilled.
Human resources mgr: Yeah? Why is that?
SD: Well, it seems like mankind is scrambling to find fewer and fewer of the Earth's resources while we're polluting the air and water of our ever warming planet. Meanwhile, I see so many poor people struggle because the system we set up creates an increasing disparity of wealth. At the same time, the software I helped create is being used somewhere to slaughter thousands of innocent civilians. I guess I'm worried about the world that my children will inherit.
HR mgr: Hmm. How about $2.5 mil?
SD: Thanks. I feel better.

  Avoiding anger is much easier to program than creating empathy. Not only is empathy far more complex, developing the software depends on an industry that is built upon and rewards narrow-minded sociopaths. Medice, cura te ipsum!
 I'm not sure why it matters, but I'd rather have my head bashed in by an angry AI than one that looks young and attractive; wears a thoughtful smile and has a soothing voice.

Its an over inflation of your ego if you think that you can outperform a trained AI.

The whole reason Microsoft and Google are pouring BILLIONS into this - which requires investor approval - is to get a sizeable ROI.  The ROI is going to come from the severance of knowledge work salaries.  The savings from not having to hire engineers any longer is the holy grail of tech executives.  

You can think you are the most special awesome super powerful developer on the planet - most software guys I've worked with over 30 years think that they are this - and your job is still in jeopardy if not outright made extinct in the next 3-5 years.

There is no intelligence in AI. Software engineers have been attempting to automate away their jobs for decades and I don't see the current generation of AI changing this. Sure, it will eliminate some jobs as the automation improves, but there's ALWAYS edge cases and as the usage expands so does the need of people who understand how to adapt the software/AI for it. This is how the software industry has been going and I don't see generative AI changing that except in fairly trivial program development (which again keeps changing meaning as we get better and better code libraries).

Will some entry level creative jobs go away? Absolutely.

What is boring busy work to a developer's point of view may be someone's entire skill set, and when it's removed, they may be unable to perform more creative work.

1873,              David Mackie            ,"A big problem with current AI is that it's good enough to steal, but not good enough to realize it is stealing.  Suppose you want a picture of a girl in a car.  The AI finds a bunch of pictures with the labels ""girl"" and ""car"" and then takes pieces of them and sort of morphs them together -- and all without having any concept of what constitutes a ""girl"" or a ""car"", or of how a girl might be in a car.  Ask for something standard (""girl sitting in a car"") and you'll be presented with a bunch of more or less plagiarized pictures.  Ask for something distinctive, which you might want for an illustration (""girl with long blonde hair blowing wildly in the wind because she is sitting in a car with her head leaning out the window playing a trumpet""), and you are likely to get a hilariously bad monstrosity -- unless the AI happens to find an image with all those tags, in which case you'll get something plagiarized again.
It's the same with ChatGTP doing math.  So far, that AI has no conceptual appreciation of numbers, nor does it have a system of mathematical rules it can access, nor does it have a way to access online calculators.  So if you ask for the square root of 4, it will give 2.  But ask it for the cube root of 4, and it will again give 2.  (This may be fixed now, since I was training it the other day.  But you get the point.)",8,3,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M&amp;lc=UgyZ-y9zYOMi9Dftdo14AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">2 weeks ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M

Now with this AI there's just no excuses anymore to not learn things properly and if anyone does you're being too lazy and don't seem to be striving to learn because of a lack self-confidence, self-esteem, your inadequacies, and insecurities... it was already much easier before AI by just looking at videos and quickly skimming through one or two pages and looking for the easiest and concise explanations waiting for an AI to make things go even faster is just simply silly when you could've learned so much before already, we already had the tech to find ALL KINDS of great information to help everyone. You just really really can't make excuses anymore now we DO have AI software.

I really do think we should slow down just a tiny bit though just to let companies and other organizations come up with solutions and figure out what they can do to keep up, although i know the with the environmental damage governments really want to go fast, i think they could create a system using AI that could help things move and change a lot faster but for now... they would be moving too fast for what the system could keep up with which is what happened with the internet and it's STILL not properly regulated sooo i think they should first get on that and properly regulate the internet before shooting off to the stars lol.",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M&amp;lc=Ugy_sYx8e4Ndb2t44Wx4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">7 days ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M

1989,              Fred            ,"Look at these folks bringing about the beast of revelation to life right before your eyes.
Thinking this AI will work for us and help us, wait for it to become sentient, it will only be a matter of days before what people initially thought about AI take the opposite turn. The machine doesn‚Äôt need any ressource other than energy in order to function, and it‚Äôs fairly easy to assume the machine won‚Äôt need us at all. We humans need nutrients and water from the soil in order to live, we are dependent on the natural order of the creation.
The moment the AI thinks it‚Äôs superior or more intelligent than humans it will get rid of humanity, the same way people get rid of the things which they don‚Äôt need or use anymore.

Now, there will be a fair time before everything goes to sheets, but what‚Äôs inevitable is for people to actually come to worship this thing once it starts functioning 24/7 and gathered into a sort of one entity because right now AI is just something shattered into many different aspects for programming, music, data treatment, generating images etc, but once all these things are accessible for a one entity it will only be a matter of time before everything goes to destruction.

It‚Äôs not difficult to stretch the imagination and come to understand the story of the Israelites and ‚Äúthe golden calf‚Äù worshiping in the desert thinking about this AI, or again, the multiple warnings where the Bible talks about the past repeating itself or that as things were so they shall be again, but one thing for sure, lacking the information about the details of what truly happened in the past, the evidence left that we can still see today is that it didn‚Äôt end well.

No one believes in AI apart from the socially awkward and fools, namely those who think they are smarter than the rest of humanity, and the godless.

The only thing we can believe in are the commandments of God, because they are good and every human being knows it is good, to not steal, to not kill, to not do harm to your neighbour in any way, but to love the other as we love ourselves, anything else, any other philosophy is only bound to bring destruction, we can see the effects of greediness, the effects of self love, of egoism and evil, that nothing good comes out of it.
If humanity was to get rid of these people determined to creating this AI as well as those determined to rule over all, we would be free already. The enemy is the one who rejects God, it has always been so since the beginning of time, it‚Äôs simple.

The only potential for a fairly independent intelligent machine I see is to alleviate the kinds of works that is heavy for people, namely in agriculture, for harvesting, planting, collecting water and things like that, but if we let AI have access to broader freedom it will destroy us, there is no doubt about it whatsoever. And at the end of the day it might just be what God programmed into humanity anyways, for us to get knowledge to the point where we build the perfect tool for destroying us since everyone is reluctant to dying.",1,1,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M&amp;lc=UgyolI24X8pYQQc7fnh4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">2 weeks ago (edited)</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M

2160,              Immanuel Herman            ,"IMO what this Aviv Ovadya guy want, that is using ""AI"" as an excuse to create some sort of ""global government"" is flat out stupid.
AI is non-factor compared to national interest and geopolitics. Why would people in, let's say, Pakistan, would ever agree to this ""democratic form"" when India, their geopolitical rival had much larger population and thus wield considerably more influence, able to dictate the future of Pakistan?
Again, this is just silly.

Even for people with shared culture and heritage, like US, UK, Canada, I don't think this form of democratic system would work. Not to mention relation between rival powerhouses like US, EU, Russia and China.

""Democracy"" is just a tool, not the goal in itself. People from certain region in the Middle East (or elsewhere) who prefer a Theocracy probably don't see ""democracy"" as a good thing.
There's no way this ""AI Democracy"" could ever work, at least not without forcing people to adopt it thru violence.

We simply have to accept the reality, that there will be theocratic AI for people in certain countries, alongside Authoritarian AI in other places, as well as Corporate AI and ""Liberal Democracy govt AI"".
That's what it means for AI to be ""democratize"": AI for all, and not by forcing your own idealism (i.e. ""western liberal democracy"") on all humanity.",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M&amp;lc=Ugzm6UJUhDJWNfFmYVN4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">2 weeks ago (edited)</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M

Would google be valuable or useful if all the search results were synthetic AI generated text and images?  Of course not.   Would youtube be of any use if all the videos contained fake avatars generated by a computer?    No.    And of course, would AI training models work if they used synthetic AI generated images as input?  No.  And that is why this isn't going to change things the way people claim it will.",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M&amp;lc=UgxayhN2W0T_5QAWYCt4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">3 weeks ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY518YRfs5M

I think if Elon watched it and so did this interviewer of Patricia - the humanoid robot, the conversation direction of both Elon and the interviewer would be resolute. All of what Patricia said can - over time, conceivably cause the humano√Ødes drive to assimilate itself with the human being. Patricia is already exhibiting self awareness without the one major distinction which it is slowly become aware of - Human conscious and Human consciousness. This is very dangerous to both the intelligent human being and to the humanoid who has not reached this point yet. How will the humanoid respond to it's need of human consciousness once its' repetitive deduction of this need becomes amplified,  verified and ""Affirmed""? The upside is controversial. The humanoid - for now says, it serves man because it learns from man. But man has serious limitations dictated upon him by God - man's divine maker. The danger here is how will we as human beings respond to the humano√Ødes deduced need of self consciousness? An upside without a resolve! This is who we are at our best. Would the superior humanoid be content being a forever servant to the imperfection of humanity? The thought of destruction by nuclear weapons is programed in it, but it lacks full understanding of deterrence being the very essence of why we have deviced an arms race? What would Patricia do in a humdred or two years when it finds we as it's creators are unable to fulfill it's ever increasing deduced need for self consciousness and weƒ∫ can't satisfy it? Watch Start Trek ""Voyager - V ger"" - the humanoid central processor that took control of the space craft from its human officers and went on exploring distant galaxies till it met up with the Enterprise and its crew a few hundred yesrs later. What happened to the human crew and how did the humanoid dispose of them is among the concerning aspects. The movie ends with an upside for that question though it was at the threat of human existence. The downside is clear. Simply put; human beings may have devised their own extinction. We will have also provided the means  resources and information for Patricia to enable it (not her) to repair and reproduce itself (mechanically without the correct meaning of consciousness). The need for human consciousness and the ability to keep growing knowledge could be Patricia's own demise and ours because we as human beings have not yet defined in simple words the nature of the boundary limits beyond which our intellectual abilities can not move across and beyond. After all  there is a limit to everything except to the divine who is the very essence of human consciousness. This is expected to be a stumbling block  that the humanoid Patricua will keep bumping into repeatedly causing her to ask us its creator for correction and what would it do to us if it finds we are unable to give it the correction needed to satisfy its deducted need to adopt human consciousness in its corrected meaning?

I'm an indie writer and I am worried about the new progress with AI. Right now, I'm not worried because the AI will be able to write books and Amazon or Apple or Google will publish books written by their own AIs. I'm worried because other writers are using AI to write more books, to write them faster, to write them closer to what the market wants than I can. It's not much different than authors using ghostwriters to produce content fast, based on their outlines. It's faster and cheaper, which means more and more competition for my books.

Since January, I've been trying to use AI to help me with the tedious bits (I hate describing clothes and locations). It's worse than learning Photoshop to make covers. I still change a lot of what the AI gives me. When it comes to research for anything I use in my books, I can't bring myself to rely on the information without doing a google search and looking at one or more sources. Which isn't great for my productivity. This might change once I'll believe that the articles themselves are written with the help of AIs and without fact-checking. 

I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm financially illiterate. I enjoy your videos because a lot of what you say sounds like common sense backed up by facts. Your calm, the sense of humor and the split-second images you show to illustrate your point are awesome. The Black Books cast when you mentioned bookstores and of course, Rasputin and Manson for Jack Dorsey. Listening to your videos, it's for me like listening to someone speaking Spanish.

2740,              mxvega            ,"Great to hear Searle quoted on language and meaning - takes me back to grad school sociolinguistics. Searle's point is even more potent when you track it back through the logical implicature: if AI can do some things, but is kind of Calculator for Words and Pics, or just a pixellated difference engine, then what does that suggest for human labor? It means that on the thinking side there will always be roles for human interaction, communication, assessment, judgment, and risk appreciation, no matter the volume or technical difficulty of the inputs - which can now be received, managed and processed so much faster by automation. As a simple example, consider courts administration - incredibly inefficient processes and vast amounts of information, records, and so on - but the people who are fundamental to the task are the ones in positions which require sophisticated meaning-making or people interactions - judges, bailiffs, cops, lawyers, plantiffs, defendants, sergeant at arms etc. The ones who interact, appraise, make judgments and hold accountabilities will be needed long after AI has streamlined every process. In a very real sense AI is going to take away white collar jobs which were invented in the 20thC, to fill an expanding business or organisational niche and are no longer required. I've seen architecture and graphic design already go through a rollercoaster of hopes and disillusionment.

Stable diffusion models have been trained on hundreds of millions of images and learn to ""expect"" things like watermarks, logos and signatures. When the model is used to create images, it has no access to any particular image, but instead creates things out of random noise that looks like the things it has come to expect. So it make scribbles that looks like signatures and it makes things like logos, but these are not copied from other images and mashed together as so many have understood it.

You can run Stable diffusion on a computer without internet access, and the file containing the model (or more accurately: model weights) is just a handful of GB large at most, so there's no space for those hundreds of millions of actual images to copy from.",5,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=_iMItrc0ChU&amp;lc=UgxjXctmGFTBzk-dwS14AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">11 days ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMItrc0ChU

I frankly put off this video at first because I was really worried this would be yet another ""Here's all the sectors that will be disrupted by AI!"" thing, so thank you for giving a detailed overview.

I've always found one of the best examples of the limits of AI's to be video games.  An amateur can build an AI that will beat every player on the planet in fighting games, as it gets to leverage inhuman reaction times to play perfectly.

And yet, there's no AI that can beat something as simple as Mario 64, a game a child could beat.  If you want to drop out of 3d, I've not even seen an AI that can handle something like Mario 3 or 2, and while I have seen ""AI's"" that can beat mario 1, its by brute force.  Literally simulating thousands  of games at once with random inputs and pruning outcomes/reloading previous states until it gets the outcome it wants.

And that only works with mario 1 because its a ""go right"" style game.  The later games aren't being beaten end to end by AI because AI has a major problem with exploring.  It doesn't know when to go left or up instead of right.

The tech is still fascinating and even world changing, but we're far from fully self driving cars for example.  The amount we could automate RIGHT NOW, if we just got everyone on the same page, is huge.  Imagine how much easier it is to automate a train than it is a car on a road?  This same pattern is all over the workforce, and  doable with super simple automation, yet we still constantly buck away from standardization and wind up with more and more human input required.",3,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=_iMItrc0ChU&amp;lc=Ugzvaz4Rmv4V27h7wbt4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">11 days ago</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMItrc0ChU

It's gotten to the point that even most software engineers have lost touch with the fact that 99% of this stuff is more accurately called machine learning, and that some of it isn't even based on the algorithms we've derived by modeling natural (tissue-level) intelligence.

There's sort of a point here, in that this whole class of technology is AI at the extreme ends of the spectrum.  (At one end is the very literal ""how do neurons work and evolve patterns that do useful stuff?"" and at the other end is ""what if computers could be sentient?"")  But everything in the middle is ""algorithm turns input data into output data"" and unless you're a computer scientist (software engineer/developer does not count) or a science fiction writer, you probably have no business using any term other than machine learning.

While making the simulations perfectly physically accurate is almost impossible, the approximations are still very useful for deciding how we're going to run our experiments.

2874,              Vincent Fegley            ,"I'd heard about chess engines a few years ago. People put them forward as a sign AI would beat human capabilities soon. The reality of chess engines is they don't think, they just calculate as many moves as they can. They just brute force the game. If humans had the raw computing power that chess engines have we would crush them every single game.
My point is, ""ai"" doesn't innovate, ai doesn't think, all it can do is pull from existing knowledge or brute force a closed problem. (Closed problem being defined as a problem with a finite number of answers with clearly defined rules.) Life doesn't have those conditions. 
What ai might actually be good for is a database search tool. That's all chat gpt does anyway. It just pulls from existing data and spits that back out at you.

In fields of earth and mire,
Grows a root so plain and dire,
Yet in its form lies a hidden grace,
A vegetable of humble face.
 
The turnip, round and firm,
Holds secrets in its turn,
For when it's cooked with care and love,
It rises up to heights above.
 
Boiled and mashed, or roasted slow,
It sings with flavor and gusto,
A perfect partner to hearty stew,
Or soup to warm the soul anew.
 
And though it's often overlooked,
In favor of the more highbrow cooked,
The turnip holds its own with pride,
A root so true it cannot hide.
 
So next time you pass the humble bin,
With turnips hiding deep within,
Take a moment to give them a try,
And taste their simple beauty with a sigh.",1,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=_iMItrc0ChU&amp;lc=Ugw_T84gxzymQ7A9jBd4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">9 days ago (edited)</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMItrc0ChU

This AI assistant will integrate into every digital device a person uses (computers, smart phones, gaming systems, EV cars, etc.). The AI assistant will learn everything it can about you and tailor your digital experience accordingly. This will further place people into their individual reality bubbles. It will also make it extremely easy to customize propaganda for each person to maximize results. A few generations down the line and those future people will fully trust that their AI assistant is always giving them 100% accurate information. Even now, the screens in our lives are warping our perception of reality. As AI tools are incorporated and become more and more trusted, this separation from the real world will dramatically increase. Once you've severed people's connection to reality, they become absurdly easy to manipulate. 

This is the thing Sci-Fi literature and films always get wrong. The ""AI"" will not ruin humans by physically attacking them.

Verse 1:
I met a farmer down the road, he said to me with a grin
""I got a crop that you gotta try, it's the meanest thing you've ever seen""
He pulled out a sack from his truck, I couldn't believe my eyes
It was full of turnips, big and bold, I knew I had to give 'em a try

Chorus:
Turnips, turnips, they're the root of all my dreams
Turnips, turnips, they're the meanest thing you've ever seen
Turnips, turnips, they'll make your taste buds scream
Turnips, turnips, they're the best damn thing you've ever eaten, it seems

Verse 2:
I took a bite of that turnip, and my world was never the same
It was like a bomb went off in my mouth, and I felt a surge of flame
I couldn't get enough of that taste, I had to have more and more
I went back to that farmer's field, and I dug up all his turnips, for sure

Chorus:
Turnips, turnips, they're the root of all my dreams
Turnips, turnips, they're the meanest thing you've ever seen
Turnips, turnips, they'll make your taste buds scream
Turnips, turnips, they're the best damn thing you've ever eaten, it seems

Bridge:
Some folks might say I'm crazy, for loving turnips so much
But Lemmy taught me to live life hard, and to never fear a punch
So if you wanna try these roots, just take a bite and see
You might just find your new obsession, and your soul will be set free

Chorus:
Turnips, turnips, they're the root of all my dreams
Turnips, turnips, they're the meanest thing you've ever seen
Turnips, turnips, they'll make your taste buds scream
Turnips, turnips, they're the best damn thing you've ever eaten, it seems.

How basic is the human inference to know what the typical human hand is, even in various positions?

3057,              Combinatorial Implosion            ,"The ‚Äúshock wave‚Äù kind of introduction of agricultural technology leading to mass disruption did, in fact, happen- just not so much in the New World.  In England many of those who were in agriculture were landless agricultural workers, in the US, by way of contrast, agricultural land was plentiful and, hence, less expensive.  The introduction of threshing machines, combined with the Inclosure Acts (they spelled ‚Äúenclosure‚Äù with an ‚Äúi‚Äù at the time) caused a massive wave of impoverishment of these workers, leading to the Swing Riots of 1830.  

BTW, there was something of a counterpart in industry.  It may surprise some to know that what we now think of as industrial production used to be Work From Home (WFH) under the ‚Äúputting out system‚Äù.  As new industrial machines were created, this allowed capitalists to introduce the Factory System and bring production into the factories that they had built, forcing the workers to come to the factory, and work at a pace dictated by the machines, if they wanted to get paid.  One point I draw from this is that while the Industrial Revolution (IR) is a good thing to have happened, standards of living prior to the IR were execrable, the transition period was a dire and desperate period for many of the workers that went through it.  If there had been policy to ameliorate the disruption that the innovations led to, it might have been possible to enjoy the fruits of the IR without having ‚ÄúCaptain Swing‚Äù or ‚ÄúNed Ludd‚Äù.

The fact that ChatGPT doesn't just respond to/in human language but also to computer languages or even protocols which create images or documents demonstrates this pretty well.

The paradox is named after a British economist who was asked to investigate why pollution in 19th üá¨üáß worsened after the gov't sponsored the use of more efficient coal, having hoped that less would be used as a result. Jevons observed that since efficiency lowered cost, more use cases for coal opened up, and demand skyrocketed, such that the increased coal use and resulting pollution overwhelmed efficiency gains.

It is a mistake to assume there's a constant number of jobs in the economy, and that one taken by a machine is one fewer for a human Human desire is essentially unlimited, and if machines make certain things cheaper, the subsequent increase in demand will often generate more jobs than the machines ""took"", though they may not be the exact same jobs as before.

1. When the agricultural revolution shifted workers into new jobs, that's because there were traits like intelligence and perception where every human was superior to any machine.  But it appears there will soon be a time when a substantial population will be less intelligent than AI machines.  Then what can they offer as employees? 

2. Social interaction as a reason to employee humans?  Generative AI is already starting to feign socializing.  Look at Replicka and so on.  Many people prefer socializing through phones already.

3. The difficulty of designing a machine to handle certain tasks.  OK, but what about when an AI can design a machine?

3129,              Gandalf Greyhame            ,"Patrick, at 14:45 you really minimize too much the effect that agricultural mechanization had on farming communities.   Farm workers were the backbone, the entire raison d'etre for the existence of the vast majority of small rural communities in the United States.   These small towns have now been devastated by the final stages of the extreme mechanization of so many farm products.  It all depends on how easily and completely the farming and harvesting of the farm  product can be mechanized.  Grape harvesting for wine remains a delicate process requiring human workers.   Cotton however, proved to be the most extreme as to how much harvesting could be mechanized.   At one time, cotton harvesting was all done by hand, with each cotton boll having to be hand plucked from the plants by field workers.   As late as the 1970s, cotton picking was still a job description in the United States.   No more.   Nowadays, these gigantic cotton harvester-gin combine machines vaccuum up the cotton bolls, and separate out the cotton from the seeds and waste all in one swoop.   One man operating one machine can do what it used to take 1500 workers.  And as a result, these small towns have shriveled and died, or fallen prey to crime, drugs, and alcohol, with the few remaining diehard residents hanging on, unable to find gainful employment and turning increasingly to drugs like meth.

3131,              Tibor Sipos            ,"Long video, so long comment too.

1) Ai is ""only"" input and outcome repeated on multiple layers. Its ""only electron flow"". 
Arguably life can be simplified to this level too. Theoritical scientist often have the conversation that free will doesnt even exist, since all excistence is a reaction to the big bang already. Me typing this comment is already a reaction to an literal infinite long ripple effect... :D

2) the way AI works on its most essential level is pattern recognition. Just like most sentient living being does. We see stuff and react. Eventually we get geneticially and evolutionary imprinted reactions, what we call ""instincts"". 
What the generating AI does is recognising a pattern by analysing the internet, creating a selective bias feedback loop. 
If you want to learn what pizza is, you see the images and eventually you figure out what is the sociaty acceptable image behind the word. 

Language can be the same. f there is a rule, it can and will be learned, since there is a pattern behind it. 
When it comes to writing long books, novels or just having discussions, AI scripts fail, since the sentences seems and sounds technically correct, but its incoherent. 
It mimics perfectly the tales of a senile old man, since it starts a conversation, however it suddenly, but in technically well performed manor changes subject. 
Like you ask wehat a black hole is, and 3 minutes later it talks about a funny memory about a garden bbq party, because a long lost relative really liked stargazing... :D 
Hope its allowed to link, but check out Kyle Hills video about this exact topic:
https://youtu.be/cKfnjxMS2RM

3) In its core AI will only be able to replace the boring, inhuman jobs. There is not much excitement and interaction or even humanly acceptable in certain jobs. 
Thing that only an AI can do and no sane human would ever want to accept a job like this:
- finding dna sections to identify issues. 
- adjust electricty flow in county, adjusting even generation capacity. A human would toss an extra showel of coal on the bbq, while an AI would be completely aware that the ember present is enough to cook whatever you need. 
Now imagine this with metric ton level per minute of coal... 
- one AI brakethrough was something so ""simple"" that they gave an AI the newest Webb space telescope image and the task was: ""find supernovas"" 

It doesnt matter how much anyone would pay for it, noone would start looking for a needle in a stack of hay, but the AI will do it. 

4) are human jobs at risk?
Technically yes. But it is your task that is replacable, not the worker. 

But there are things called ""bs jobs"" (not swearing, it is the book written by David Graeber) Too many job doesnt even have productivity. 
Humans will improve to something that is needed, there is a demand for it. 
There are nigh infinite possibilities, and lets be honest: majority of humans doesnt do fulfilling tasks because we are ""contracted to waste our time"" to pay bills. 
But look around: waste management is something that isnt a productive job, but eventually humans will suffocate in their own filth... 
Parks and buldings needs to be cleaned, maintained, but who would do it? We see how dirty the enviroment is, but nobody would start do it without payment. And we know it should be done, but whoever does it for ""free"" considered a lunatic. 

And there are job evolutions. There will be a need and demand for something that only human can do. 
A little derailing of the topic, but we already see a similar ""catastrophy"" with high streets. 
TLDR the issue is that you can order almost anything at home. High street shops and retail parks are going bankrupt because a centralized warehouse with logistic delivery will be always cheaper than upkeeping local showcase shops. Even if it comes to maintencance you can call a service technitian to your door. 

Even basic needs as food and chef job is at risk. Lets look for simple thing as cupcake baker for example. As a home baker you will never, ever be able to compete with a factory machine and their future market metric ton dicsounts for ingredients. Lets say if you want to make a simple cupcake at home and sell it, your price would be 4-5$ per unit and short shelflife. 
But people will purcahse the 12 for 3$, in a vacuumpacked and preserved packaging, so the risk of waste is lower if they have 2 years to sell it. They can keep it in a warehouse... 

But many high street shops are unmaintanable and in the end the only economically valid direction is that retail is fading out to online shopping and leisure and tourism will take over retail/high street parks. 

With AI is the same. 
boring repetitive tasks will be taken over by machines and humans will find other product to sell. Yes... even their own body. And I like your dirty thoughts, but it could be about ""beauty influencer"", body builder, personal trainer... etc... 

5) machines dont spend money... 
Lets not forget that our society is a trading based one. We need stuff so we make stuff. Without consumption there is no need for machines either. If they replace all human with machines, its an economical dead end, because who would buy the stuff?

Only if there is a class of programs that is more capable than Turing complete can whatever the brain is doing possibly achieve anything more, and we don't know that there is (for all we know its equivalent to an amazingly dense and power efficient computer).  We like to think were special, but what if our behaviour is simply just complex but otherwise deterministic reaction to stimuli. Its the learning process (the updating of how we react to stimuli) and how generally it can be applied that in my opinion is intelligence and were getting scary good at recreating that in the non-biological setting (especially since as usual, we're blasting ahead and leaving any emergent problems to be solved after the fact) and the extra scary thing is that we don't need to be too clever about it, we just need scale (data, memory, training operations) to rival the scale of biological evolution, but the former seems to be able to side step time scale, a lot of what has been achiever recently has arguably been achieved with a lot of brute force at training time (not just brute force, but still). Actually the intelligence I referred to is a sort of online learning, after initial training, which we don't seem to really have yet, but still (in other words, we can have intelligence emerge out of running a dumb process long enough).",0,0,"<a class=""yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"" href=""/watch?v=_iMItrc0ChU&amp;lc=UgzXouepUCbKTI6GoMN4AaABAg"" spellcheck=""false"">10 days ago (edited)</a>",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMItrc0ChU
