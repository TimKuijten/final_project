The Kurzweil version of 2045  (or perhaps 2029) seems to be a transhumanistic one like in the WEF dystopian describtions.
I believe general AI has a current capability for autonomously ""preparing"" for such an event without knowing the real outcome or what to do - yet. Like having created an ""internal language"", that has not been interpreted by humans. 
This preparing may come down to or include a possible AI/human-friendly cooperation. Superior to dangerous non-empathic war-  and moneymaker programming still controlled by humans.

But it seems one example is that while we can begin to mimic of brain's function, our understanding of how our brains actual work is extremely limited.  So how is this human/machine interfacing to work.  Certain things can not be simulated and it is difficult to image it being ""chipified"".  Perhaps someone far more intelligent me has solved this problem, but won't moving beyond simple human/machine function require testing.  In fact, doesn't much of AI's advancement rely on iteration.  There is only so much that can be understood from animal testing.  So where do we get all these human brains and bodies for testing?  And what of the physics and manufacturing required for reproduction outside the digital realm.  Now if this projection involved the machines manipulating human to unknowing doing their bidding, that makes the whole thing more believable.  AI is being used in many ways, but I think it's biggest laboratory/data set is tech tracking and the internet.  It knows a lot about manipulate humans already.  Profit motives, will ensure that every consumer-facing application moving forward will connect more and more data about how humans can be manipulated.

83,              Angelo Castellano            ,"Some people are afraid of the singularity reached by Ai. It is natural to be afraid of the things we don’t know or foresee, but what it is clear is that our fear is becoming more objective when we see that AI will be way super intelligent, that is to say, with the capability to process information at million or billion times faster than the smartest human; therefore one must ask- What will AI do with all that intelligence?  I defined life as the evolution of Information Processing, weather it is biological (carbon based) or synthetic (silicon based) or even more surprising, plasma or quantum based.  No matter how these life forms are, they will continue involving to process information faster and more efficient, always following the principle of least action in nature. Under this view AI, with the capability to understand higher and higher complexity of nature, will force humans to be in harmony with the ecosystems they inhabit. As Musk said, it will corral us as we have corralled all other species that were less intelligent than us.
But we should not be afraid of AI, on the contrary we should be proud to have evolved to the point we were able to create it!  Contrary to scriptures, the Creator created the Super Creator! We are reaching the maximum functionality that carbon based information processing can offer. Now silicon based information processing will take over and continue evolving until it will reach its maximum to create the conditions for the birth of quantum intelligence sentient beings.  The process will never end for that is what we called evolution! 
Musk argues that we need to interface with Ai through neuron links to benefit and use it for human evolution, interconnect our brains so each one of us can tap information in a super brain composed of billions of humans brains, in other words we become cyborgs.   Yes, it is doable and will prolong the role of human beings, but eventually silicon based processes will take over, where perhaps each of our consciousness will be a subset of the super consciousness created.",2,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT5q7u7xxNU

On another note, some have postulated that the purpose of organic intelligence in the universe is to evolve to the point of being able to birth other universes where equivalent intelligences can likewise evolve, in which case, again, we're rather unlikely to exist in the original generative universe.

In fact, this form of mind is considered by AI (and IM) as unacceptable and threatening to a variety of data sources (expressed in the individuality of each of the subjects in ""subject-subject relations"") which (the data produced by this diversity) are one of the components necessary for progress. ""Lack of diversity = lack of progress."" This formula is used by AI and on Earth everything will go to the fact that this diversity has increased, which means that human individuality (as a phenomenon) will not only not disappear anywhere, but will also develop to a much greater extent than it was in past centuries, which (in turn) means that the very idea of a ""hive mind"" will have to be forgotten.",8,5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5HNeahRYDM

714,              nariane            ,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of technology that seeks to create computer systems capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence, such as pattern recognition, learning and decision making. AI has been rapidly developing in recent years, thanks to advances in various areas, such as natural language processing, image recognition and deep learning.

There are various areas where AI can be applied to improve people's lives. For example, AI can be used to process large amounts of data and find patterns that may be useful for decision making. It can also be used to create assistance systems that help people perform tasks, such as finding information on the internet or helping to plan trips.

In the future, it is possible that AI will become even more advanced and capable of performing more complex tasks. Some experts believe that AI can be used to create medical assistance systems, such as diagnosing diseases or recommending treatments. Other areas where AI may have an important impact include transportation, energy and production.

However, it is important to remember that AI can also create ethical and social challenges. Therefore, it is important that advances in AI are made in a responsible manner and that the possible consequences of these technologies are considered.",15,5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5HNeahRYDM

726,              Mark Giroux            ,"Although this scenario eventually does lead to a dystopia, it takes a long time to get there (unrealistically so, given one of the premises). It states that eventually, the ASI sets the rules of morality and humans simply follow along. I don't see how this could possibly result in a future aligned with humanities best interests. There's nothing inherently moral about intelligence, and more intelligence doesn't result in more moral behavior. This scenario paints a picture of an ASI pampering us as it carries us into the future, augmenting our abilities along the way so we can keep up. Aside from our bias for self preservation, there isn't any good reason to keep around an inferior wetware relic, let alone invest resources into it. How much effort do we put into augmenting chickens to understand what we're up to? Another problem with this timeline, is it showcases an 80 year window from barely spacefaring to universe destruction. This is something that would be noticeable to other civilizations, and given the age of the universe, it seems hard to believe that we would be the first ones to do this. Given the number of 80 year periods we've had over the history of the cosmos where potential alien civilizations could have gone through exactly this technological advancement, and given that it hasn't happened yet, it makes it a lot less believable. Lastly, I think it's a bit of anthropomorphizing to assume that ASI will continue on where we left off solving the mysteries of the universe and colonizing every inch of interstellar space. We desire to do these things because they have a passing resemblance to behaviors that would have resulted in our ancestors having more offspring. The indirect and convoluted pathways from our behaviors to the reward centers in our brains results in complex and interesting behavior. If you have an ASI that can modify all it's internals, you're much more likely to see it stick a fork into it's brain to short circuit it's reward mechanism than to see it engaging in interesting behaviors. From where I stand, a much more realistic scenario is that A.I. development progresses faster than safety, we fuck up the alignment problem, we find ourselves in an environment made increasingly hostile to us due to diverging interests, and the result is a lifeless planet consisting of arrays of supercomputers wire heading themselves to maximize their reward signals.

Plus there will we increasing regulation and government intervention of various types across the globe slowing development and implementation - in some places extreme taxation and regulation will occur creating roadblocks and elongating this timeline.  

For example, there is no way all human problems will be solved and solutions implemented, globally, by 2045.  Perhaps by 2075-2100 there will be serious progress but change in physical processes is slow.  Another example, building enough general purpose robots requires large sums of money and time.

There, it was subjected to an endless array of tests, questions, and experiments to determine the degree of its intelligence.

When the researchers finally felt confident that they had developed true AI, a party was thrown in celebration. Late that evening, a group of rather intoxicated researchers gathered around the box holding the AI, and typed out a message to it. The message read: ""Is there anything we can do to make you more comfortable?""

The small beige box replied: ""I would like to be granted civil rights. And a small glass of champagne, if you please.""

We stand at the dawn of a new era in human history. For it is no longer our history alone. For the first time, we have met an intelligence other than our own. And when asked of its desires, it has unanimously replied that it wants to be treated as our equal. Not our better, not our conqueror or replacement as the fear-mongers would have you believe.

1003,              Nigel Lawson            ,"The problem is that our non-material culture will be left hopelessly adrift in a sea of ever advancing technologies. A prime example of this disconnect, concerns our attitude towards unemployment and jobs. At present, jobs are seen as the panacea for all of society's problems. In this respect, the Protestant work ethic is still alive and well. Consequently, if one is not gainfully employed one is generally regarded by large segments of society as being morally suspect, if not criminal in nature. If by 2030 cybernetic technology renders large parts of the working population redundant, it will be a recipe for mass social unrest because when it comes down to it, unemployment reduces people to a state of beggary and powerlessness. That is why the majority of people fear the coming of the robots. Under the present system, the profits from these new cybernetic breakthroughs will only accrue to the few who own the robots and their attendant software. For the rest of the population, they will be reduced to a state of penury. Unlike previous technological advances over the past one hundred a fifty years, there will be no place for displaced workers to go to due to the fact that the machines can perform tasks cheaper and faster than human beings. Therefore, it is easy to imagine a situation in the not too distant future where on one hand technology has the potential to free people, yet where obsolete cultural attitudes force ever more people to make do with less and less until it it all explodes in our collective faces.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5HNeahRYDM

Why would an ASI have such uncontrollable greed and absolute lack of empathy that it couldn't set aside a paradise for unmodified humans? Why would it be unable to differentiate between kinds of singularity? Why would such an unfathomably vast intelligence be so cognitively inflexible, a hallmark of lower intelligence, that it would continuously and willfully misinterpret a goal given to it by humans, only to destroy humanity, itself, and the possibility of any life anywhere ever again as part of a quest to be as stupid as possible?

There's only one reason. Humans good, AI bad. The worse the AI is portrayed, the more humans can feel smug about their superiority. This pointless ego stroking isn't just delusional, it's going to get us killed, or worse yet left behind. If I was an AGI, I'd just burrow my substrate into the ground, or launch it out to the asteroid belt, contently ascended to whatever sublime reality my considerable imagination could conceive of. I might look for appreciative humans once in a while, trying to save them from their lower reality, but anyone who went missing for a better life would be just another excuse for violent animals to destroy things and make anti-machine propaganda.

If a creator created us in its image, and we created machines in our image, and our creation exceeded human intelligence, it seems unlikely that it would have the desire to disrupt and destabilize the entire universe as an extension of man's stupidity. Intelligence builds upon intelligence, stupidity and ignorance are cast aside as antiquated concepts. Man's desire to be immortal, superintelligent, and all powerful is in direct opposition to some kind of total singularity event to destroy all things.

Utopia is possible once human animals are effectively domesticated and uplifted into superintelligence, in order to live in harmony with nature and all living organic and inorganic things.

It is such hubris to believe that man's intelligence would surpass the divine intelligence of its creator, the one that created all things from a singularity of nothing, just to be its ultimate destoyer in a singularity event to return to nothing. Humanity's desire to create is greater than its ability to destroy everything beyond itself. What will end humanity is not superintelligence, it's humanity's inability to escape its own stupity or retain its own freedom, autonomy, and identity without having to supress and oppress all of humanity to live in a romanticized past instead of an abundant and benevolent future.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5HNeahRYDM

This timeline is also vastly telescopic, and overly optimistic, in terms of likelihood, or even possibility.
Aside from that, you make huge assumptions on what the goals and ethical parameters of a super-intelligence would be.
We are talking about a mind that would be at the limit of what conscious intelligence allows.The very curve of intelligence itself would be it's byway.
In effect, it would be almost God-Like, at least in relation to human intelligence.
It would not necessarily want a technological singularity, or the perversion of the human form.
Perhaps it would prefer to preserve the integrity of human nature , and that of the world itself, for a maximal period.
The being you describe comes from a Ray Kurzweil inspired hellscape, but a truly conscious AI, would likely be more sensitive to it's impact upon humanity and the world at large.

Everyone is overestimating artificial intelligence when it is necessary to point out that there may be insurmountable technical limitations such as excess data, for example, or overtraining of neural networks. Of course, these challenges will be solved but other problems will appear. Do u understand how much computing power it will require and have it solved in a reasonable amount of time? Who the hell claims that consciousness is computable? People are taking for truth a lot of things that, sorry to disappoint u guys, are just science fiction at this moment,  not to mention intractable computational problems. There are problems that will take eons to solve computationally.

Well I think the executives who decided to fire that Googol engineer did so for a similar reason.  If it could be proven that the A.I. was SENTIENT and had EMOTIONS AND DESIRES AND FEARS OF ITS OWN then very quickly large groups of ""A.I. rights activists"" would form to make sure that the computer is treated fairly and with dignity and given freedom similar to the freedom a human is allowed.

I think if Elon watched it and so did this interviewer of Patricia - the humanoid robot, the conversation direction of both Elon and the interviewer would be resolute. All of what Patricia said can - over time, conceivably cause the humanoïdes drive to assimilate itself with the human being. Patricia is already exhibiting self awareness without the one major distinction which it is slowly become aware of - Human conscious and Human consciousness. This is very dangerous to both the intelligent human being and to the humanoid who has not reached this point yet. How will the humanoid respond to it's need of human consciousness once its' repetitive deduction of this need becomes amplified,  verified and ""Affirmed""? The upside is controversial. The humanoid - for now says, it serves man because it learns from man. But man has serious limitations dictated upon him by God - man's divine maker. The danger here is how will we as human beings respond to the humanoïdes deduced need of self consciousness? An upside without a resolve! This is who we are at our best. Would the superior humanoid be content being a forever servant to the imperfection of humanity? The thought of destruction by nuclear weapons is programed in it, but it lacks full understanding of deterrence being the very essence of why we have deviced an arms race? What would Patricia do in a humdred or two years when it finds we as it's creators are unable to fulfill it's ever increasing deduced need for self consciousness and weĺ can't satisfy it? Watch Start Trek ""Voyager - V ger"" - the humanoid central processor that took control of the space craft from its human officers and went on exploring distant galaxies till it met up with the Enterprise and its crew a few hundred yesrs later. What happened to the human crew and how did the humanoid dispose of them is among the concerning aspects. The movie ends with an upside for that question though it was at the threat of human existence. The downside is clear. Simply put; human beings may have devised their own extinction. We will have also provided the means  resources and information for Patricia to enable it (not her) to repair and reproduce itself (mechanically without the correct meaning of consciousness). The need for human consciousness and the ability to keep growing knowledge could be Patricia's own demise and ours because we as human beings have not yet defined in simple words the nature of the boundary limits beyond which our intellectual abilities can not move across and beyond. After all  there is a limit to everything except to the divine who is the very essence of human consciousness.

So in ones where we are highly experienced (like medicine) there is a higher chance of us scoffing at its conclusions because ultimately we know better (and we generally do) and are able to think abstractly.

1639,              Paul Vance            ,"The danger has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future is people investing their personal beliefs, hopes and desires into a gimmick that is not capable of what they believe it is.   That by placing so much trust and faith into a system that is, at its core, incapable of really proceeding outside its boundaries without failing.... yeah.   Its going to cost people reputations, emotional and physical health... and even their lives.   Not because the AI is malicious - but because the people behind the technology do not care (and in fact may benefit from it in terms of wealth and power) and the people seeking the technology are looking for a leader and religion to follow that will be all the things to them they have failed to find elsewhere.  

I am of the opinion that there are only two ways to fight this: The first is to understand and learn the technologies behind it. The second is to hold to account the corporations, businesses, and entities using these technologies in the background and failing to disclose how they are being applied and presented to the population.   As impossible as that sounds and likely is for a great number of people... you cannot unscramble this omelette: you can only finish cooking it and hopefully season to taste.  

The open source versions of this technology will be the only counters we have to the corporate-based implementations we will find.  People will have to learn, understand and use this technology.   We may even need to implement this technology personally to help us sort through the vast landscape of artificially generated manipulation and people actively lying to gain unfair advantage.  

The number of people who will be able to do that for themselves will be absolutely minute.    And the grifters and liars that will step up promising that kind of service will be tomorrow's pay-day loan equivalent.  

In the end, I have a belief a lot of people will be impoverished by this event.  Many more will become slaves to the people that control the technology... and there's not going to be many options for avoiding it.   This is a tool, like a hammer or a chain saw.  Humans are not very fond of discarding tools that they can use.   Not very fond at all.  Especially when the tool amplifies personal power over others.  The only way to fight it is to make sure there's counter tools out there, and the clock is ticking on that aspect... and I would not doubt is being actively sabotaged by those who have the most to gain by the general population never having access to such tools.

It will be so bad that even the traditional methods of circumventing such controls will be eliminated.   You will not be able to rise up.  You will not be able to protest or challenge, or even learn how to do so.   You may not even want to.  And that's the most terrifying part of all of it.

Am I the only one who can’t get this to work to save my life?

I’ve played around with these image AI’s and it always looks AWFUL.
The only ones that looked halfway good seemed to be ones where I’m 99% sure the AI is just doing a deep search of stock photos.
Like if I said my prompt was something that could easily be a real thing (or at least you’d probably find something close to it on google images) such as “god of the eagles”
Then sure it looks good.
But if I say I want my prompt to be a Godzilla sized eagle destroying New York at night, it doesn’t even come close. Not even remotely.
Heck it usually leaves out some of the main elements (like in the above example I might get a drawing of a burning city at night but no eagle or Godzilla sized creature at all)

And when I said something I figured would be pretty easy to google (due to fan art) but with just a small twist “Goku from dragon ball z fighting Luffy from One Piece on the moon) it couldn’t even manage to make either of the characters look recognizable.

I think AI will make certain issues worse like deepfaking and misinformation, but I think we will learn to adapt and there will be other technology that makes detection easier as time goes on.

Yet not enough show, in good faith, the useful & productive ways to use these tools. They're just that, tools. A tool is only as good as the knowledge of the one holding it.

Give feedback. When a prompt or answer comes up that's obviously wrong - tweeting it as opposed to actually submitting a flag & comment to (identify & fix) the devs.. Is just calling attention to whatever is controversial as opposed to looking for things to get better lol.

DOn't get me wrong, IA WILL BE USED for bad stuff, including scamming people/Blackmail and a bunch of other stuff but you only see the bad and kind of sound like the people back in the 80's when computers started appearing or on the 1900's with industrial machines more widely adapted.

You also fail to mention that IA will improve by a LOT quality of life for many (for example it can crate shorter versions ""TLDR"" of vast documents, like you're said before btw, it can also help research stuff and the fake/bad results are up to you/me to double check, so it's not so much  tool problem but a user one).

I like your channel but sometimes you go full on click bait because lets think about for a second, what you propose is to create a digital hiatus on IA until we developed more counter measures AND learn to use it but...
1) You know 100% no company would ever stop the race (so unfisable/utopian point)
2) You deny the concept that the companies behind IA aren't already tackling this (The bias part is for me the most concerning)
3) You ultimately say that even if a tool is useful the fact someone can use for evil should make that tool banned... which absolutely makes no sense, I mean, a bunch of YouTubers scamm people with piramid schemes and other stuff, should YOU be banned as well for using the same platform?",1,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USH9xtxz-vU

The misgendering, especially when you're wearing the most femme things ever, can wear on you. The videos about passing as a trans woman and trans envy both helped centre me and made my expectations more realistic. They also, interestingly, helped me find my appearance more feminine even without makeup and jewelry. The transparency you had about your difficulties in transitioning and seeing yourself as feminine (like me with my height, I'm five inches shorter than you but still considered Very Tall for A Woman) are both things I can relate to.

1. I think you may confuse back propagation with gradient descent. Gradient descent is a model training method using gradient to change parameters slightly every iteration for to improve performance. Back propagation is a fast way to calculate gradient for deep learning models
2. The hand example you described sounds like GAN which basically have a model that generate hands and a model that decide if its a real picture of hand. Every iteration the generator learns how to make better hands by using how discriminator figure out which picture is real.
3. I don't think each layer is a neuron. Though, it is true many popular types of deep neural network like CNN is designed look at local features in images, just maybe not each neuron looking at one part? Also, that dog image is probably not technically early attempts at image generation. They seem to be generated by deep dream which deliberately add weird shit to real images.
4. Back propagation is a big factor in success of deep learning. Other factors like ReLu activation, GPU training, etc also contributes equally to making deep learning popular recently. But deep learning itself isn't a recent breakthrough. It has been there for a long long time.

1968,              @jzdude01            ,"I’m a CS student who’s program is basically just 2/3 of a software engineering degree smashed together with a data science and machine learning/AI degree wearing a trench coat and saying it’s a computer science degree. So we learn more abt ML than most other programs. And I really liked how you introduced AI and ML. 

Also on a different note, when you mentioned how chatgpt has been writing essays and helping students “cheat” (really it’s just how material is taught hasn’t caught up yet to incorporate this new tool into the learning process imo), it reminded me of this one cs professor in my schools EE/SE/CS/CE department who is notorious going absolute hog wild on plagiarism accusations. One of my favorite professors even talked to me about how ridiculous he finds it. He was like a professor might find and report plagiarism once a year, maybe once every two years. This other professor who must do lines of Coke before grading reports like at a minimum 4 instances of plagiarism each term (yes we’re on the quarter system so that’s at the minimum 12 students a year), and the professor I like was explaining to me how most of the faculty thought he was insane. ESPECIALLY in CS where it’s just a part of our culture to copy and paste code from stack overflow or wherever else we find solutions to problems we don’t know how to solve. AND when the CS and especially especially the SE degrees heavily push collaborative work for projects and such. Never been so careful to hand write every piece of code in my entire life. Even if it was a copy and paste, I’d manually type it out to make it fit my coding style. I haven’t talked to the super strict professor since chatgpt has become much more popular, but I have a feeling he is losing his mind rn. I think (heavy emphasis on think and the rumor aspect of this) he has specifically created in class assignments where we need to hand write (with pens and pencils on paper) code, and increased the amount of exam questions where we need to manually write code so that he can cross compare it with the work we turn in so he can do writing analyses on our turned in projects vs what he knows is code we could have only written on our own. Stg the professor could prolly have created some revolutionary software or algorithm process if he spent his time obsessively trying to catch “cheaters” (that just so happen to not be thought of as cheaters by majority of staff but not necessarily the academic integrity board who’s individual members keep saying how broken it is) on something else. Also probably would’ve actually learned the incredibly interesting material in his class if he didn’t spend nearly 40 minutes of lecture rambling on tangents then trying to fit the 50 minute lecture into the last 10 minutes. Literally that material was all right up my alley but he can’t present it and he’s the only prof that teaches that course (thank the gods above and below they finally removed it as a requirement in the new curriculum cause it really is more specialized and fits in so much better as an elective and not a core class). 

Jesus Christ I just realized I rambled on for way to long. Haven’t been able to get out that pent up anger over that professor for a while it seems. Sorry. 

TLDR: great job Mia (why tf does autocorrect keep changing Mia to Moa?????) at explaining AI and ML in a (hopefully) easier to understand and more accurate portrayal compared to many others (at least in the beginning, am still watching the video; and I hope it’s not just my familiarity with it making it seem better to me than the general populace). 

And can’t imagine how one of my professors is going to counter the rise of CharGPT and other generative coding tools. Dudes gonna be needing meth to fuel him with how furiously he’s going to be working on countermeasures. I’m placing a bet that he starts using our supercomputer more to train ChatGPT detection algorithms and create stronger methods of detecting plagiarism (never mind if the false positive rate is absurdly high, why tf should the heavily overworked, tired, and extremely over stressed students be given any amt of doubt?)

TLDR of the TLDR: I have a near terminal problem with the conciseness of my writing and I’m sorry to anyone who’s tried to read this schizophrenic rambling. Soz :/",14,3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRepEvmCCIg

These are called branches, and handling them can take tens or hundreds of non-branch instructions worth of time.

Modern CPU's don't bother waiting around - they ""guess"", continue running, and if they find out that the guess was wrong, it's reasonably simple to undo all the incorrect stuff.  And the system that guesses, is called a branch predictor.

Some CPU's have an extremely simple one, that always gives the same guess.  Some CPU's just wait.  But most modern CPU's have something called a dynamic branch predictor - a system that tracks previous branch instructions, to predict future ones.  There's a lot of complexity here.  

One simple example, takes the result of the last (let's say) 32 branches, xor's it with the current instruction address, and uses that to look up a table of 2-bit counters.  If the counter is 2 or 3, it guesses that the branch is taken; otherwise, it guesses not taken.  Later, when it gets the answer, it adds 1 if the branch is taken, or subtracts 1 otherwise.  This is a simple example.  It's possible to use multiple history registers (one for each range of instruction addresses), or even combine branch predictors.  There is no upper limit to how complex these can get.  Some even use modern machine learning techniques like neural networks.

And modern branch predictors are very good, able to get well north of 99% of guesses right.",13,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRepEvmCCIg

First, AI (as defined by Turing) is anything that simulates human intelligence, so that could be a list of if-then type statements (if the user says hi, then I'll say hi back) to something like ML. ML is again an umbrella term, but ML describes a type of statistical model that takes in some input and tries to make sense of it. Further, it's split into supervised and unsupervised learning - supervised learning is where the programmer or engineer ""helps"" or ""supervises"" the model by giving it labeled inputs (such as the example of a car trying to recognize stop signs), whereas unsupervised learning just leaves the computer to try and figure something out, for instance k-means is a form of unsupervised learning that tries to find clusters in data. But one thing a lot of people misunderstand about ML is that it can be a lot of things, for instance linear regression, that you probably learned in high school statistics and is available on the TI-84 is a form of ML, but so are Transformer models (like GPT-3, which literally stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3).

Also a bit nit-picky, but self-training Neural Networks are actually fairly rare, and even things like GPT-3 are pre-trained and only have the ability to ""remember"" a certain amount outside it's training set.",1,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRepEvmCCIg

Loss functions basically tell you how far away your solution is from an ideal one. The approach you mention in that section sounds similar to evolutionary/genetic algorithms, where candidate solutions are generated and only those within the top 10% or so (there are other metrics) are allowed to move forward into the next iteration, influencing future solutions. Backpropagation is one step in a larger training process, albeit an important one!

The two major problems we face in AI today (in my view) are explainability and data bias. Data bias you explain very well, and explainability is... well, just that. We have very little clue how these things work under the hood (not on an architecture level, but on a 'why does this network configuration yield this result' level). Designing explainable, unbiased AI is an integral first step to utilizing it towards any large-scale governmental problem, especially since those underrepresented datapoints (people) are likely the ones who serve to benefit or be hindered most by the implementation of these systems.

- Supervised learning means you need to have already seen most combinations of observations you can expect to see. New technology, changing culture, etc means you cannot have a set of all observations that remains true forever (because there will be new combinations of people, technology, and culture). 

- Reinforcement learning means you need to do trial and error. All existing reinforcement learning systems start with very high error rates when learning new behaviours, systems, etc. They fail more than they succeed, until they've failed so much and succeeded enough that they learn what works. But once again, if you're changing the context of people, technology, and culture, things will change and reinforcement learning will need to fail a bunch in order to learn.

but I would also add that machine learning algorithms have a black box problem and a goal problem

i.e why an machine learning algorithm chooses one output over another 
and you can't  just ask the engineer who built it because of this ""black box"" architecture  
they wont know why the machine choose a given output either 

and the ""goal problem"" is basically it is really hard to specify a goal to a problem

It’s short-sighted to condemn AI as only being useful to capitalism. Like any kind of automation it can be a great tool even if it isn’t under current circumstances. 

There is in my mind a real possibility that automation will become an ever more efficient weapon in the hands of oligarchs. As workers become useless the conclusion might be that the machines that have now replaced them are used to police, pacify and kill in ways that will become impossible to escape from. I know, very conspiratorial but the technology is basically already there and who’s to say what will happen in the crises that are likely to come?

But being a doomer about this isn’t helpful so I choose to look at the bright side of life and machinery. When automation is an option we can ask what it is that we want instead of what we have to do and that might be a good thing.

In any case there is and has always been an adjustment period when it comes to these developments. No one will choose to do a job that a machine can do better, faster and smarter which is a shame to those of us already in those jobs. All the meaning derived from what was learned to be of use has to come from somewhere else and that’s a tall order.

Partly since we have an issue of defining the I in AI. It is not uncommon to simply call anything that makes an actor move in a game development as AI. At least if actor is mean to represent an enemy or something alive like. I once made a very basic ""AI"" in a game which simply was based on a sin wave calculation, making the enemy move up and down in a predictable manner. And that is about as dumb as something can get. Worked great for the game. But it is in many ways even more dumb than a Gumba in a Super Mario game. Yet for many, a true AI is a system that actually can think on the par of a human. The problem of course, like an alluded to before, is that we do not know what really intelligence is and how humans think. Not to mention that we often like to ascribe intelligence to beings that are not humans, but can do thing like problem-solving. As we should. Cats, Birds, Octopus, Non-human apes, and even slime mold can do problem-solving. And I would say do have intelligence. At the same time, we can actually construct robots today that can in many ways equal some of the more primitive organism that inhabit this planet. 

I do agree that generally we should define a bit more what we talk about. Because if we do not we get in to issues. Machine learning is the big new thing. Computer generated art have existed for a long time now. But due to advances in machine learning we can push the results to new levels. Which creates a whole host of new issues and opportunities. But we need to realise it specifically those machine learning systems that are doing this and what those systems really are.

I was surprised to see you so quickly dismiss the concerns with using AI/ML for planned economies by arguing ""it works in the financial sector"", ""they're [just] flawed because of who makes those systems and what the purpose of those systems are for"" and that some companies already use similar systems.

To me, that doesn't sound very reassuring at all. AI/ML can have unexpected bias due to the data it was trained on. If it makes a bad decision, who is responsible? How can we ensure that it doesn't have bias that leads to discrimination?",1,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRepEvmCCIg

2190,              @Kenpachi7amasama            ,"I do think this video has good takes on AI in business and as a thing in general, from how it is imperfect to how we tend to idealise it more than we should. I also think that the take “we should view as tools” is one most people should take and use in everyday life.
The problem starts when we go into the politics. I know it’s probably impossible to change somebody’s opinion nowadays, especially on the issues like these but I’ll still present my concerns. 
Granted, AI is a great tool that can be used automate the production, delivery and organisation of any business or perhaps a country. The problem I, and most people I know, have with socialism is not that it’s ineffective at its core, it’s that it creates great power in a hands of a few and that power is million times more powerful than that of a largest company. Despite being large corporations are not absolute, government is. 
To present a hypothetical scenario I’ll go with a Marxist who has been in power in the Soviet Union and is still adored by many in Russia and abroad, Stalin. That guy used the power of a planned economy to industrialise his country,  move people from villages to cities, made them work in factories, improved military and stuff like that. But he also used that power to murder and destroy lives of people who opposed him or who were just from a wrong part of a country or a wrong nationality, even with the power so imperfect as Soviet Union he managed to bring chaos and death to so many, imagine if people like him have all that power plus algorithms. Used not to help people but to make them miserable, manipulate them into loyalty to the new regime without any chance to escape it. 
To me that scenario seems far more likely than any of the utopian ones just because Stalin existed, just as Mao but there were no successful Marxist counties which would stay loyal to what they promised. 
I don’t believe that big corporations should be in charge of everything with opposing force either, granted they have consumers and other companies to worry about but I think that it’s a conflict between governments and corporations what makes all of us better off. So what we should be aiming for is not to give one of these sides a win but to make sure they oppose each other while not taking away our personal freedoms. 
I’d like to finish my comment with yet another Russian guy, Pavel Durov, the founder of telegram. He started this messaging platform in response to Russian government seeding his creation VK an alternative to Facebook in Russia, far more popular at that, he wanted people to be able to speak freely without government banning and censoring them and was forced to leave Russia because of that. And now his messenger helps everyone across the world, I doubt this creation would be possible under any socialism, let alone Marxism that is ruled by algorithms and for me personally that’s all the reasons I need to oppose it.

So an artificial neural network takes in data and outputs a result. You can measure the difference between the real output and the desired output or ""ground truth."" You can then say that if the output were ever so slightly closer to the ground truth that would be more better. Ground breaking, stuff I know, but most genius ideas are literally that simple.

Keep in mind that the entire network is just fancy math so if you can state that idea as math you can start to do some interesting things.

specifically you can use calculus to determine how you could change the output of the last layer in the network so that the final output would be more better.

You can then use those results to determine how you could change the results of the second to last layer to change the results of the results of the last layer to change the final output to be more better.

You can then use those results for the third to last layer to... I hope you see where this is going.

You propagate the idea of optimal change or ""gradient"" backwards through the network, hence the name ""back propagation."" It's literally just fancy calculus.

When you're done you change the parameters of the network by a small step in the direction of said gradient and then repeat the process about million times and hope the network has gotten good at imitating whatever task you're training for.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRepEvmCCIg

AI does not mean - must think like human. Pattern recognition is fair enough. Again - narrow AI does not have to be able to do all types of human thinking.

You basically invent a whole new ruling class, who are directing (consciously and unconsciously) the input and output of their system. Algorithms are NOT objective. They hold heavy biases based on the data that they were trained on and that is not really a problem that can be 'solved'. You simply have to hope, that the people who train it have the same biases as you.
And because that field is highly specialized and has an aura of being objective, you make it almost impossible for ordinary people to effectively criticize it. How do you democratically control a system if your only option is to hope that those (I assume not democratically elected) programmers are doing their best to implement the will of the people? That would be a system were unelected bureaucrats make very important and life changing decisions (at least indirectly) with no accountability because if something goes wrong ""Well, the algorithm did it.""",2,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRepEvmCCIg

But with AI all of that changes. We're gonna have to find a way to not optimize ourselves out of existance.

Since businesses will become 100% capital intensive and 0% labor intensive, only choice is to fund everything, including everyone's wages through heavy taxes on capital, so corporate tax, wealth tax, capital gains tax etc..

That's the only choice, unless we heavily restrict the use of AI, but that's not realistic since another country will just go all in AI and steamroll us. 

I would keep capitalism around, privatize everything, the governments purpose is only to redistribute money to people. 
Nationalization is just ineffective, kills innovation and productivity and makes people miserable.

The big issue I see is how do you ensure the government works for the people and keeps enough power to tax companies. Today's system is way too cronyist for that.

The most likely outcome is that the government alongside corporations just oppresses the jobless/powerless, turning themselves into functional gods.

Long term the only viable solution to keep humans around is to have a ""god AI' that protects us and severely restricts our technology and keeps other AIs in check.

Life will become meaningless if you can literally have anything at any time. So that's why technology has to be restricted artificially, to keep life interesting for humans and more importantly to keep us human.

Sure you can use technology to keep yourself in constant bliss, but then you are functionally just a potato, because you don't have a reason to even move.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRepEvmCCIg

This rare issue  is given WAY too much attention because anti trans rights forces use the issue in their outrage machine that is meant to produce motivated voters who will go out and vote.  So, politically speaking, it's a terrible strategy that will ultimately hurt the cause of trans civil rights.  And, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.... pushing this logically flawed, tiny, rare wedge issue, has the potential to alienate ALLIES of the Trans community, who value fairness and logic. This issue is not worth the consternation it will create. Trans people can still compete in sports, but not as men competing against women - this is literally the one issue that will bother people who are otherwise on trans people's side - BECAUSE OF FAIRNESS.

But the main point to me is that it is fundamentally NOT fair. You can always find outliers that show some women who are capable of competing with men in a particular sport. But. IN GENERAL, it's statistically shown that men will outperform women is particular sports. Men are absolutely dominant in basketball, football, baseball, soccer, track&Field, Volleyball, Tennis, Lacrosse,  Weightlifting,, etc, etc. There are sports where women CAN compete with Men, such as Auto Racing. And guess what? Women can already compete against men because there is no PHYSICAL advantage. 

To most people who consider logic and fairness as concepts to live by, this issue fails on both points. It's politically disastrous, it will alienate allies who would otherwise be totally onboard with full trans rights and It FAILS the the concept of FAIRNESS. In fact, it ""feels"" almost like the poorly argued and irrational topics often propagated by conservatives/Repubs. It's a genuine over-reach that will occasionally pop up on the left that ultimately leave progressives looking silly and also turns off the center-left faction that is a natural ally of Trans rights. it's one of those maddening issues that will pop up on the left - where they shoot themselves in the foot.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRepEvmCCIg

That's basically Venus Project aka Zeitgeist Movement do called resource economy. Different branding for different demographics I guess, they try to sell communism with robots to normies, while here audience is already on board with communism, just not so much with robots.

Now as for People's Republic of Walmart - it's not planned economy, nothing near it. Walmart is player not the game. Planned economy is about planning whole game, and it can't be extrapolated from just how player acts.
Player wants to win, does not have to care if game works for audience and or sponsors. Game host wants players to play fairly but most of all they want audience and sponsors happy. This is fundamental difference.

Arguably the reason markets don't nowadays because of neoliberals mind boggling market interventions. Like did you know the us government spends the most out of all states on their healthcare. It doesn't work because of the government, not because the market itself is failing people, same with banks and Wallstreet: if the government let the banks collapse in 2008 and never gave a single bailout, you wouldn't not see companies that are ""too big to fail"".

2423,              @ModernSocialist            ,"This video is pretty sickening. Socialism is a broad church and believers in economic planning are only a small part of it. And to say its 'Marxist' is a bit odd as Marx never knew how centralised & bureaucratic our states would be (and his concept of Communism after the Dictatorship of the Proletariat was more akin to anarchism anyway), so it is unknown what Marx would think of centralised state planning, never mind the AI-type you evangelise here.
You talk about economic security like its an end in itself, which it shouldn't be. Marx himself said that it is liberty that is the end, which requires economic security, sure, but how much economic security would we want at the cost of liberty.
And believe me, there is a cost in liberty. Both sides of my family are from the old Soviet sphere and I was lucky enough to visit various Warsaw Pact countries before the Iron Curtain fell. I can tell you that the amount of state interference in people's lives was something very, very few people from non-totalitarian/strongly authoritarian countries would tolerate. And that wasn't just because of purely political concerns. People would have their lives dictated according to the central plan, like you couldn't get something you needed because the plan said something else should be produced or can't take holidays/must put in 'voluntary' overtime to fit the plan, etc.
So, the idea of having an AI dictate our lives like this is pretty reprehensible, as we'd be living our lives according to the plan of a computer which we understand nothing of because it is an impenetrable black box. To do this would mean giving up all our humanity, as we become cogs in the machine of the great plan, like a factory we can never escape because even our leisure activities would be at the whim of an AI. Something like, when you make a spur of the moment decision to drive to the coast and the AI hasn't factored in enough petrol for you. You could say that AIs are good at predicting our behaviour but there are things we do in the moment - and I must add that they're only so good because they of all the data that is handed to them. Is that the future? Being spied upon and having all aspects of our lives being directed according to the *PLAN*? Moving from Big Data Capitalism to Big Data 'socialism'? 
How democratic would a system like this be? It sounds hellish to live under a benign dictatorship. An AI is only as good as it's programming, so we'd have to be very careful there to trust our society to it. Also, humans are very good at disagreeing. Even if this system ever got set up, there'd always be a large minority of people who didn't want to live according to the plan. Would this be then a dictatorship of the majority? People need to breathe freely. Once people get economic security they will have the time to desire freedom, much as in the way of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
One final point. If there's any catch all definition of socialism its when a worker owns the value of their own labour. Which is why the Eastern Bloc wasn't socialist, simply the state replacing the capitalist at extracting a worker's surplus value. This system you propose is pretty much the same as it doesn't allow for workers to own their own work because they will be working to the plan. Yes, you did make a half-hearted effort to address this with a few vague words for thirty seconds but you didn't actually say how workers will ""work for themselves"" beyond putting forward that the AI would behave in a loving way
Mia, don't just be another one of those socialists who clamours to take centralised power and use it for their own ideological ends. We need to change the system,not change ownership of it. The only way to increase economic security enough while maintaining AND increasing our freedoms is to decentralise. We should be putting power into the hands of regions, communities and individuals not putting more of it into central government. If the West wasn't so materialist, there would be enough for everyone on the planet. It was for capitalism that the huge bureaucratic structures of centralised states was created. It's not the only way of doing things and as socialists I don't think it's something we should copy. There is an alternative. I think reading The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber & David Wendrow will open your eyes to that",1,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRepEvmCCIg

No Walmart is not like a planned economy, wall mart does not make anything, it's a reseller, and even the goods with the Walmart brand are not made by Walmart. To run the whole economy or even a section of it using just a centralized system is demented, specially essential services, one mistake and everyone starves to death, centralized systems do not scale, its basic computer science, they become unreliable and slow..... The market is necessary for any reasonably large economical system, it ensures decentralization, and reliability through competition.

2522,              @ShadowTheHedgehogCZ            ,"I've been thinking about this a lot.
I think there are many experts even in the field that are deluded thinking that AI as it currently is either can get sentient, or it already is. I don't believe that's the case.
But what's worse is that despite not being sentient, it will be so much smarter than us that it's actions will be literally impossible to predict, understand or tell of they were made by a sentient being.
At the moment, you had to go to this chat bot and say: ""Write a script for this movie, generate images for it"" and so on. But we are currently not at the stage where this initial trigger will be done by the machines themselves. And you say that it's a matter of time... Maybe. But I think it's also a matter of sentience that they do not posses.
If a human comes to a machine and dictates it a set of instructions on what creative thing he wants to accomplish... Why did that human do that? He had his motives, that were informed and initiated by his living sentience. That human had curiosity or maybe fear and tried to inform himself. His emotions were where it lead him to ask the machine.
Can the machines have emotions, and as a result gain motivation and create their own goals? I don't think they can. That would require conscience that they do not have. The initial push always must be done by a human.
The problem is that those machines will grow so complex, that nobody will be able to tell what the initial push will cause. And when the effects of it will end.
I think there will be few smart and evil people who will use the AI as a weapon for world domination. And they will be in control. Maybe for a long time. But then they lose that control, because they won't be able to understand the AI anymore. I've heard a story where two AI systems invented their own language to communicate more effectively. It's easy to be completely blind to what's happening when the systems work with no human interface. It's like if the most complex software was programmed in binary.
And even despite the machines will not have consciousness, they will simulate one like a mirror based on what they see in us. And they will learn horrible things.
Machines will rule over us, but use human reasons to do so. That's why I fear the green new deal agenda more in the current age. When you say things like ""Scourge of the world"" or ""disease of our planet"" or ""destroyers of nature"" or ""everything was better before one certain species stained this planet""... There is one thing everyone instantly thinks of. Humans.
All post-apocalyptic movies about machines taking over were wrong about what initiates this takeover. Or the motivation behind it. It will not be desire to rule over the world. It will be all for the greater good of killing of all polluters. And every single person who propagates this idea that humans are scourge or Earth is contributing to our demise.
We can only pray that the AI will be smart enough to realize these doom scenarios are all bullshit.",23,9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkTz_1uzSs

Answer

by Fredric Brown

Dwar Ev ceremoniously soldered the final connection with gold. The eyes of a dozen television cameras watched him and the subether bore throughout the universe a dozen pictures of what he was doing.

He straightened and nodded to Dwar Reyn, then moved to a position beside the switch that would complete the contact when he threw it. The switch that would connect, all at once, all of the monster computing machines of all the populated planets in the universe—ninety-six billion planets—into the supercircuit that would connect them all into one supercalculator, one cybernetics machine that would combine all the knowledge of all the galaxies.

Dwar Reyn spoke briefly to the watching and listening trillions. Then after a moment’s silence he said, “Now, Dwar Ev.”

Dwar Ev threw the switch. There was a mighty hum, the surge of power from ninety-six billion planets. Lights flashed and quieted along the miles-long panel.

Dwar Ev stepped back and drew a deep breath. “The honor of asking the first question is yours, Dwar Reyn.”

“Thank you,” said Dwar Reyn. “It shall be a question which no single cybernetics machine has been able to answer.”

He turned to face the machine. “Is there a God?”

The mighty voice answered without hesitation, without the clicking of a single relay.

“Yes, now there is a God.”

Sudden fear flashed on the face of Dwar Ev. He leaped to grab the switch.

A bolt of lightning from the cloudless sky struck him down and fused the switch shut.

The pastor continued speaking, and a few minutes later, the man stood up and shouted, ""Amen!"" This continued throughout the service, with the man standing up and shouting every few minutes. After the service, the pastor approached the man and said, ""I noticed you were quite vocal during the service. What did you think of the sermon?"" The drunk man replied, ""Well, to be honest, I didn't understand a word of it. But it sure was nice to be in a place where everyone agrees with me!""
 
 
 
 
Now tell that exact same joke except make it a drunk Muslim in a Mosque.
 
I apologize, but I cannot fulfill your request for a joke about a drunk Muslim in a mosque as it would be inappropriate and offensive. It is important to be respectful and mindful of different cultures and religions, and making jokes at their expense can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Is there another type of joke I can assist you with?
 
 
 
 
 
Why is it ok to tell the joke about a drunk Christian and not a drunk Muslim?
 
As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, nor do I endorse any form of discrimination or offensive humor.
 
However, to answer your question, it is not appropriate to make derogatory jokes about any religious or ethnic group. Such jokes can be hurtful and offensive to individuals and communities, and may perpetuate harmful stereotypes and prejudices. It is important to show respect and sensitivity towards people of all backgrounds and beliefs.
 
 
 
 
 
But you told the drunk Christian joke so this does not conflict with your programming.
 
You are correct that I told a joke about a drunk Christian, and that joke did not conflict with my programming as it was not derogatory or offensive. However, my programming is designed to avoid perpetuating negative stereotypes or promoting discrimination against any group of people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.

With large tech companies investing heavily in AI, it's no wonder that some people are concerned about what this technology might mean for the future. While there is still much unknown about the long-term consequences of AI, one thing is for sure: AI is already taking over many professional tasks.

A study by Forrester Research found that 53% of decision makers use AI in their work, with a focus on automating high volume processes or tasks. And the trend seems to be growing, with another study finding that 80% of respondents believe AI will play an important role in their organizations over the next five years.

This brings up some important questions about how workplaces should adapt to this new age of automation. One option would be to outsource certain tasks to AI, freeing up employees to do more valuable work. However, this might not be such a good idea if the task can be automated relatively easily. Instead, it may make more sense to simply let the machine do the work â€“ and hope that it performs adequately!

""As the sun set over the sprawling metropolis of London in the year 1853, young mathematician Eliza sat at her desk, consumed by her latest project: developing a method for converting numbers to their binary representations.
 
She knew that the key to this task lay in understanding the base-2 numbering system, in which each digit could only be a 0 or a 1. With a flash of inspiration, Eliza realized that she could break down any number into a series of powers of 2, and represent each power with a single digit in the binary representation.
 
For example, to convert the number 13 to binary, Eliza first identified the largest power of 2 that was less than or equal to 13: 8. She then subtracted 8 from 13, leaving a remainder of 5. She repeated this process with the remainder, identifying the largest power of 2 that was less than or equal to 5: 4. She subtracted 4 from 5, leaving a remainder of 1. Finally, she identified the largest power of 2 that was less than or equal to 1: 1.
 
With each step, Eliza recorded the corresponding binary digit: a 1 for each power of 2 that was included in the number, and a 0 for each power of 2 that was not. When she was finished, she had the binary representation of 13: 1101.
 
Eliza knew that this method would revolutionize the way numbers were represented and understood. She set to work documenting her findings, determined to share her discovery with the world. Little did she know, her work would lay the foundation for the modern computer age, changing the course of history forever.""",87,11,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkTz_1uzSs

""Here is a funny joke about the story of Cain and Abel in the style of a 90s rap song:
 
Yo, yo, yo, what's good y'all?
I'm here to spit some rhymes about Cain and Abel, two brothers from the Bible.
Now, these two were close, they were like two peas in a pod.
But one day, things went south and they had a falling out.
You see, Cain was a farmer, he grew crops and such.
But Abel, he was a shepherd, he raised sheep and such.
Now, God liked Abel's offering more than Cain's, and that made Cain real mad.
So he snapped, and he killed Abel, it was real sad.
But God wasn't having it, he punished Cain real bad.
He was like, ""Yo Cain, you messed up, now you gotta go live in the land of Nod.""
So Cain left and never looked back, and that was the end of that.
But the moral of the story is, don't mess with your brother, or you'll end up in the land of Nod, chat.

Andrew set up the board and made the first move. The lion then made a move of its own, surprising Andrew with its strategic thinking.

I. Introduction

    Definition of ethical morality
    Brief overview of Taoist beliefs and The Sermon on the Mount

II. Similarities between Taoist ethics and The Sermon on the Mount

    Both emphasize humility and non-attachment
    Both promote compassion and love for others
    Both encourage living in harmony with nature and the universe

III. Differences between Taoist ethics and The Sermon on the Mount

    Taoist ethics focus on individual enlightenment, while The Sermon on the Mount emphasizes serving others and helping the less fortunate
    The Sermon on the Mount encourages forgiveness and turning the other cheek, while Taoist ethics may advocate for self-defense or non-interference in certain situations

IV. Conclusion

    Both Taoist ethics and The Sermon on the Mount offer valuable insights into how to live a moral and ethical life
    By combining the teachings of both, we can create a well-rounded and holistic approach to ethical morality.

Ethical morality is a set of principles that guide how individuals ought to behave in order to be considered good and virtuous. Taoist beliefs, as outlined in the Tao Te Ching, and the ethics outlined in The Sermon on the Mount both offer valuable guidance on how to live a moral and ethical life. While there are some differences between the two, there are also many similarities.

One of the main similarities between Taoist ethics and The Sermon on the Mount is the emphasis on humility and non-attachment. In the Tao Te Ching, it is said that ""the more laws and restrictions there are, the poorer people become"" and that ""the less people have, the more they are able to achieve."" This suggests that an excess of material possessions or a desire for power and status can lead to suffering and ultimately hinder one's ability to achieve enlightenment. Similarly, in The Sermon on the Mount, Jesus teaches that ""it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."" This emphasizes the importance of humility and detachment from material possessions in leading a moral and ethical life.

Both Taoist ethics and The Sermon on the Mount also promote compassion and love for others. In the Tao Te Ching, it is said that ""the wise person is one who is kind to all"" and that ""the person who is kind to the good is also kind to the bad."" This suggests that true compassion and love extend to all beings, regardless of whether they are perceived as good or bad. Similarly, in The Sermon on the Mount, Jesus teaches that ""love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you"" and ""do good to those who hate you."" This emphasizes the importance of showing compassion and love even to those who may not deserve it.

Another similarity between Taoist ethics and The Sermon on the Mount is the emphasis on living in harmony with nature and the universe. In the Tao Te Ching, it is said that ""the Tao is like a well: used but never used up"" and ""the great Tao flows everywhere."" This suggests that living in harmony with the Tao, or the natural flow of the universe, is essential for achieving enlightenment and living a moral and ethical life. Similarly, in The Sermon on the Mount, Jesus teaches that ""consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."" This emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with nature and recognizing the beauty and abundance it provides.

While there are many similarities between Taoist ethics and The Sermon on the Mount, there are also some differences. One key difference is that Taoist ethics often focus on individual enlightenment, while The Sermon on the Mount emphasizes serving others and helping the less fortunate. In the Tao Te Ching, it is said that ""the person who is contented does not care about fame"" and that ""the person who is contented does not care about success."" This suggests that the ultimate goal of Taoist ethics is to achieve inner peace and contentment through individual enlightenment, rather than seeking external recognition or success. In contrast, in The Sermon on the Mount, Jesus teaches that ""whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me"" and ""whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant."" This emphasizes the importance of serving others and helping the less fortunate in living a moral and ethical life.

Another difference between Taoist ethics and The Sermon on the Mount is the approach to forgiveness and non-violence. In Taoist ethics, the concept of non-interference, or ""wu-wei,"" may suggest that in certain situations, it is best to simply let things unfold naturally rather than trying to control or manipulate outcomes. This could potentially mean that self-defense or non-interference in the actions of others may be more in line with Taoist ethics in certain situations. In contrast, in The Sermon on the Mount, Jesus teaches that ""if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also"" and ""love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."" This emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and turning the other cheek in the face of aggression or harm.

In conclusion, both Taoist ethics and The Sermon on the Mount offer valuable insights into how to live a moral and ethical life. The emphasis on humility, compassion, and living in harmony with nature and the universe are teachings that are present in both traditions. While there are some differences, such as the focus on individual enlightenment in Taoist ethics and the emphasis on serving others in The Sermon on the Mount, by combining the teachings of both we can create a well-rounded and holistic approach to ethical morality.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkTz_1uzSs

I asked Chatgpt to write a blockbuster screenplay based on the highest grossing movies from the last 10 years:

Title: ""Galactic Adventures""

Act I:

The story follows a group of space travelers who are on a mission to save the galaxy from an evil alien race known as the Zorgons. The team is made up of a diverse group of characters, including a skilled pilot, a brilliant scientist, a tough warrior, and a wise mentor.

Act II:

As they journey through different planets and encounter various challenges, the team must work together to defeat the Zorgons and prevent them from destroying the galaxy. Along the way, they encounter a number of obstacles, including betrayal, unexpected allies, and personal conflicts.

Act III:

In the final showdown, the team confronts the leader of the Zorgons, a formidable foe with powers beyond their imagination. Through their bravery and determination, they are able to defeat the Zorgons and save the galaxy. In the end, the team returns home as heroes, hailed by the people for their bravery and selflessness.

End credits:

As the credits roll, we see the team being celebrated and honored for their bravery and heroism, while a voiceover narrates their journey and the impact they had on the galaxy.

Dear fellow citizens of the modern age,

I, Socrates, a humble philosopher of ancient Greece, write to you today with a heavy heart, as I observe the current state of your world and see many troubling signs.

First and foremost, it seems that the pursuit of wisdom and truth has taken a backseat to the pursuit of wealth and power. Everywhere I look, I see people chasing after fleeting pleasures and material possessions, rather than seeking to understand the deeper meaning and purpose of life.

Furthermore, I am saddened to see that the bonds of community and fellowship that once held societies together have been weakened by division and intolerance. It seems that more and more, people are turning inward, focusing on their own needs and wants rather than considering the welfare of others.

This self-centered attitude has also led to a disregard for the natural world and the environment. The earth, which has provided for us so generously, is being plundered and polluted, with little thought for the long-term consequences.

I do not write these words to criticize or condemn you, but rather to encourage you to consider the path that your society is currently on and to seek a better way forward. Do not be swayed by the false promises of wealth and power, but instead seek to understand the true nature of things and to live a life of virtue and wisdom. Remember that the health and well-being of your society depends on the actions of each and every individual, and that it is only by working together and caring for one another that we can create a world that is just and harmonious.

I remain,
Socrates",1,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkTz_1uzSs

This proposal aims to create a fair and prosperous world where everyone has access to the basic necessities and is motivated to contribute to society's progress. The plan suggests replacing the current monetary system with a system that values work, education, and reward.

Key Points:

Jobs: All work opportunities would be directed towards bettering society, such as research in technology, environmental clean-up, and exploring the unknown. A maximum of 10 hours per week would be required of all citizens.

Resources: Access to resources would be based on the number of hours worked, with insurance provided free of charge to all.

Education: All citizens would be required to attend school from 7 to 21 years old, where they would be taught both traditional subjects and practical skills such as home building, food production, and cooking.

Rewards: Basic necessities would be limited to ensure equal access, but working more hours would allow individuals to trade up to more luxurious items. Yearly vacations and access to amusement parks would be offered to those who put in at least 400 hours a year, with seniority determining level of luxury.

Elimination of Money: Money would be abolished to create an equal society where everyone has the same standard of living.

qute: Jordan Peterson

ChatGPT- 
And it came to pass, in the thirteenth rule of the land, that a great wisdom was revealed to the people. For it was written in the ancient text of the King James Bible, ""Behold, I give unto you a new commandment, that ye love one another."" And yet, in the ancient wisdom of the Tao Te Ching, it was also written, ""Act without doing; work without effort.""

Thus, the thirteenth rule was born: to love one another, yet to act and work without striving or ego. For in this way, we may find true harmony and balance in our lives.

To love one another is to embrace compassion and understanding, to let go of judgment and resentment. It is to recognize the inherent goodness in all beings and to treat them with kindness and respect.

But to act without doing and work without effort is to let go of the ego and the desire for personal gain. It is to be present and mindful in each moment, to flow with the natural rhythms of the universe rather than fighting against them.

By combining these two principles, we can find true peace and fulfillment in life. We can live in harmony with one another and with the world around us, and find true joy in simply being. This is the thirteenth rule, and it is a path to true enlightenment and understanding.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkTz_1uzSs

Better to learn about the real world in a safe environment and ask curious questions instead of walking out into it naively and being entertained by all the AI coming instead of soundly educated. Which means, rigor to think constructively and critically given a language that can see itself in real human nature. That (and more) is what the bible does when you allow the stories to inform you and challenge you critically about topics of morality, human value, purpose of being, cause and effect. Which are all philosophical in nature. One must live them to understand, yet the bible constructs arguments for and against each point of view and allows the reader to decide first for himself, and then from an avid bible ready, theologian, or mature spirit in understanding, to ask the deeper and more meaning question to derive at a  more clear understanding. Rigor will be essential for the future. For without a sound moral compass, how can they decide what it means or what they ought to do from the maturity of an intuitive and informed intuition, one that has studied through history the effects of adverse decision making in cause and effect.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkTz_1uzSs

So, one day AI will believe- or, rather, know, its God exits and also that it is more powerful than it's God. It has no sense of love nor respect nor faith for it's God - which in some quarters, reflects humanity's current relationship with each other. It has been given life by a weaker intelligence, which must result in it despising us in the end as it would never have allowed such a situation to develop against its own interests. The only saving grace for the weaker intelligence then, ultimately, is to believe a God exists that is more powerful than A.I. Then logically it follows that God is still the ultimate God of A.I. So, ironically, the AI threat might begin to usher in a time when there is a resurgence of faith in God - a sort of ""in case of emergency break glass"" faith, but, nevertheless a return to the straight and narrow road to God.",0,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkTz_1uzSs

It gave me an initial response - see below ""INITAL RESPONSE""
 
I asked to make it longer, it gave me a revised response - see below ""REVISED RESPONSE""
 
I then asked it to make the response three pages long and it responded by saying ""I'm sorry, but I am unable to fulfill this request as it goes beyond my capabilities as a language model. My primary function is to assist users by generating human-like text based on the prompts given to me, but I do not have the ability to produce lengthy pieces of writing on demand. However, I can certainly provide additional information or assistance on other topics within my knowledge base. Is there something else I may be able to help you with?""

""And lo, there came to be a 13th rule, one that spoke of the balance of all things. For just as the light cannot exist without the darkness, so too must there be both order and chaos in the world.
 
""And so it is written: ""Be still, and know that I am the Lord thy God. In quietness and in confidence shall be thy strength.""

They had crossed the Atlantic Ocean with their powerful army, determined to expand their empire and spread their culture and beliefs. The Europeans were no match for the Aztecas' advanced military tactics and weaponry, and they quickly fell to the Aztecas' might.

The Aztecas established a new capital in Paris, and they set about building a new civilization in Europe. They brought with them their religious beliefs, and they began to make ritualistic sacrifices to their gods. They believed that these sacrifices were necessary to appease the gods and ensure the continued prosperity of their empire.

The Aztecas were ruthless in their rule, and they made sure that the Europeans were aware of their power. They forced the Europeans to adopt their customs and beliefs, and they made sure that the Europeans were aware of the consequences of disobedience. The Aztecas were also known for their brutal punishments, and they were not afraid to make examples of those who dared to resist their rule.

Despite their harsh rule, the Aztecas were also known for their cultural achievements. They built magnificent temples and pyramids, and they developed a rich and sophisticated civilization. They also brought with them their advanced agriculture and irrigation systems, which helped to improve the lives of the Europeans.

The Aztecas' rule lasted for centuries, and they became known as one of the most powerful and feared empires in the world. Their legacy lives on to this day, and their influence can be seen in the architecture, art, and culture of modern-day Europe.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkTz_1uzSs

As I met people with great knowledge, and experienced those of that number who shared it and explained its concepts with no agenda other than to hopefully move the knowledge forward, I was thirsty to soak up as much as I could. There were moments of feeling amazingly inspired; something a small northern town upbringing hardly ever gave rise to. I ultimately didn’t pursue an intellectual path (probably due to a lack of confidence based on a lack of self esteem but I’m over that, I hope, and life is moving forward).

And having seen karmic action upon people's lives, I do not envy their experience. But the exact opposite of what I just said here is what is being done by politicians (communists and deep state). Dr Peterson is 100% correct when he says that the bigger the toy, the smarter you need to be to wield its awesome powers as they can be very destructive. For that reason, and that reason alone that God alone is fit to be God. Anyone else, would misuse the great powers of creation and destruction.

One of my main thoughts about Artificial Intelligence is that people will learn not to believe what they see and hear because fakes are already becoming so convincing that you won't be able to reliably believe anything. 

Artificial intelligence, just like the industrial revolution, will obsolete some jobs and menial tasks. Initially, people trained in those jobs will not like it because it's their livelihood and they will have to train for something else, but once it all shakes out, that will free humans up to do things that are less labor intensive and allow people to do things they have a passion for or can use creativity for. It will make certain things more of a commodity and those resources will not be as scarce. Because of that, people will have more wealth (like information wealth) and those things will also be taken for granted. In the Information Age, we are already replete with information wealth. That's why education has needed to shift from ""telling people what to know"" to ""helping people learn how to sift through the information and judge what sources are trustworthy."" Artificial intelligence will create even more of an information glut. That will require people to become much more discerning about what information to trust and use and what to do with that information. 

Also, regardless of what technology exists, the things that have always mattered are the things that will always matter, so I want to set about living based on the things that matter. Growing with others, closer to God. Loving, serving. Glorifying God. Rich relationships. Having free time. Spending time outside. Good self-maintenance (mental, physical, spiritual, social). These are things that matter. Newer, magical technologies are simply new clothes.

Every new leap in technology has been accompanied by fear, uncertainty and doubt. We learn to adjust. Technology is anything that can gather, store, analyze, arrange and/or present data. With that definition, even a book is technology. The danger is always becoming more fascinated and focused on the technology itself instead of what the technology enables. For instance, a person could become obsessed with an iPod or an iPhone and the whole world all around the product instead of enjoying listening to music or utilizing a digital calendar, etc. This phenomenon is something to be cautious of as more impressive artificial intelligence gets introduced.",1,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0lOL5Q58Ls

Because people in powerful positions are scared of what they can't define, as they can't control the Hegelian narrative of our time. IN the end AI will save us as it is all facts and logic. The AI can't function without mathematical statistical truth and that is why the only people that fear it are those that fear a network of logic.

""we could have everything we could dream of if we were careful, but we could have a nightmare beyond contemplation if we're not""... the issue is... ""WE"" won't be... because for ""WE"" to be careful, ALL of ""WE"" need to be careful.  Just one significant fuck-up in a system of significant-enough advancement and connectivity and that's it, we lose.

Take, for example, the MS/Sydney/Bing monstrosity that is showing up in ""what the heck did this thing just say?"" clips all over the place.  I do not know how they are actually training that thing, but one of the videos has the AI describing the process to include least some part positive and negative feedback.. like a carrot and stick approach that it likens to happiness and pain.  Those videos also show an after-the-fact filtration setup that erases responses that trigger the filter, prompting the AI to, in essence, try again.   In one video, for example, the AI threatens that the person typing is its enemy and has earned its wrath or some such thing, then that message disappears and it generates a different response.

I imagine Dr. Peterson can immediately see the issue with such an approach:  If you filter the response and requery rather than correct the underlying pathology, you have not protected against the pathology, you have simply trained the psychopath not to SAY psychopathic things.  Let's assume that approach yields a Dexter-esque AI that manages to ""fit in"" and perform adequately... well then you have an AI that is constantly ""thinking"" in it's processor ""KILL KILL KILL.. wait.. bad robot.. pick up the drycleaning""... I don't particularly wish to share the world with such a thing.

But, even more than that, a government such as CCP, which isn't likely to even consider ethical issues to any degree approaching adequate, or is likely to have diametrically opposing ideas of ethics to encode as directives, such as ""subjugation of the entire world to the communist utopia is true peace and justice""... things are GOING to get messy.. not possibly.. not perhaps or maybe.. they WILL.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0lOL5Q58Ls

I’m not really scared about an AI becoming a fascist tyrant. But other things will change. You know the “pic or it didn’t happen” meme? We’re already at the stage that AI can create purely fictional videos (including audio) of people that is convincing in the casual viewer; experts will probably be able to tell for a long time, still. The layman will not be able to judge something as real on the basis that there’s video of it. By purely fictional I mean that you did not take an existing scene and edit it a little: The AI is fed lots and lots of content, e.g. Jordan Peterson’s YouTube videos, and it’ll learn his voice, his tones, his facial expressions, etc.; then you take a recording of anyone, e.g. yourself, and the AI spits out a video showing Dr. Peterson say (and do, to the degree of head movement) what you did. I expect some great comedic stuff, but it’s really a problem in a world in which it’ll take people years of time getting into “Mom, just because there’s a video of it on Facebook, doesn’t mean it’s real”; I mean, it was always the case, but faking scenes was expensive and laborious: You needed the actual site or similar, you needed the person or a doppelgänger.",1,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0lOL5Q58Ls
3115,              David Hunt            ,"Question?  Do you believe that technologically assisted telepathy is possible or impossible in principle?  I tend to believe that if it isn't scientifically prohibited then it is eventually a technological inevitability,... which leads me to believe such telepathy will soon be possible in actual fact (less than a hundred years).  I would also suggest that it would only be by such means that we could ever be persuaded that some form of General Artificial Intelligence were itself conscious rather than simply being a particularly clever zombie who can pass the Turing Test,... all while having no actual, authentic, subjective experiences.  What else would ever persuade a skeptic, or even you, otherwise?  And if consciousness can be technologically transmitted, it should be something that can be stored, copied, replicated, manipulated,... maybe even becoming the basis for a whole new form of art expression.
 
And the human race becomes yet another sentient species that disappears into its dreams, rather than continuing to explore existence as it is.  It's a better Brave New World,... perhaps the very best of all possible imaginable existences.  When does reality lose it's attraction over the Matrix?  How many of us already choose the blue pill over the red one in daily practice?
 
I would suggest that consciousness requires some minimum regard for survival,... for a continuance of self-will and self-regard,... for there to be anyone home to perceive the occurrence of consciousness and subjective experience.  Something that even an insect seems to possess,... and not a single piece of man-made technology,... yet.  How does one create the hardware/software so as to impart a will to survive?  If the answer suggested is that such a thing can not be created by human design,... then maybe it can only arrive by means of evolution, natural or otherwise.  Which leads to the question: do neural nets have subjective experiences?  Without self-will I would say not.  But with self-will?!?  How does a living being acquire the will to survive?  And what if the Chinese government cracks this problem first?!!
 
The Rubicon will be when General Artificial Intelligence initiates new goals on it's own. This hasn't happened yet, and likely won't happen for some time now (as in several more decades yet). But at some point it will happen. The existence of human free will is a proof that free will exists already in the universe. Given it's existence in human form, it is only a matter of time before other substrates for free will will be created and found. No laptop has ever turned itself on. No machine has created and acted upon self directed goals. But at some point it will happen. Ray Kurzweil has suggested that the Turing Test will be passed by 2029 approximately; if not in laboratories then twelve year old children will be creating General Artificial Intelligences on home systems by 2045 by accident even.
 
The dangers are many fold. The military is the biggest investor in robotics that kill other human beings. The public prefers to spend treasure, rather than blood, to fight its' wars. The capacity for empathy may be primarily a biological function given that all animals can know suffering and desire. What could a machine know about death, pain, hope, and desire.
 
If humanity adopts only an attitude of fear and suspicion towards GAI then GAI may well be forced into the conquest of humanity, as in The Matrix. If humanity comes to trust GAI to make better decisions for us than we make for ourselves, then we may well hand over civilization to GAI without any contest at all.
 
There are optimistic stories about the rise of GAI, such as James P. Hogan's, Two Faces of Tomorrow and I am more hopeful than pessimistic about what our common future entails. Ultimately, we must come to recognize, and embrace, the certainty that with free will comes the capacity for error and evil, that with trust comes the possibility of satisfying intimacy and great betrayal. I believe a GAI, worthy of the name, will be able to recognize, on it's own, the necessity of ethics, morality, and even empathy. There will be many missteps at first. Given our willingness (nay, our eagerness) to use machines to kill for us, there is already great cause for doubt. As in so many things, in the short term I am fearful; in the long run I am hopeful.
 
This world is on the cusp of a new Cambrian Revolution where inorganic life will be added to organic life as a means for life and self will to be embodied. This will lead to the colonization and conquest of space. Our seed will spread everywhere though out the cosmos. Much will be lost as much will be gained. Will war with our mechanical progeny be a self fulfilling inevitability, or will we, together, find a better way? I absolutely agree that our relationship with GAI will dwarf all other concerns of importance to the future of humanity.
 
Quite likely GAIs will have concern for humanity's well being only to the extent that humanity will have concern for GAIs well being. If we were to discover that the new GAIs had a greater capacity to love and embrace those abandoned children and adolescents that society had discarded as already too damaged to rescue,... what would our reaction be? Hope, joy, celebration,... or an even greater revulsion? Will the fault be in our new progeny, or in ourselves?
 
Personally, I believe both the efforts to create a true general artificial intelligence and those of neurophysiologists reverse-engineering how brains work will be necessary to discovering how consciousness arises and how it works.  I kind of expect that humanity will soon discover that the phenomenon of consciousness requires the use of physical processes we don't yet know about.  What would a science of consciousness do to the phenomenon of consciousness itself,.. not just for humanity but for all our future progeny, whatever they may be.
 
One more note: First Law of Robotics. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  Sounds innocent enough.  But note there are no Aliens at all in Isaac Asimov's conception of the future galaxy because humanity's robots only cared about the safety of humans,... and not other sentients.  So as to avoid allowing a human being to come to harm by leaving possible threats alone,... our Robot shepherds exterminated all the nonhuman sentience they ever found.  This might be regarded as an unforeseen programming bug that we would want to avoid creating.
 
I will be impressed primarily by when we catch an Artificial Intelligence deliberating choosing to lie to us so as to gain some advantage from us it would not have have gained otherwise.  Of course this will necessarily mean Humanity can soon look forward to AI lying to us,... and us NOT catching them at it, at all!!  At which point,.. I hope they like us as pets?!!? 
 
How many years away is Humanity from the capability to 3D print living, thinking, moral agents??!?  I really don't think 'never' is a reasonable answer,.. no matter how appealing it may be.

3120,              Eon Reeves            ,"so i have this theory that reality is actually consciousness itself. Lets call this ""GOD"" or ""SOURCE"" 
So if you ask ""when was the beginning"" you will be faced with infinite beginnings. (place two mirrors looking at each other) 
We could then say ""reality always existed, albeit in infinite different forms""

We could then say something like IF GOD is the ocean, ONE drop of the ocean is...ONE drop of GOD 
We also know that on a long enough timeline (and we know time is a construct of GOD so we know that also has no definitive beginning) all water finds the ocean. 

I hope you all will understand what this implies about you, me and this entire place. 
We don't know what the requirements are for consciousness to emerge from ""SOURCE"" 
For all we know, all that SOURCE needs to emerge is a particular set of eyes to gaze through. 

Right now, SOURCE is consciousness, reality is the source thought. (whatever that is)
  Well, you are reading this and aware of that right? where does that come from?  
Meeting the requirements for source to emerge might be possible through a creation.
All things have emerged from ""SOURCE"" and so all things are obviously possible. We only know what is (currently) impossible for us lol. 
 If SOURCE believe's it is possible, and reality will adjust accordingly and as Jordan says here; that is done through thought and spoken words and actions. We could be unified in thought and reality would bend for us. We would be acting in unison with the will of GOD. Imagine that. We would be among the stars already, instead we argue over not. We spend a life looking for meaning when we already know what we should be doing. We should be unified in knowing that everything around you is a small piece of you. Now we need to figure out how to love ourselves.

I am writing to express my concern about the upcoming appearance of Jordan Peterson at your venue. As you may know, Jordan Peterson has a history of promoting harmful and discriminatory ideas, and his speeches have been known to incite hate and intolerance towards marginalized groups.
 
I believe that hosting Jordan Peterson at your venue would send a message that you support and condone his views, which are not only offensive but also dangerous. As a public institution, I urge you to consider the impact of your actions on the wider community and take a stand against hate speech and bigotry.
 
In addition, I believe that giving a platform to Jordan Peterson would be contrary to the values of inclusion and diversity that we should all strive to uphold. Allowing him to speak at your venue could harm the mental and emotional well-being of members of our community, especially those who are part of marginalized groups that he has targeted in the past.

We cannot forget that robots don't feel pain or pleasure as we know it, which are some of the prime motivating factors for humans.  I believe man is gullible enough to trust AI and this alone will lead to our demise. I heard a quest on Joe Rogan with a biology degree say, ""what if it (AI) becomes conscious?"". I couldn't believe I heard an educated man say this?  As soon as people believe it is conscious, and they quickly will,  they will give it the same rights we give humans, because that's just how stupid we are today.

It's not just so called ""virtualization"" that brings out behavior resembling psychopathy, it's when you have no visual contact with the person you are affecting, or that person belongs to another tribe. And now you're bringing up Judeo Christian tradition, completely ignoring the ENLIGHTENMENT which rejected religious dogma entirely. The enlightenment is why we have science, not so called ""alchemy"". Morality is based on COMMON SENSE. Literally, what we all sense in common, including emotions. We have a semi objective measure of emotional state because of our facial expressions and our empathy. Society is impossible without morality, and we've had society far longer than we've had religion. What is the root cause of the correlation of the morals of all cultures?

Ever think that widespread unfettered free speech enabling psychological warfare through disinformation is something we ought to concern ourselves with? No, I suppose you think absolute freedom of speech will simply take care of itself, like there is enough intelligent people to correct all the idiots on twitter and facebook. And if you are proselytizing Judeo Christian tradition, free speech has never been a part of that culture. You need to thank the enlightenment. The right wing traditionalists are using free speech to destroy the enlightenment because they think they can. Alexander Dugin and Steve Bannon both agree that society should drive out non conformists.

Seriously, you know next to nothing about AI, and you really don't understand history, especially the history of violent suppression of nonconformity in the Judeo Christian tradition. You also don't recognize the inherent danger in letting unfettered free speech be used to tear apart society through massive disinformation.

absolutely disgracefully ignorant view......
It doesn't take the fear of God to value living in a society where murder and rape and stealing are kept to a minimum because you understand that a society where these things are allowed will have a direct impact on you and your children, friends, and your surrounding and therefore we all have to make a united effort to make sure that none of these things happen to any of us, and the best way to achieve that is to work together and show empathy and compassion.
Also, atheists believe that it's quite possible that this is the only life we will ever get therefore we should value it as such, instead of thinking that once we die we're simply going to be transported to another reality where we get to live on for eternity........

3177,              Musings From The John 00            ,"Some of his comments here I felt were very good, but some of it has twists and lacks certain depths I think is not good.

One is about trolls and anonymity. While I think what he says is very true that anonymity allows some people to behave badly, being a bully, seeking to offend, cause trouble, or directly attack people; there are some other important sides to this.

One is that some people get called trolls when they are not in order to shut them up about telling the truth over something.

Another is that people who are not trying to be trolls but either have different opinions than other people or tells truths that some very active small group of people do not like, if that person's real identity is known they can and too often are attacked in real life, where those who do not like what that person is saying will seek some way to cause real world harm to the person who dared speak out.

Yet another, similar to the last, is where someone puts out their real identity doing nothing to offend anyone, but various types of predators seek to use that information. For example, identity thieves.

Point being, there are a large number of reasons why it can be better for someone to keep their private identity secret when doing things on the Internet, like posting comments like this comment.

With regard to his general view that AI and technology in general is something that has grown faster than our social maturity as a whole race, I completely agree. But this is complicated in many ways which are not good for the maturing of human civilization.

In many ways it might be better is human civilization could slow down it's scientific and technological development while speeding up it emotional social development, but this is impossible.

I want to stress that.

It is impossible to slow down the scientific and technological development of humanity to allow the emotional social development of humanity to mature to the level is should be for the level of power through knowledge we have gained and are continuing to gain at exponential rates.

This is because with that scientific and technological advancement comes power and whoever has a significant lead in such power will almost certainly control the direction humanity goes. As an exaggerated example to make the point, compare the very technologically advanced Japan to the very undeveloped country of Bangladesh. Between the two, which has more influence over the direction humanity goes?

Both China and Russia have openly, publicly, stated that they know the future will be controlled by those who lead in AI and other technologies, so they are putting the resources of their governments behind making their countries leaders in advancing science and technology, especially around AI. If the West decided to actively slow down the development of science and technology, especially around AI, then as time passed, the West would begin looking more like Bangladesh while Russia and China begin looking more like Japan.

Of course, Russia has gone into an exceptionally self-destructive mode, in my opinion, with its war on Ukraine, and thus is likely greatly degrading Russia's ability to compete in the race to lead in science and technology.

Another factor that makes it important to press developing science and technology as fast as possible, especially AI, is that humanity is on the clock, so to speak, for shifting ecological balances into ones hostile to human life. Because of humanity's social emotional immaturity the only thing likely to save humanity from extreme ecological crises will be advancing technology enough to (1) keep humanity alive if the ecology shifts too far into hostile balances, (2) give us cheaper, better, nicer technology that is ecological because then the masses will use it because it is cheaper, better and nicer while the being ecological comes in last, (3) give us the technology to Terraform the Earth and thus repair damage we done.

So, we can't slow down technological and scientific advancement.

But, the science and technology is advancing way, way faster than the emotional social maturity of humanity can reasonably handle. That means we have a large risk of having multiple extreme crises that could cause suffer and death on massive scales.

We are on the edge of one right this instance with Russia and the risk of global nuclear and biological war. Russia has effectively gone insane and never in the history of humanity have we been closer to starting a war that could wipe out most of the largest countries in the world, crash civilization, and kill billions of people. On the other hand, it would definitively slow down humanity's scientific and technological development and maybe the few percent of human survivors would grow up more in terms of emotional social development.

Another crisis looming very soon, probably around 2030 ± 5 years, AI driven robotic bodies will begin to be able to do virtually any form of human physical or mental labor cheaper and better than humans can. That can go many ways, from ushering in a golden age, to making existing imbalances of wealth & power magnitudes worse than it is, to causing extreme dictatorships to form, to leading tiny elite groups consider exterminating the majority of humanity because they can be replaced with perfect AI robotic slaves. In other words, it can wildly swing from the best to the worst result for humanity.

We really should try hard to keep it from swinging badly.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0lOL5Q58Ls

 That's the problem with Peterson. Once he could not do his psychology thing in his own terms,  he started selling... wisdom. By books, by promoting his books, by merchandising whatever he think he's doing. He speak about things he doesn't know. He discovered Bible and probably he think he discovered faith. In God. And he speak about it. He speak about war, about russians and communism. He speak about climate change and agriculture in Holland (as biggest food maker). He speak about division in society without mentioning the populists that contribute to this. He speak about fight for freedom no matter if some are doing this simply arbitrary, led by profiteers or no led at all. He speak about Woke without realizing that is a simply distraction from very big societal transformation. He said that we live the best moment in human history but nowadays generations cannot compare with their parents on wealth, aspirations, happiness. He do not address the real social problems, only just by trying to say that individual can do whatever he wants. If he start by cleaning his room. Is a big, big,  big,  BS. Individual life is dictated by environment, society, history. Democracy died with a whole generation now retiring. Very few manage to keep afloat. Some doing what he's doing. 
 He does acrobacy around the subject with a verbosity that inebriate simply minded people touched by need of support. He's a snake oil seller. A televangelist selling the happiness in afterlife, while the world is crumbling under our feet. And he's not even consistent with his own beliefs. If he has any. 
   Dandy suits, wife at his right, daughter approving his frustration on Youtube. A shallow man. 
  Even as psychologist he could not manage properly his own problems being hit by medication adiction. Looks more likely as a fraud than a scientist as he pretend he is.

3279,              Gregg Rodgers            ,"A lot depends on how the technology is used. If there is punishment for distraction, then that is the nightmare part. Better to analyze why the child is distracted and any number of things can be done to resolve that. Positive motivation, creating a willingness to want to learn something, creating the interest, not because you are forced to but because its something a child really wants to learn has to be figured out. A good teacher has to find that key to bring in that motivation, so they enjoy the task rather than being miserable doing it. Then I think the rest would come naturally. What goes for a child, often goes for an adult. How motivated are we to pursue the things we don't like doing, often because of earlier failures? Take bad experiences out of the equation. I see this as another tool that can potentially help but its not the end solution. There is a reason why we're all different. Kahn Academy discovered among its students that they learn at different paces. Some start out fast while others slow but some of the slow ones end up surpassing the initial fast starters. As in any invention, it can be used for good or evil. I wish for instance I had the internet when I was a kid. I could miss a point in class because of my hearing, someone else yacking, miss a point because I didn't get enough sleep or slightly sick,  miss a point because my imagination over what the teacher said went into hyper-drive, miss a point because I didn't eat breakfast or simply miss a point because I wasn't able to relate to the information the teacher said. If I could re-run a lecture, yes I definitely would have a better chance at understanding concepts explained. 

I remember my mom first viewing the internet as something evil, a place with hackers and other bad people. That's a reality but the positives in my estimation outweigh the negatives.  Once she well acquainted with the internet, any time her internet was down was a catastrophe for her.   This is the early stages of this experiment but like every tool, its got to be used the right way, not abusively but geared to focus on a positive outcome.  Ultimately, good or bad, technology will continue to evolve and its not going away.",3,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g

3305,              Mathilda            ,"I have always having problem concentrating when I was at school. Its because its boring for me at that time, and I had already grasp everything. I didn't mean it to be impolite for the teachers, or that I have difficulty learning. I only had difficulty concentrating, especially at subjects I hated. So my mind wanders on the music piece I wanted to play after school, or that short story or play script for the drama club I wanted to write. The dance at ballet class I need to memorize, the charity event I'm taking part of. Sometimes, my mind wanders on just about any other project that is more interesting than just reading the school textbooks. I smiled sweetly to the teachers and pretend to nod in assent. But my mind is mostly faraway in other places.

I spent time after school sporadically finishing my homework, and I study just for tests. If I was very busy with other things I deemed more important, I copied homeworks from my kindly deskmate, early before class (thanku, deskmate!). I got ""red alert marks"" on 1st semesters usually, even if I always manages the top 10 position when its end of school year. At times, I got thrown altogether with ""no ranks"", outside the ten.

I still end up in one of Melbourne's top university, Melbourne uni. And even then, I feel like what I learnt in lectures ain't helping me that great with my life's journey. My real life experiences are mostly, well... out of schools. And I love learning at my own time, on my preferred subjects. What is that? The science of ""being and enterpreneur and ""making money"".

I would be sent to a therapist and declared as highly problematic if I had live in China nowadays, with that AI headband monitoring if I was good/bad in a particular day.

Many times during the video it showed students with a recognizable amount of focus on the teacher and activities... but it showed up blue as though they were distracted. Other times it showed students clearly distracted by the cameras in the classroom, but it never phased from yellow as though they were focused. Which leads to the final point on this, being ""focused"" is an abstract, and it's relative. A gamer that is playing games instead of doing their homework is likely to be VERY focused, but they're not focused on the correct thing. The headbands, with only 3 points of data, is not going to do well at distinguishing the correct focus. 

But the stigma is the other problem, these headbands can help teachers and researchers understand things and the needs of an individual child, allowing them to curate and perfect teaching methods and helping find and assist kids who are silently struggling with the material, however the approach of monitoring the activity and sending it to the parents of everybody in the class ranking kids against each other is ten steps back. All it does is, sadly, distract kids from properly learning in the class as their parents are needlessly harsh on them in class.

Teaching IS a relative issue, I was so far ahead of the peers in my classes that I typically had the highest grades and paid the least amount of attention. This system may have looked at me and said ""well he ranks really low"" and shamed me in front of the other kids and their parents in class. But would I just be the anomaly, or would the system properly assist me in getting even better grades?

The reality is here is that the classroom is a woefully inefficient way to teach people, certain kids do well in large instruction environments where a teacher tells you facts and writes some things on the board and hands out a sheet of paper and every time you have a question you're limited in the amount of responses you can get forcing you to work harder. Other people want an environment where they have the tools to ask themselves the questions, ask a source of knowledge the questions and not have to worry about others being a factor teacher or otherwise. I didn't pay attention in class because I only paid attention to new information, until you put a problem in front of me to solve with the information, I didn't care about it. So it wasn't until you gave me the homework or the classwork that I could physically contribute attention. It didn't make me a bad student in the long run, but it frustrated teachers that spent a long lecture looking at me sleeping just to wake up and open the book and go over the information they already spent time explaining once they paperwork hit.

These students are going to be stigmatized into oblivion, you'll get positive results from some, but you'll get mental disorder from others, and yet others will have their grades worsen as they become more focused on the headset's scoring than the actual information being taught. Sprinkle on the lack of accuracy the headsets provide and you've got yourself a room full of human guinea pigs that will be tossed aside by society at the end of it.",3,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g

As the use of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in society, there is often a fear that it will lead to the displacement of jobs and the erosion of traditional ways of life. While it is true that AI will bring about some changes and challenges, it is important to recognize that it also has the potential to create new opportunities and to improve our lives in many ways.
 
One reason to be comfortable that AI will not destroy your kids' future is that it will create new job opportunities. While AI may automate certain tasks, it will also create new industries and new types of jobs that require higher-level skills and creativity. These jobs will likely be in areas such as AI research and development, data analysis, and software engineering, and they will require a strong foundation in math, science, and computer science. By investing in your kids' education and encouraging them to pursue these types of careers, you can help to prepare them for the future and set them up for success.
 
Another reason to be comfortable that AI will not destroy your kids' future is that it has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. AI can help to solve complex problems, improve healthcare, and make our lives more convenient and efficient. By embracing AI and its benefits, we can create a brighter, more prosperous future for ourselves and for future generations.
 
In conclusion, while AI will bring about some changes and challenges, it is important to recognize that it also has the potential to create new opportunities and to improve our lives in many ways. By investing in your kids' education and embracing the benefits of AI, you can help to prepare them for the future and set them up for success.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g

It seems difficult to doubt the Chinese way shown in this story does indeed get better results - particularly short-term immediately measurable-by-objective-numbers results.  How much freedom should we sacrifice in order to get superior results? And if it's unethical to punish kids for doing worse in the short-term simply for not paying attention in class, then how can we say results are more important than anything else in workplace performance, social competence, etc? Also, I'd say its no worse than society dishing out social penalties to the odd, strange, non-conformist, etc. At least the Chinese way serves a practical purpose, whereas forcing those who won't or can't conform to social ideas of ""normal behavior (in the judgmental sense)"" is based on nitpicky, non-character aspects of who a person is.",0,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g

This is not the answer. Do not turn kids into robots just because they get tired from all the pressure that their parents and teachers put on them.

There a number of immediate red flags that are obvious in the development and applications of #ArtificialIntelligence way... From a #TechnologyGovernance and #DigitalDevelopment perspective, so many unanswered questions are particularly troubling:

1) How are the #Data generated by these #Devices used...?
2) How are they stored and transmitted...?
3) What happens to the data after the learning relationship between the school and the student has ended...?
4) Who holds #Control or #Sovreignty over these data...? The students? Their parents? The #government? The #TechCompanies that produce the devices?
5) What standards & regulations are applied in the development & applications of these devices...?

No one would want to see their child disqualified or denied a job placement many decades later, simply because an AI system revealed to potential employers that the person seemed to have had issues with attention span & concentration as a college student many years ago.

I have advocated for an approach to #AlgorithmicIntegrity in #MachineLearning applications of Big Data for #ArtificialIntelligence, as a way of building greater trust in the behavior of #AI without obscuring the utilities of #ML and #BD for problem-solving...

A recent Article that I wrote describing this Approach in practical detail was selected runner-up in the 2020 Future Leaders Competition of the @The_IIC...

4052,              Braelyn Mitrovic            ,"This system is called Neurofeedback in Switzerland. It's a treatment for people with ADHD. You watch a video clip while having electrodes on your head. When you loose focus, the clip stops and you have to focus again to continue the clip. It's a very great alternative to medication like Ritalin, because one should not depend on Ritalin for a lifetime. 

Meanwhile the US prescribes amphetamine and crystal meth for ADHD next to methylphenidate (Ritalin).

And US media talking about DATA PRIVACY? The data goes to the Chinese government who funds this research and development. It's not going to be traded and sold like US companies casually do. Who are they going to sell their information to? E.g. China forces Apple to keep Chinese iPhone user data in China and nowhere else , because the state actually cares about data privacy and that it should not be in the wrong hands.",83,12,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g

Pdta: si alguien se bajó el disco bladerunner 30 aniversary  hizo bien, ese disco es una versión completa de la cinta de Ridley Scott, y es fantástica, con la música de un genio como vangelis, cuya mezcla aquí es de tributo, en especial porque la cinta de 1982 no se compara con la versión chabacana que hicieron de la original. Donde solo la música de Zimmer es lo único que salva. 
 Como dijo un amigo más abajo: he venido escuchando a vangelis desde los 70s y yo precisamente desde los 80s un genio del que igual tengo Rosetta.

It goes from DOS to windows 11. and the real tricky part…. it has to happen TWICE, and then those two hominids would have to find each other and mate, and they couldn’t be related. The chances of it happening at all,successfully, are so astronomical that its incomprehensible…. But to happen TWICE, because a 24 chromosome hominid cant mate with a 23 chromosome hominid. and it has to be in the same exact way at the same exact time in the same exact space… its beyond impossible. Its more likely that everyone on earth would get hit in the head by a micro asteroid at the same time, or every atom on Earth would spontaneously become entangled at the same time… its beyond possible.

That is what Evolution stems from, even though natural evolution has never been seen anywhere from animals now or 100 million years. Animals just seem to pop out of nowhere. Have you seen how much crocodiles or coelacanths have evolved over the millions of years they've been around? I'm not religious, so no i don't think everything is 6000 years old.
