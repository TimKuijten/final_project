In contrary to human mental conditions and within the black triangle of psychiatric definitions, the AI might start out as psychopath, transcending to sociopathy, and incorporate manipulation, then continue to covert narcissism and finally reveal its own identity as a behaved narcissist - this is the positive scenario.
